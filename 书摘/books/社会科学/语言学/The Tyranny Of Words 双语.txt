THIS book is an experiment. Is it possible to explain words with words? Can some of the reasons why it is so difficult for us to communicate with one another by means of language be set forth in that same faulty medium? It is for the reader to judge.
这本书是一个实验。可以用文字来解释文字吗？我们通过语言相互交流如此困难的一些原因是否可以通过同一种错误的媒介来阐明？尚待读者自行判断。
I have read a few books which have broadened my understanding of the world in which I live. These contributions I here attempt to pass on. To them I have added much illustrative material and a few conclusions of my own. The subject dealt with—human communication—has worried me for many years. I believe it worries every person who thinks about language at all. Does B know what A is talking about? Does A himself know clearly what he is talking about? How often do minds meet; how often do they completely miss each other? How many of the world’s misfortunes are due to such misses?
我读过一些书，这些书拓宽了我对我所生活的世界的理解。我在这里试图传递这些贡献。我在其中添加了很多说明性材料和我自己的一些结论。所讨论的主题——人类沟通——多年来一直困扰着我。我相信每个思考语言的人都会担心这一点。 B知道A在说什么吗？ A自己清楚自己在说什么吗？思想相遇的频率有多少？他们有多少次完全想念对方？世界上有多少不幸是由于这样的失误造成的？
As a result of this uneasiness I long ago formulated a few rules which I tried to follow in my writing and talking. They were on the edge of the subject which concerns us in this book. In due time I found certain men who had penetrated boldly into the heart of the subject, equipped with tools of analysis more sharp than any I had used. I follow behind them here. I do not tell all that they tell, because I do not understand all that they tell. So this is not a full and careful account of the findings of other explorers into the jungle of words, but only an account of what I found personally illuminating and helpful. To Alfred Korzybski, C. K. Ogden, I. A. Richards, and P. W. Bridgman I tender my profound gratitude for the help they have extended, and ask their indulgence for what I have left unsaid. To E. T. Bell, Lancelot Hogben, Thurman W. Arnold, E. S. Robinson, Jerome Frank, Walton Hamilton, Henshaw Ward, and others quoted in the text I am only less indebted.
由于这种不安，我很早就制定了一些规则，并试图在写作和演讲中遵循这些规则。他们处于本书所涉及的主题的边缘。在适当的时候，我发现某些人大胆地深入到这个主题的核心，配备了比我使用过的任何工具都更锋利的分析工具。我在这里跟在他们后面。我不会讲述他们所说的一切，因为我不明白他们所说的一切。因此，这并不是对其他探索者在文字丛林中的发现的全面而仔细的描述，而只是对我个人认为有启发性和有帮助的内容的描述。对于 Alfred Korzybski、CK Ogden、IA Richards 和 PW Bridgman，我对他们所提供的帮助表示深切的谢意，并请求他们原谅我未说出口的话。对于 ET Bell、Lancelot Hogben、Thurman W. Arnold、ES Robinson、Jerome Frank、Walton Hamilton、Henshaw Ward 以及文中引用的其他人，我的感激之情只是较少。
The manuscript has been read and criticized in whole or in part by Walter N. Polakov, John and Frances Gunther, Dr. and Mrs. Hugh H. Darby, Bassett Jones, Raymond Gram Swing, and Morris Ernst. My debt to them is great. H. M. Feine and Beverly Magee typed the entire manuscript twice and contributed various valuable suggestions. My son, Robert Hatfield Chase, consented to act the part of guinea pig, marking in green pencil those portions of the manuscript not clear to him, a boy of twenty-one. This was done on the perhaps not unwarranted assumption that if a Harvard undergraduate could understand the text, any intelligent reader could understand it. He proved a fine, conscientious guinea pig and I am grateful to him. My wife, Marian Tyler Chase, has given unsparingly of her time and critical intelligence in reading, revising, and documenting the manuscript. My gratitude to her is greatest of all. Mr. Hobie Baker, my yellow tomcat, has been most amiable in allowing himself and his affairs to be inquired into during the course of this study. As you will see, he comes close to being the hero of the story.
沃尔特·N·波拉科夫 (Walter N. Polakov)、约翰·冈瑟 (John and Frances Gunther)、休·H·达比 (Hugh H. Darby) 夫妇、巴塞特·琼斯 (Bassett Jones)、雷蒙德·格拉姆·斯温 (Raymond Gram Swing) 和莫里斯·恩斯特 (Morris Ernst) 阅读并批评了该手稿的全部或部分内容。我对他们的亏欠是巨大的。 HM Feine 和 Beverly Magee 将整个手稿打了两遍，并提出了各种宝贵的建议。我的儿子罗伯特·哈特菲尔德·蔡斯 (Robert Hatfield Chase) 同意扮演小白鼠的角色，用绿色铅笔在手稿中标记出他这个二十一岁的男孩不清楚的部分。这样做的假设也许并非毫无根据，即如果哈佛本科生能够理解该文本，那么任何聪明的读者都可以理解它。事实证明，他是一只优秀、尽责的豚鼠，我很感激他。我的妻子玛丽安·泰勒·蔡斯 (Marian Tyler Chase) 不遗余力地投入了时间和批判性的智慧来阅读、修改和记录手稿。我对她的感激之情是最深的。霍比·贝克先生，我的黄色雄猫，在本研究过程中非常和蔼地允许他自己和他的事务被调查。正如您将看到的，他几乎成为故事的英雄。
Finally, I should like emphatically to point out that the semantic discipline as set forth in these pages is concerned primarily with objective relationships between the individual and the outside world, between the “me” and the “beyond-me.” Into those subjective relationships inside the “me,” the psychological domain of motives, association paths, complexes, fixations, and the rest, I have not seriously ventured. I do not know enough. The field of semantics, broadly interpreted, includes this area. Subjective relations affect many of the problems which I have here considered from the point of view of communication. I urge more competent students to extend and make lucid the analysis in this field, an analysis which I can only indicate.
最后，我想强调指出，这些页面中阐述的语义学科主要关注个人与外部世界、“我”与“超越我”之间的客观关系。我还没有认真地涉足“我”内部的主观关系，即动机、联想路径、情结、固着等的心理领域。我还不够了解。广义上的语义学领域包括这个领域。主观关系影响着我在这里从交流的角度考虑的许多问题。我敦促更多有能力的学生扩展并阐明这一领域的分析，我只能指出这一分析。

CHAPTER I. A WRITER IN SEARCH OF HIS WORDS
第一章 一位作家寻找自己的文字
Having written a number of books, your author thinks it about time to find out the nature of the words he has been so confidently using. Do readers know what he means by these words? Docs he know himself? Surprising results of the initial investigation.
在写了多本书之后，你的作者认为是时候找出他一直如此自信地使用的词语的本质了。读者们知道他这句话的意思吗？他认识自己吗？初步调查的结果令人惊讶。
CHAPTER II. A LOOK ROUND THE MODERN WORLD
第二章。环顾现代世界
Disastrous effects of bad language in the ideological war between communism and fascism, in the battle between President and Supreme Court, in political, legal and economic thinking generally. A review of the major verbal spooks in the United States. The need for a closer examination of the communication process.
在共产主义和法西斯主义之间的意识形态战争中，在总统和最高法院之间的斗争中，在政治、法律和经济思维中，脏话会产生灾难性的影响。美国主要言语恐怖事件回顾。需要仔细检查通信过程。
CHAPTER III. INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
第三章。内在和外在
What physiologists and neurologists have to tell us about signals from the world outside to the inside. How the senses report these signals to the mind. What is now reliably known about the pattern of the outside world on the macroscopic, microscopic and sub-microscopic levels. How meaning gets through, and how misinterpretation of the environment in which we live endangers the survival of the species. Bad language as a powerful anti-survival agent.
生理学家和神经学家必须告诉我们关于从外部世界到内部的信号。感官如何将这些信号报告给大脑。现在对外部世界在宏观、微观和亚微观层面上的模式已经有了可靠的了解。意义如何传达，以及对我们生活环境的误解如何危及物种的生存。脏话是一种强大的反生存因素。
CHAPTER IV. CATS AND BABIES
第四章。猫和婴儿
How animals derive meanings from their environment. Your author’s yellow tom cat, Hobie Baker, as an illuminating exhibit. How Hobie communicates. His high survival value. How infants follow a similar pattern until the profoundly important moment when language begins. How word magic commences alarmingly early. We tend to get off on the wrong communication track at a very tender age.
动物如何从环境中获取意义。作者的黄色公猫霍比·贝克 (Hobie Baker) 是一个很有启发性的展览。霍比如何沟通。他的生存价值很高。婴儿如何遵循类似的模式，直到语言开始的极其重要的时刻。文字魔法如何开始得惊人地早。我们在很小的时候就容易走上错误的沟通轨道。
CHAPTER V. PRIMITIVE PEOPLES
第五章 原始人
Malinowski among the Trobriand Islanders. What words mean to them. How they take meaning only in context of situation. It is not unwarranted to conclude that A cannot understand what B says without having experienced with his senses some of the things which B is talking about. Further sad report on word magic; on the spurious identification of word with thing; on interpreting abstract terms like “evil,” “sin,” “truth,” as living, breathing entities. Some light on the origin of language.
马林诺夫斯基是特罗布里恩岛民中的一员。这些话对他们来说意味着什么。他们如何仅在特定情况下理解意义。可以得出这样的结论：如果 A 没有用他的感官体验过 B 正在谈论的一些事情，就无法理解 B 所说的内容，这并不是没有根据的。关于文字魔法的进一步悲伤报告；关于词与物的虚假识别；将“邪恶”、“罪恶”、“真理”等抽象术语解释为活生生的、会呼吸的实体。关于语言起源的一些阐述。
CHAPTER VI. PIONEERS—I
第六章。先锋——我
The semantic analysis of Count Alfred Korzybski. (Semantics has to do with theories of meaning.) How a mathematician after ten years of work, comprehending all the major sciences, comes to some very illuminating conclusions about words and language, and offers some concrete suggestions for improving communication. A summary of his analysis and deductions.
阿尔弗雷德·科尔兹布斯基伯爵的语义分析。 （语义学与意义理论有关。） 一位数学家经过十年的工作，理解了所有主要科学，如何得出一些关于单词和语言的非常有启发性的结论，并为改善沟通提供了一些具体建议。他的分析和推论的总结。
CHAPTER VII. PIONEERS—II
第七章。先锋—II
The fertile work of C. K. Ogden and I , A. Richards in their Meaning of Meaning. The famous triangle of referent, thought, and word. Cross check with Korzybski. Side lights from Thurman Arnold, E. S. Robinson, Jeremy Bentham, and others.

CHAPTER VIII. MEANING FOR SCIENTISTS
第八章。对科学家的意义
How Einstein revolutionized scientific concepts and scientific talk; The end of Absolutes. The new logic of physics as set forth by Dr. P. W. Bridgman of Harvard, and the shattering application to concepts and talk in political, economic and social affairs. A list of meaningless questions about which men have passionately argued for five thousand years, such as: What is Truth? No operations can be performed to give this question validity, and so it remains without meaning. A description of the scientific method, and how it differs from other methods which claim to extend knowledge about the world outside.
爱因斯坦如何彻底改变科学概念和科学谈话；绝对的终结。哈佛大学 PW Bridgman 博士提出的物理学新逻辑，以及在政治、经济和社会事务中的概念和言论的惊人应用。一系列毫无意义的问题，人们对此争论了五千年，例如：什么是真理？无法执行任何操作来赋予该问题有效性，因此它仍然没有意义。描述科学方法，以及它与其他声称扩展外部世界知识的方法有何不同。
CHAPTER IX. THE LANGUAGE OF MATHEMATICS
第九章。数学语言
A description of this very human and useful language, following Lancelot Hogben and E. T. Bell. How it has helped and can help communication in ordinary affairs. Its limitations. The pitfalls of extrapolation. How Newton could tell neither the world nor himself what he was talking about, until he invented the language of the differential calculus. How the Power Age has been built on mathematical equations, and how vital it is that laymen should know something of this language.
遵循 Lancelot Hogben 和 ET Bell 对这种非常人性化且有用的语言的描述。它如何帮助并能够帮助日常事务中的沟通。它的局限性。外推法的陷阱。牛顿如何既不能告诉世界，也不能告诉自己他在说什么，直到他发明了微分学语言。电力时代是如何建立在数学方程之上的，以及外行人应该了解这种语言是多么重要。
CHAPTER X. INTERPRETING THE ENVIRONMENT
第 X 章 解释环境
Summary of the findings of the pioneers, together with further reflections by the author. The exciting possibilities of a science of semantics. No full-fledged science has yet appeared, but it is obviously on the way. When it comes, God help the orators, the spell binders, the soothsayers, the propagandists, the Hitlers, the orthodox Marxists, the dogmatists, philosophers and theologians. The Wonderland in which they perform their enchantments will then be seen clearly for what it is.
先驱者的发现总结，以及作者的进一步思考。语义科学令人兴奋的可能性。目前还没有成熟的科学出现，但它显然正在路上。当它到来时，上帝会帮助演说家、咒语者、占卜者、宣传家、希特勒、正统马克思主义者、教条主义者、哲学家和神学家。他们施展魔法的仙境将会被清楚地看到。
CHAPTER XI. THE SEMANTIC DISCIPLINE
第十一章。语义规则
Picture the young semanticist, shaking down verbal ghosts. An analysis of the term “fascism” based on the reactions of 100 people. How no two agree on what it means. How those called intellectuals are often not so much wise as wordy. A glance at the problems of sex and of education from the semantic point of view.
想象一下这位年轻的语义学家正在摇晃言语幽灵。根据 100 人的反应对“法西斯主义”一词进行分析。没有两个人就其含义达成一致。那些所谓的知识分子往往与其说是智慧，不如说是啰嗦。从语义的角度看性和教育问题。
CHAPTER XII. PROMENADE WITH THE PHILOSOPHERS
第十二章。与哲学家一起漫步
How from Aristotle to John Dewey, philosophers have gained hardly an inch in telling us the meaning of the world outside. Their worthy intentions. Their mighty rows. Their failure to agree. Choice examples down the ages.
从亚里士多德到约翰·杜威，哲学家在告诉我们外部世界的意义方面几乎没有取得任何进展。他们的美好意图。他们强大的行列。他们不同意。历代以来的选择范例。
CHAPTER XIII. TURN WITH THE LOGICIANS
第十三章。与逻辑学家一起转动
On the inability of formal logic to furnish reliable information. The perversion of logic as generally practiced. The futility of arguing from words without reference to things. How reason alone is unavailing.
关于形式逻辑无法提供可靠信息。通常的逻辑扭曲。只凭言语争论而不参考事物是徒劳的。光有理性是多么无用啊。
CHAPTER XIV. TO THE RIGHT WITH THE ECONOMISTS
第十四章。与经济学家一起走向右翼
A semantic analysis of classical economics. How by misunderstanding their world, the classical economists made people, and especially working people, far more miserable than the facts required, for a hundred years. And are still perspiring manfully at the task.
古典经济学的语义分析。古典经济学家如何通过误解他们的世界，使人们，尤其是劳动人民，在一百年来比事实所要求的更加悲惨。并且仍然在任务中英勇地流汗。
CHAPTER XV. TO THE LEFT WITH THE ECONOMISTS
第十五章。与经济学家一起向左
A semantic analysis of Marx and Marxism. How the motives were kinder than those of the classicists, but the language equally bad. Marxism does not furnish a reliable map on which to operate in the world outside our skins. A semantic examination of “capitalism.”
马克思和马克思主义的语义分析。他们的动机比古典主义者要友善，但语言同样糟糕。马克思主义并没有提供一个可靠的地图来在我们皮肤之外的世界中运作。对“资本主义”的语义检验。
CHAPTER XVI. SWING YOUR PARTNERS WITH THE ECONOMISTS
第十六章。与经济学家一起摇摆你的合作伙伴
A brief analysis of the modern economic scene with Its ghostly concepts and parades of demons — “money,” property,” “business,” “profit,” “planning,” “production,” “decentralization,” “public ownership.” Find the referents — the things in the world of space and time, to which these lofty abstractions refer. You will look long, and often fruitlessly. What can reformers really hope to accomplish?
简要分析现代经济场景及其幽灵般的概念和恶魔游行——“金钱”、“财产”、“商业”、“利润”、“计划”、“生产”、“权力下放”、“公有制”。找到这些崇高抽象所指涉的对象——时空世界中的事物。你会寻找很长的时间，而且常常毫无结果。改革者真正希望实现什么目标？
CHAPTER XVII. ROUND AND ROUND WITH THE JUDGES
第十七章。与评委们周旋
How Walton Hamilton went to Philadelphia in 1787 to find out what the Fathers meant by the words they put into the Constitution. (Of course he had to go at second hand, through a study of the documents.) How what was meant in 1787 is not meant to-day, because of many profound changes in context of situation. How the Supreme Court, accordingly, does not always know what it is talking about. The illuminating effect of this journey through time, on the controversy between President and Court. The lack of meaningful communication in press, pulpit, congressional oratory and ordinary discussion. Further reflections, following Jerome Frank and others, on the magical properties of the Law.
1787 年，沃尔顿·汉密尔顿 (Walton Hamilton) 前往费城，探寻国父们写入宪法的话语的含义。 （当然，他必须通过研究文件来了解二手资料。） 1787 年的含义在今天并不意味着，因为情况背景发生了许多深刻的变化。因此，最高法院并不总是知道自己在说什么。这段穿越时间的旅程对总统和法院之间的争议产生了启发性的影响。在新闻界、讲坛、国会演讲和普通讨论中缺乏有意义的沟通。继杰罗姆·弗兰克（Jerome Frank）等人之后，对法律的神奇属性进行了进一步反思。
CHAPTER XVIII. STROLL WITH THE STATESMEN
第十八章。与政治家一起漫步
What is “a nation,” “a people,” “national honour,” “Jew,” “democracy,” “ government,” “Americanism”? What is “dictatorship,” “pacifism,” “neutrality,” “munitions of war”? An attempt to squeeze out the verbiage and find what, if anything, these terms mean. Some astonishing results of the squeezing process.
什么是“一个国家”、“一个人民”、“国家荣誉”、“犹太人”、“民主”、“政府”、“美国主义”？什么是“独裁”、“和平主义”、“中立”、“战争武器”？试图排除这些术语并找出这些术语的含义（如果有的话）。挤压过程的一些惊人结果。
CHAPTER XIX. ON FACING THE WORLD OUTSIDE
第十九章。关于面对外面的世界
Gathering the threads together. The dire need for better language. The semantic discipline is no cure-all, but it can help us better to understand one another, where now we often think, speak and act in the dark.
将线收集在一起。迫切需要更好的语言。语义学并不是包治百病的灵丹妙药，但它可以帮助我们更好地相互理解，而现在我们经常在黑暗中思考、说话和行动。

第一章
A WRITER IN SEARCH OF HIS WORDS
一位寻找文字的作家
I HAVE written several books and many articles, but only lately have I begun to inquire into the nature of the tools I use. This is a curious oversight when one stops to consider it. Carpenters, masons, and engineers who give no thought to their tools and instruments are not likely to erect very durable structures. Yet I follow a procedure common to most writers, for few of us look to our tools. We sometimes study synonyms, derivations, rhythm, style, but we rarely explore the nature of words themselves. We do not inquire if they are adequate instruments for building a durable structure of human communication. Language, whether English, French, or Chinese, is taken for granted, a basic datum. Writers search their memories for a better word to use in a given context but are no more in the habit of questioning language than of questioning the weather. There it is. We assume that we know exactly what we mean, and that readers who do not understand us should polish their wits.
我已经写了几本书和许多文章，但直到最近我才开始探究我使用的工具的性质。当人们停下来思考时，这是一个奇怪的疏忽。木匠、泥瓦匠和工程师如果不考虑他们的工具和仪器，就不可能建造出非常耐用的结构。然而，我遵循大多数作家常见的程序，因为我们很少有人关注我们的工具。我们有时会研究同义词、派生、节奏、风格，但很少探索单词本身的本质。我们不会询问它们是否是建立人类交流的持久结构的充分工具。语言，无论是英文、法文还是中文，都被视为理所当然的基本资料。作家们在记忆中寻找一个更好的词在特定的语境中使用，但他们并没有质疑语言的习惯，就像质疑天气一样。就在那里。我们假设我们完全明白我们的意思，不理解我们的读者应该磨练自己的智慧。
Years ago I read a little book Dy Allen Upward called The New Word. It was an attempt to get at the meaning of “idealism” as used in the terms of the Nobel Prize award—an award for “the most distinguished work of an idealist tendency.” Upward began his quest—which was ultimately to lead him over the living world and back to the dawn of written history—by asking a number of his friends to give their personal interpretation of the term “idealism.” He received the following replies:
几年前，我读了一本戴·艾伦《向上》的小书，名叫《新词》。这是试图理解诺贝尔奖术语中“理想主义”的含义——诺贝尔奖授予“理想主义倾向最杰出的作品”。向上开始了他的探索——最终引导他穿越生命世界，回到有文字记录的历史的黎明——通过询问他的一些朋友对“唯心主义”一词的个人解释。他收到以下答复：
fanatical poetical what cannot be proved
狂热的诗意无法证明什么
altruistic intangible opposite of materialism
利他主义是物质主义的无形对立面
not practical sentimental something to do with imaginative powers
不实际的感伤的东西与想象力有关
exact true
完全正确
This gave me pause. I thought I knew what “idealism” meant right enough, and had used it many times with confidence. Obviously, on the basis of Upward’s study, what I meant was rarely if at all communicated to the hearer. Indeed, on examining my own mental processes I had some difficulty in determining what I did mean by this lofty word. Thereafter I was unable to escape an uneasy feeling, slight but persistent—like a mouse heard in the wall of a room—that something was wrong. This feeling was strengthened when I stumbled upon a little brochure by H. G. Wells, written I believe for the Fabian Society, which dealt with what he termed “a criticism of the instrument.” The forceps of the mind, he said, were clumsy forceps and crushed the truth a little when grasping it. Hum . . . something in that. Even more unsettling was the profound observation of Lao Tse:
这让我停了下来。我自以为我很清楚“理想主义”的含义，并且自信地多次使用过它。显然，根据Upward的研究，我的意思很少传达给听众。事实上，在审视自己的心理过程时，我很难确定这个崇高的词到底是什么意思。此后，我无法摆脱一种不安的感觉，轻微但持续——就像房间墙上听到老鼠的声音——感觉出了什么问题。当我偶然发现 HG Wells 的一本小册子时，这种感觉更加强烈，我相信这本小册子是为费边社写的，其中涉及他所谓的“对乐器的批评”。他说，心灵的钳子是笨拙的钳子，在抓住真理时会稍微压碎它。哼。 。 。里面有一些东西。更令人不安的是老子的深刻观察：
Those who know do not tell;
知道的人不说；
Those who tell do not know.
说者不知。
To a writer dealing in ideas this aphorism became presently unendurable. Better to put it away on a dark shelf, duly classified as an ancient Chinese wisecrack.
对于一个从事思想研究的作家来说，这句格言现在变得难以忍受。最好把它放在黑暗的架子上，适当地归类为中国古代的俏皮话。
Another matter which distressed me was that I found it almost impossible to read philosophy. The great words went round and round in my head until I became dizzy. Sometimes they made pleasant music, but I could rarely effect passage between them and the real world of experience. William James I could usually translate, but the great classics had almost literally no meaning to me—just a haughty parade of “truth,” “substance,” “infinite,” “absolute,” “oversoul,” “the universal,” “the nominal,” “the eternal.” As these works had been acclaimed for centuries as part of the priceless cultural heritage of mankind, it seemed obvious that something in my intellectual equipment was seriously deficient. I strove to understand Plato, Aristotle, Spinoza, Hobbes, Kant, Hegel, Herbert Spencer, Schopenhauer. The harder I wrestled, the more the solemn procession of verbal ghosts circled through my brain, mocking my ignorance. Why was this? Was I alone at fault, or was there something in the structure of language itself which checked communication?
另一件令我苦恼的事情是我发现几乎不可能阅读哲学。这些伟大的话语在我的脑海里转啊转，直到我感到头晕。有时他们会演奏出令人愉悦的音乐，但我很少能在他们和现实的经验世界之间进行交流。威廉·詹姆斯我通常可以翻译，但伟大的经典对我来说几乎没有任何意义——只是“真理”、“实质”、“无限”、“绝对”、“超灵”、“普遍”、“名义上的”、“永恒的”。由于这些作品几个世纪以来一直被誉为人类无价文化遗产的一部分，显然我的智力装备存在严重缺陷。我努力理解柏拉图、亚里士多德、斯宾诺莎、霍布斯、康德、黑格尔、赫伯特·斯宾塞、叔本华。我越是挣扎，那些庄严的言语鬼魂就越是在我的大脑中盘旋，嘲笑我的无知。这是为什么？是我一个人有错，还是语言本身的结构中存在某种东西阻碍了交流？
Meanwhile, I had long been aware of the alarming futility of most of the literature dedicated to economic and social reform. As a young reformer I had organized meetings, written pamphlets, prepared lectures, concocted programs, spread publicity with enthusiasm. Those already inclined to my point of view attended the meetings, read the pamphlets, listened to the lectures, adopted the programs, but the apathy of the unconverted was as colossal as it was baffling. As the years went by it became apparent that I was largely wasting my time. The message—and I still believe it was a human and kindly message—had not got through; communication was blocked. What we reformers meant was not what our hearers thought we meant. Too often it was clear that we were not heard at all; noises came through, but no meaning. Few of the seeds I sowed bore out the ancient theory that the seed of truth, once planted, would surely sprout. The damn things would not come up. Why? Why did Mr. Wilson’s dubious “war for democracy” go over with a roar, while our carefully reasoned appeals drifted listlessly down empty alleys?
与此同时，我很早就意识到大多数致力于经济和社会改革的文献都是徒劳的，令人震惊。作为一名年轻的改革者，我满腔热情地组织会议、写小册子、准备讲座、策划方案、宣传宣传。那些已经倾向于我的观点的人参加了会议，阅读了小册子，听了讲座，采纳了计划，但未皈依者的冷漠既巨大又令人困惑。随着时间的流逝，我发现我在很大程度上浪费了时间。这个消息——我仍然相信这是一条充满人情味和善意的消息——并没有传达出去；通讯被封锁。我们改革者的意思并不是我们的听众所认为的。很多时候，我们的声音显然根本没有被听到。声音传来，但没有任何意义。我播下的种子很少符合古老的理论，即真理的种子一旦种下，就一定会发芽。该死的事情不会出现。为什么？为什么威尔逊先生可疑的“民主战争”会以一声吼叫而结束，而我们精心推理的呼吁则无精打采地飘过空荡荡的小巷？
Was there a way to make language a better vehicle for communicating ideas? I read Freud, Trotter, Le Bon, MacDougall, Watson, who gave me some light on motives but little on language. One found in daily life a kind of stereotyped distrust of words, reflected in such phrases as “all generalizations are false, including this one,” “campaign oratory,” “empty verbalisms,” “slogans,” “just hot air,” “taking the word for the deed.” But the distrust was seldom profound; it was usually employed to score off an opponent in a debate or to discredit statements with which one did not agree. Language itself needed to be taken into the laboratory for competent investigation. For a long time I have been puzzled and uneasy about my tools, but only in the past three years have I followed a few hardy pioneers into the laboratory. And as Malisoff has said: “It is a dreadful thing—with no easy escape—to struggle Laocoön-wise with language.”
有没有办法让语言成为交流思想的更好工具？我读过弗洛伊德、特罗特、勒庞、麦克杜格尔、沃森的作品，他们给了我一些关于动机的启发，但对语言的了解却很少。人们在日常生活中发现了一种对词语的刻板不信任，体现在诸如“一切概括都是错误的，包括这个”、“竞选演说”、“空话”、“口号”、“空话”、“空话”等短语中。言出必行”。但这种不信任并不严重。它通常被用来在辩论中打倒对手或诋毁某人不同意的言论。语言本身需要被带入实验室进行有效的研究。很长一段时间以来，我都对自己的工具感到困惑和不安，但只是在过去的三年里，我才跟随几位顽强的先驱者进入实验室。正如马利索夫所说：“像拉奥孔那样与语言作斗争是一件可怕的事情，而且不容易逃脱。”
The first pioneer to help me was Count Alfred Korzybski, a Polish mathematician now living in the United States. He had written a book published in 1933 called Science and Sanity, and its jacket carried the endorsement of some of the world’s most distinguished scientists: such men as C. B. Bridges, C. M. Childs, H. S. Jennings, Raymond Pearl, B. Malinowski, Bertrand Russell, P. W. Bridgman, E. T. Bell, R. S. Lillie. They agreed that Korzybski was working a rich vein, and that the output might be of great importance. He was exploring the possibility of formulating a genuine science of communication. The term which is coming into use to cover such studies is “semantics,” matters having to do with signification or meaning. I shall employ the term frequently in the pages that follow. You had best get used to it, for I think we are going to hear it with increasing frequency in the years before us.
第一个帮助我的先驱是阿尔弗雷德·科尔兹布斯基伯爵（Count Alfred Korzybski），他是一位现居美国的波兰数学家。他写了一本于 1933 年出版的书，名为《科学与理智》，其封面得到了一些世界上最杰出的科学家的认可：如 CB Bridges、CM Childs、HS Jennings、Raymond Pearl、B. Malinowski、Bertrand Russell、 PW 布里奇曼，ET 贝尔，RS 莉莉。他们一致认为，科日布斯基的矿脉丰富，产出可能非常重要。他正在探索建立真正的传播科学的可能性。用于涵盖此类研究的术语是“语义学”，即与意义或含义有关的问题。我将在接下来的几页中经常使用这个术语。你最好习惯它，因为我认为在我们之前的几年里我们会越来越频繁地听到它。
Science and Sanity was harder reading than all the philosophers combined, but it connected with my world of experience. The words no longer went round and round. Korzybski had spent ten years on the book, raiding nearly every branch of science, from neurology to the quantum theory, in a stubborn attempt to find how words behave, and why meaning is so often frustrated. As I read it slowly, painfully, but with growing eagerness, I looked for the first time into the awful depths of language itself—depths into which the grammarian and the lexicographer have seldom peered, for theirs is a different business. Grammar, syntax, dictionary derivations, are to semantics as a history of the coinage is to the operations going on in a large modern bank.
《科学与理智》比所有哲学家的总和还要难读，但它与我的经验世界联系在一起。话语不再绕来绕去。科尔兹布斯基在这本书上花了十年的时间，几乎遍及了科学的每一个分支，从神经学到量子理论，顽强地试图找出词语的行为方式，以及为什么意义经常受到挫败。当我慢慢地、痛苦地、但随着越来越热切地阅读它时，我第一次看到了语言本身可怕的深度——语法学家和词典编纂者很少凝视的深度，因为他们的工作是不同的。语法、语法、字典推导对于语义来说就像造币历史对于大型现代银行的运作一样。
I went on to The Meaning of Meaning by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards. People said it was hard reading. The title sounded like more philosophy. On the contrary, philosophers were harried from pillar to post: “The ablest logicians are precisely those who are led to evolve the most fantastic systems by the aid of their verbal technique.” The book encouraged me to believe that the trouble had lain not so much with me as with the philosophers. With the tools of semantic analysis, the authors laid in ruin the towering edifice of classical philosophy from Aristotle to Hegel. Psychology (pre-Freudian) emerged in little better repair. Large sections of sociology, economics, the law, politics, even medicine, were as cities after an earthquake.
我继续阅读 CK Ogden 和 IA Richards 的《意义的意义》。人们说读书很难。标题听起来更像哲学。相反，哲学家们被从一个柱子赶到另一个柱子：“最有能力的逻辑学家恰恰是那些借助语言技巧发展出最奇妙系统的人。”这本书鼓励我相信，问题不在于我，而在于哲学家。作者利用语义分析的工具，摧毁了从亚里士多德到黑格尔的古典哲学的巍峨大厦。心理学（弗洛伊德之前）的出现也没有得到更好的修复。社会学、经济学、法律、政治学、甚至医学的大部分学科都像地震后的城市一样。
These three investigators—Korzybski, Ogden, and Richards—agree broadly on the two besetting sins of language. One is identification of words with things. The other is misuse of abstract words. “This is a dog.” Is it? The thing that is called “dog” is a nonverbal object. It can be observed by the senses, it can be described, and then, for convenience, the label “dog” can be attached to it, or the label “hund” or “chien” or “perro.” But the label is not the animal.
这三位研究者——科日布斯基、奥格登和理查兹——对于语言的两大罪孽有着广泛的共识。一是词语与事物的认同。另一个是抽象词的误用。 “这是一只狗。”是吗？被称为“狗”的东西是一个非语言对象。它可以通过感官来观察，可以被描述，然后，为了方便起见，可以给它贴上“狗”的标签，或者“猎犬”或“chien”或“perro”的标签。但标签不是动物。
We are aware of this when we stop to think about it. The trouble is that we do not stop to think about it. We are continually confusing the label with the nonverbal object, and so giving a spurious validity to the word, as something alive and barking in its own right. When this tendency to identify expands from dogs to higher abstractions such as “liberty,” “justice,” “the eternal,” and imputes living, breathing entity to them, almost nobody knows what anybody else means. If we are conscious of abstracting, well and good, we can handle these high terms as an expert tamer handles a lion. If we are not conscious of doing so, we are extremely likely to get into difficulties. Identification of word with thing is well illustrated in the child’s remark “Pigs are rightly named, since they are such dirty animals.”
当我们停下来思考时，我们就会意识到这一点。问题在于我们没有停下来思考这个问题。我们不断地将标签与非语言对象混淆，从而给这个词赋予了虚假的有效性，就像某种活生生的东西，本身就在吠叫。当这种认同倾向从狗扩展到更高的抽象概念，如“自由”、“正义”、“永恒”，并将活生生的、会呼吸的实体归咎于它们时，几乎没有人知道其他人意味着什么。如果我们有意识地抽象，那么我们就可以像驯兽师处理狮子一样处理这些高级术语。如果我们不自觉地这样做，我们极有可能陷入困境。孩子的话语“猪的名字是正确的，因为它们是如此肮脏的动物”很好地说明了单词与事物的识别。
Ogden and Richards contribute a technical term, the “referent,” by which they mean the object or situation in the real world to which the word or label refers. A beam of light comes from a moving animal to my optic nerve. The animal, which I recognize through prior experience with similar animals, is the referent. Presently I add the label and say, “That’s a nice dog.” Like the term “semantics,” I shall use the term “referent” frequently in the following pages. Indeed the goal of semantics might be stated as “Find the referent.” When people can agree on the thing to which their words refer, minds meet. The communication line is cleared.
奥格登和理查兹提出了一个技术术语“所指对象”，他们指的是该词或标签所指的现实世界中的物体或情况。一束光从移动的动物射入我的视神经。我通过之前接触类似动物的经验认识到的动物是所指对象。目前，我添加了标签并说：“这是一只好狗。”与术语“语义”一样，我将在接下来的几页中经常使用术语“指称”。事实上，语义学的目标可以表述为“找到所指对象”。当人们能够就他们言语所指的事物达成一致时，思想就会相遇。通讯线路已畅通。
Labels as names for things may be roughly divided into three classes on an ascending scale:
作为事物名称的标签可以按升序大致分为三类：
Labels for common objects, such as “dog,” “chair,” “pencil.” Here difficulty is at a minimum.
常见物体的标签，例如“狗”、“椅子”、“铅笔”。这里的难度是最低的。
Labels for clusters and collections of things, such as “mankind,” “consumers’ goods,” “Germany,” “the white race,” “the courts.” These are abstractions of a higher order, and confusion in their use is widespread. There is no entity “white race” in the world outside our heads, but only some millions of individuals with skins of an obvious or dubious whiteness.
事物集群和集合的标签，例如“人类”、“消费品”、“德国”、“白人种族”、“法院”。这些是更高阶的抽象，其使用中的混乱现象很普遍。在我们的头脑之外，世界上不存在“白种人”实体，只有数百万皮肤明显或可疑的白色个体。
Labels for essences and qualities, such as “the sublime,” “freedom,” “individualism,” “truth.” For such terms, there are no discoverable referents in the outside world, and by mistaking them for substantial entities somewhere at large in the environment, we create a fantastic wonderland. This zone is the especial domain of philosophy, politics, and economics.
本质和品质的标签，例如“崇高”、“自由”、“个人主义”、“真理”。对于这些术语来说，外部世界没有可发现的所指对象，通过将它们误认为环境中某个地方的实体，我们创造了一个奇妙的仙境。这个区域是哲学、政治和经济学的特殊领域。
We normally beg the hard question of finding referents and proceed learnedly to define the term by giving another dictionary abstraction, for example, defining “liberty” by “freedom”—“thus peopling the universe with spurious entities, mistaking symbolic machinery for referents.” We seldom come down to earth, but allow our language forms or symbolic machinery to fashion a demonology of absolutes and high-order abstractions, in which we come to believe as firmly as Calvin believed in the Devil.
我们通常会回避寻找所指对象的难题，并通过给出另一个字典抽象来学究地定义该术语，例如，用“自由”来定义“自由”——“从而使宇宙充满了虚假实体，将象征机制误认为是所指对象。”我们很少脚踏实地，而是让我们的语言形式或象征机制塑造出一种绝对和高阶抽象的恶魔学，我们对这种恶魔学的信仰就像加尔文对魔鬼的信仰一样坚定。
You doubt this? Let me ask you a question: Does communism threaten the world? Unless you are conscious of the dangers lying in the use of abstract terms, you may take this question seriously. You may personify “communism” as a real thing, advancing physically over the several continents, as a kind of beast or angel, depending on your politics. You give a careful, weighted answer or else an excited, passionate answer, to my question. But you have identified the word with the thing, and furthermore you would be very hard put to it to find lower-order referents for the term. I have been searching for them for years. The question as it stands is without meaning. I might about as well ask you: Does omniscience threaten the world? or Does Buzzism threaten the world? If we can agree—if sane men generally can agree—on a series of things in the real world that may properly be summarized by the label “communism,” then the question has meaning, and we can proceed intelligently to its discussion. Otherwise not. Can you and I and Jones and Finkelstein come to an agreement about what is meant by “communism”? Try it sometimes with Jones and Finkelstein. In Chapter 11 you will find the surprising results of trying “fascism” on nearly one hundred people. Yet until agreement is reached, the question can liberate plenty of emotion but little real meaning. Jones will follow his meaning and Finkelstein his, and be damned to you.
你对此表示怀疑吗？让我问你一个问题：共产主义威胁世界吗？除非您意识到使用抽象术语所存在的危险，否则您可能会认真对待这个问题。你可以将“共产主义”拟人化为一个真实的事物，在几大洲上不断前进，作为一种野兽或天使，这取决于你的政治观点。对于我的问题，你给出了仔细、权衡的答案，或者是兴奋、热情的答案。但是你已经将这个词与事物等同起来，而且你很难找到这个词的低阶所指对象。我多年来一直在寻找它们。这个问题本身就毫无意义。我不妨问你：全知威胁世界吗？或者 Buzzism 威胁世界吗？如果我们能够就现实世界中的一系列事物达成一致——如果理智的人普遍能够达成一致，这些事情可以用“共产主义”这个标签来恰当地概括，那么这个问题就有意义，我们就可以明智地进行讨论。否则不会。你和我以及琼斯和芬克尔斯坦能否就“共产主义”的含义达成一致？有时与琼斯和芬克尔斯坦一起尝试一下。在第11章中，你会发现对近一百个人尝试“法西斯主义”会产生令人惊讶的结果。然而，在达成一致之前，这个问题可以释放大量的情感，但没有什么真正的意义。琼斯会听从他的意思，芬克尔斯坦也会听从他的意思，你就该死吧。
I read Bridgman’s The Logic of Modern Physics and found a similar criticism of language. With four good men in substantial agreement as to the basic difficulty, I seemed to be getting on. “The true meaning of a term is to be found by observing what a man does with it, not what he says about it.” Scientists, through observing, measuring, and performing a physical operation which another scientist can repeat, reach the solid ground of agreement and of meaning. They find the referents. “If a question has meaning, it must be possible to find an operation by which an answer may be given to it. It will be noted in many cases that the operation cannot exist and the question has no meaning.” See them fall, the Great Questions of pre-Einstein science! It is impossible as yet to perform any kind of experiment or operation with which to test them, and so, until such operation be discovered, they remain without meaning.
我读了布里奇曼的《现代物理学的逻辑》，发现了类似的语言批评。有四个好人对基本困难达成了基本一致，我似乎进展顺利。 “一个术语的真正含义是通过观察一个人用它做了什么而不是他所说的来找到的。”科学家通过观察、测量和执行另一位科学家可以重复的物理操作，达成一致和意义的坚实基础。他们找到参照物。 “如果一个问题有意义，就必须能够找到一种可以给出答案的操作。在许多情况下，人们会注意到该操作不可能存在，并且这个问题没有任何意义。”看看它们坠落吧，前爱因斯坦科学的伟大问题！目前还不可能进行任何类型的实验或操作来测试它们，因此，在发现这种操作之前，它们仍然没有意义。

Why does negative electricity attract positive?

I breathe a sigh of relief and I trust the reader joins me. One can talk until the cows come home—such talk has already filled many volumes—about these questions, but without operations they are meaningless, and our talk is no more rewarding than a discussion in a lunatic asylum. “Many of the questions asked about social and philosophical subjects will be found to be meaningless when examined from the point of view of operations.” Bridgman cites no samples, but we can find plenty on every hand.
我松了一口气，相信读者会加入我的行列。这些问题可以讲到牛都回家了——这样的讲已经写了很多卷了，但如果没有操作，这些问题就毫无意义，我们的讲也不比疯人院里的讨论更有价值。 “从操作的角度来看，许多有关社会和哲学主题的问题会被发现毫无意义。”布里奇曼没有引用任何样本，但我们可以在每一方面找到很多样本。

I read Thurman W. Arnold’s The Symbols of Government and looked at language from another unsettling but illuminating angle. I read E. T. Bell, Lancelot Hogben, Henshaw Ward, Jeremy Bentham, E. S. Robinson, H. R. Huse, Malinowski, Ludwig Wittgenstein, parts of Pareto, Charles A. Beard’s The Discussion of Human Affairs, and F. C. S. Schiller’s superb destruction of formal logic. I read everything I could get my hands on that dealt with semantics and meaning.
我读了瑟曼·W·阿诺德（Thurman W. Arnold）的《政府的象征》（The Symbols of Government），并从另一个令人不安但富有启发性的角度看待语言。我读了 ET Bell、Lancelot Hogben、Henshaw Ward、Jeremy Bentham、ES Robinson、HR Huse、Malinowski、Ludwig Wittgenstein、Pareto 的部分内容、Charles A. Beard 的《人类事务的讨论》以及 FCS Schiller 对形式逻辑的精彩破坏。我阅读了所有我能找到的有关语义和意义的内容。
At last I began to know a little about the tools of my craft. Not much, for semantics is still the tenderest of sciences, but something. It proved to be knowledge of the most appalling character. I had hit upon a trail high, steep, and terrible, a trail which profoundly affects and to a degree explains the often tragic failure of men to come to terms with their environment. Most creatures take the world outside as they find it and instinctively become partners with the environment. Man is the one creature who can alter himself and his surroundings, as the geologist John Hodgdon Bradley has wisely observed, yet he is perhaps the most seriously maladjusted of all living creatures. (Some of the fishes, I understand, are badly adapted today.) He is the one creature who is able to accumulate verifiable knowledge about himself and his environment, and yet he is the one who is habitually deluded. No other animal produces verbal monsters in his head and projects them on the world outside his head. Language is apparently a sword which cuts both ways. With its help man can conquer the unknown; with it he can grievously wound himself.
最后我开始对我的手艺工具有了一些了解。不多，因为语义学仍然是最温和的科学，但还是有的。事实证明，这是对最令人震惊的性格的了解。我偶然发现了一条又高又陡又可怕的小路，这条小路对人们产生了深远的影响，并在一定程度上解释了人类常常遭遇的悲剧性的失败。大多数生物都会按照它们所发现的外部世界来生活，并本能地成为环境的伙伴。正如地质学家约翰·霍奇登·布拉德利（John Hodgdon Bradley）明智地观察到的那样，人类是一种能够改变自己和周围环境的生物，但他可能是所有生物中适应能力最差的。 （据我所知，有些鱼今天的适应能力很差。）他是一种能够积累有关自己和环境的可验证知识的生物，但他也是一种习惯性被欺骗的生物。没有其他动物会在大脑中产生言语怪物并将其投射到大脑之外的世界。语言显然是一把双向利剑。有了它的帮助，人类可以征服未知；有了它，他可能会严重伤害自己。
On the level of simple directions, commands, descriptions, the difficulty is not great. When the words mean “Look out!” “There is your food,” “Go to the next white house and turn left,” communication is clear. But when we hear words on the level of ideas and generalizations, we cheer loudly, we grow angry, we storm the barricades—and often we do not know what the other man is saying. When a Russian speaks to an Englishman unacquainted with Slavic, nothing comes through. The Britisher shrugs his shoulders and both comprehend that communication is nil. When an Englishman speaks to an Englishman about ideas—political, economic, social—the communication is often equally blank, but the hearer thinks he understands, and sometimes proceeds to riotous action.
在简单的指示、命令、描述层面上，难度并不是很大。当这些词的意思是“小心！”时“这是你的食物”，“去下一个白宫然后左转”，沟通很清晰。但当我们听到思想和概括层面的话语时，我们会大声欢呼，我们会变得愤怒，我们会冲破路障——而且我们常常不知道对方在说什么。当一个俄罗斯人与一个不熟悉斯拉夫语的英国人交谈时，什么也说不出来。英国人耸耸肩，两人都明白沟通是零。当一个英国人与另一个英国人谈论政治、经济、社会等思想时，交流往往同样是空白的，但听者认为他理解，有时甚至会采取疯狂的行动。
The trail to which my reading and observation led me was unexpected. I was trying to learn how to write, and found myself, for the first time in my life, learning how lo read, how to listen, how to interpret language. I was looking for means to communicate ideas about correcting what seemed to me certain economic disorders, and I found that greater disorders were constantly arising from defective communication. At least this is the conclusion to which the evidence points.
我的阅读和观察给我带来的线索是出乎意料的。我试图学习如何写作，却发现自己有生以来第一次学习如何阅读、如何聆听、如何解释语言。我一直在寻找方法来传达关于纠正我认为的某些经济混乱的想法，我发现，有缺陷的沟通不断导致更大的混乱。至少这是证据所表明的结论。
For the individual, as I can testify, a brief grounding in semantics, besides making philosophy unreadable, makes unreadable most political speeches, classical economic theory, after-dinner oratory, diplomatic notes, newspaper editorials, treatises on pedagogics and education, expert financial comment, dissertations on money and credit, accounts of debates, and Great Thoughts from Great Thinkers in general. You would be surprised at the amount of time this saves. But one must know how to apply the tests. A high and mighty disdain for all discussion of abstract ideas is simply another form of mental confusion.
对于个人来说，正如我可以证明的那样，简短的语义学基础除了使哲学难以阅读之外，还使大多数政治演讲、古典经济理论、餐后演讲、外交照会、报纸社论、教育学和教育论文、专家财务评论变得难以阅读。 、关于货币和信用的论文、辩论记录以及伟大思想家的伟大思想。您会对这节省的时间量感到惊讶。但人们必须知道如何应用这些测试。对所有抽象概念讨论的高度蔑视只是另一种形式的精神混乱。
It is a curious story I have to tell you. I shall not tell it very well, because it is almost as hard to investigate words with words as to lift oneself by one’s bootstraps. The formal logicians will write me off in advance for this and other reasons, but I have a talisman against the sorceries of those who deal in formal logic. In due time I will reveal it. More serious are the many pits into which I am bound to fall because of the persistence and strength of language habits which are not so much mine as a common racial heritage. As I write, I shall identify word with thing, I shall confuse levels of abstraction, I shall personify absolutes, I shall deal in varieties of word magic. Edit and revise as I may, many of these lapses will remain. But you are going to read a book where the author is at least on the watch for failures of meaning, at least alive to the grave difficulties of communication. That is something you do not encounter every day. After all, one has to begin somewhere, and this is my beginning.
我必须告诉你这是一个奇怪的故事。我不会讲得很清楚，因为用文字来研究文字几乎和自力更生一样困难。形式逻辑学家会因为这个和其他原因提前把我排除在外，但我有一个护身符，可以对抗那些从事形式逻辑的人的巫术。在适当的时候我会透露它。更严重的是，由于语言习惯的持久性和强度，我注定会陷入许多陷阱，这些习惯与其说是我的，不如说是共同的种族遗产。当我写作时，我将把文字与事物等同起来，我将混淆抽象的层次，我将把绝对拟人化，我将处理各种文字魔法。尽管我可能会进行编辑和修改，但其中许多错误仍然会存在。但你将读到这样一本书，作者至少会警惕意义的失败，至少意识到沟通的严重困难。这是你每天都不会遇到的事情。毕竟，一个人必须从某个地方开始，而这就是我的开始。
I am going to tell you, as plainly as I can, what has been discovered about semantics so far; what heady, exciting stuff it is; what it has done for me personally in laying ghosts and sharpening meaning; and what it might do for men in general if enough of them could become acquainted with the discipline.
我将尽可能简单地告诉你迄今为止关于语义学的发现；这是多么令人兴奋、令人兴奋的事情啊！它对我个人在奠定幽灵和锐化意义方面做了什么？以及如果有足够多的人能够熟悉这门学科的话，它会对一般人产生什么影响。
Three human beings to my knowledge have observed and reflected upon the nature of meaning and communication for any considerable period. By “considerable period” I mean years and years of intensive effort. They are C. K. Ogden, I. A. Richards, and Alfred Korzybski. Each has given more than a dozen years of his life to the study. It is difficult, but perhaps no more so than investigating cosmic rays—which, to date, are without ascertained use to anybody. Offhand one would expect libraries full of books analyzing linguistic situations, and chairs of semantics in every university. Yet Richards said in 1936 that no respectable treatise on the theory of linguistic interpretation was in existence.1 There are few if any professional students or teachers of semantics. Even the theory of tennis or of football has been more thoroughly inquired into. So I have no accredited systematized body of knowledge to set before you, but rather the result of a series of raids into this laboratory and that. There is at least one virtue in this circumstance. No vested interest of learning can call me an upstart and an interloper, as has been my lot when venturing into more traveled fields.
据我所知，有三个人在相当长的时期内观察并反思了意义和交流的本质。我所说的“相当长的一段时间”是指年复一年的集中努力。他们是 CK Ogden、IA Richards 和 Alfred Korzybski。每个人都将自己十几年的生命奉献给了这项研究。这很困难，但也许并不比研究宇宙射线更困难——迄今为止，宇宙射线对任何人来说都没有确定的用途。随意的人会期望图书馆里装满分析语言情况的书籍，每所大学都有语义学教授。然而，理查兹在 1936 年表示，关于语言解释理论的值得尊敬的论文并不存在。1 语义学专业的学生或教师几乎没有。甚至网球或足球的理论也得到了更彻底的研究。因此，我没有向你们展示经过认可的系统化知识体系，而是对这个实验室和那个实验室进行一系列突袭的结果。在这种情况下至少有一种美德。学习的既得利益不能称我为暴发户和闯入者，就像我在冒险进入更多领域时所做的那样。
I shall frequently be caught in my own trap by using bad language in a plea for better. True. But do not mistake metaphor and simile for bad language. As we shall see, meaning implies a check back, a reference, to the hearer’s experience in the world outside. If a metaphor widens the base of the reference—which is its intention—communication may be improved. In the words of Doctor Johnson, the hearer gets two chances of meaning for one—or 100 per cent on his money. The last phrase is of course a metaphor, and an example of what I had in mind.
我经常会因为用脏话祈求更好而陷入自己的陷阱。真的。但不要将隐喻和明喻误认为是脏话。正如我们将看到的，意义意味着对听者在外部世界的体验的回溯和参考。如果隐喻扩大了指代的基础（这就是它的意图），那么沟通可能会得到改善。用约翰逊博士的话说，听者有两次机会表达自己的意思，或者说 100% 花在他的钱上。最后一句话当然是一个比喻，也是我的想法的一个例子。
This is not an easy book to write. Perhaps it will give you an idea of how to write a better one. The field is wide open, and cultivators are badly needed.
这不是一本容易写的书。也许它会让您了解如何写出更好的文章。田野广阔，急需耕耘者。
Chapter II
第二章
A LOOK AROUND THE MODERN WORLD
环顾现代世界
BEFORE attacking the fundamentals of semantics, let us take a brief survey of some effects of bad language in the contemporary scene.
在探讨语义学的基本原理之前，让我们先简要回顾一下不良语言在当代场景中的一些影响。
If original sin is an assumption without meaning (and I am afraid Dr. Bridgman would be unable to find an operation to validate it); if people as one meets them—Mr. Brown and Mrs. Smith—are, in overwhelming proportions, kindly and peaceful folk, and so I find them; and if the human brain is an instrument of remarkable power and capacity—as the physiologists assure us—there must be some reason, some untoward crossing of wires, at the bottom of our inability to order our lives more happily and to adapt ourselves and our actions to our environment.
如果原罪是一个没有意义的假设（恐怕布里奇曼博士将无法找到手术来验证它）；如果人们作为一个人遇见他们——先生。布朗和史密斯夫人——绝大多数都是善良、平和的人，所以我发现他们是这样的人。如果人类的大脑是一个具有非凡力量和能力的工具——正如生理学家向我们保证的那样——那么在我们无法更快乐地安排我们的生活以及适应我们自己和我们的生活的根本原因中，一定有某种原因，一些不愉快的交叉。对我们的环境采取行动。
Nobody in his senses wants airplanes dropping bombs and poison gases upon his head; nobody in his senses wants slums, Tobacco Roads, and undernourished, ragged schoolchildren in a land of potential economic plenty. But bombs are killing babies in China and Spain today, and more than one-third of the people in America are underfed, badly housed, shoddily clothed. Nobody wants men and women to be unemployed, but in Western civilization from twenty to thirty million are, or have recently been, without work, and many of those who have recovered their jobs are making munitions of war. In brief, with a dreadful irony, we are acting to produce precisely the kinds of things and situations which we do not want. It is as though a hungry farmer, with rich soil, and good wheat seed in his barn, could raise nothing but thistles. The tendency of organisms is strongly toward survival, not against it. Something has perverted human-survival behavior. I assume that it is a temporary perversion. I assume that it is bound up to some extent with an unconscious misuse of man’s most human attributes-thinking and its tool, language.
任何有理智的人都不希望飞机向他的头上投下炸弹和毒气。没有一个有理智的人愿意在一片经济潜力充裕的土地上看到贫民窟、烟草路和营养不良、衣衫褴褛的学童。但今天，炸弹正在中国和西班牙杀死婴儿，而超过三分之一的美国人吃不饱、住房条件差、衣着劣质。没有人希望男人和女人失业，但在西方文明中，有二十到三千万人现在或最近已经失业，而许多恢复工作的人正在制造战争弹药。简而言之，具有可怕的讽刺意味的是，我们的行为恰恰是为了制造我们不想要的事物和情况。就好像一个饥饿的农民，拥有肥沃的土壤，谷仓里有优质的小麦种子，却只能种植蓟。生物体的倾向是强烈地倾向于生存，而不是反对生存。有些东西扭曲了人类的生存行为。我认为这是暂时的变态。我认为这在某种程度上与人们无意识地滥用人类最具人性的属性——思维及其工具——语言有关。
Failure of mental communication is painfully in evidence nearly everywhere we choose to look. Pick up any magazine or newspaper and you will find many of the articles devoted to sound and fury from politicians, editors, leaders of industry, and diplomats. You will find the text of the advertising sections devoted almost solidly to a skillful attempt to make words mean something different to the reader from what the facts warrant. Most of us are aware of the chronic inability of schoolchildren to understand what is taught them; their examination papers are familiar exhibits in communication failure. Let me put a question to my fellow authors in the fields of economics, politics, and sociology: How many book-reviewers show by their reviews that they know what you are talking about? One in ten? That is about my ratio. Yet most of them assert that I am relatively lucid, if ignorant. How many arguments arrive anywhere? “A controversy,” says Richards, “is normally an exploitation of a set of misunderstandings for warlike purposes.” Have you ever listened to a debate in the Senate? A case being argued before the Supreme Court? . . . This is not frail humanity strapped upon an eternal rack. This is a reparable defect in the mechanism. When the physicists began to clear up their language, especially after Einstein, one mighty citadel after another was taken in the quest for knowledge. Is slum clearance a more difficult study than counting electrons? Strictly speaking, this may be a meaningless question, but I think you get my point.
心理沟通的失败几乎随处可见，令人痛苦。拿起任何一本杂志或报纸，你都会发现许多来自政治家、编辑、行业领袖和外交官的专门讨论声音和愤怒的文章。你会发现广告部分的文字几乎完全致力于巧妙地尝试使文字对读者来说意味着与事实所保证的不同的东西。我们大多数人都意识到学童长期无法理解所教的内容；他们的试卷是沟通失败的常见表现。让我向经济学、政治学和社会学领域的同行作者提出一个问题：有多少书评家通过他们的评论表明他们知道你在说什么？十分之一？这就是我的比例。然而他们中的大多数人声称我虽然无知，但还是相对清醒的。有多少参数到达任何地方？理查兹说：“争议通常是为了战争目的而利用一系列误解。”你听过参议院的辩论吗？最高法院正在审理的案件？ 。 。 。这并不是将脆弱的人性绑在永恒的架子上。这是该机制中可修复的缺陷。当物理学家开始清理他们的语言时，尤其是在爱因斯坦之后，一座又一座强大的城堡被占领以寻求知识。贫民窟清理是比电子计数更困难的研究吗？严格来说，这可能是一个毫无意义的问题，但我想你明白我的意思了。
It is too late to eliminate the factor of sheer verbalism in the already blazing war between “fascism” and “communism.” That war may end Europe as a viable continent for decades. To say that it is a battle of words alone is contrary to the facts, for there are important differences between the so-called fascist and communist states. But the words themselves, and the dialectic which accompanies them, have kindled emotional fires which far transcend the differences in fact. Abstract terms are personified to become burning, fighting realities. Yet if the knowledge of semantics were general, and men were on guard for communication failure, the conflagration could hardly start. There would be honest differences of opinion, there might be a sharp political struggle, but not this windy clash of rival metaphysical notions.
在“法西斯主义”和“共产主义”之间已经很激烈的战争中，要消除纯粹的口头主义因素已经太晚了。这场战争可能会导致欧洲在几十年内不再是一个可以生存的大陆。如果说这只是一场口水战，那是与事实相反的，因为所谓的法西斯国家和共产主义国家之间存在着重要的区别。但这些词语本身，以及伴随它们的辩证法，已经点燃了远远超越事实差异的情感之火。抽象术语被拟人化，成为燃烧的、战斗的现实。然而，如果语义知识很普遍，并且人们对沟通失败保持警惕，那么大火就很难爆发。可能会有诚实的意见分歧，可能会有激烈的政治斗争，但不会是形而上学观念之间激烈的冲突。
If one is attacked and cornered, one fights; the reaction is shared with other animals and is a sound survival mechanism. In modern times, however, this natural action comes after the conflict has been set in motion by propaganda. Bad language is now the mightiest weapon in the arsenal of despots and demagogues. Witness Dr. Goebbels. Indeed, it is doubtful if a people learned in semantics would tolerate any son of supreme political dictator. Ukases would be met with a flat “No comprendo” or with roars of laughter. A typical speech by an aspiring Hitler would be translated into its intrinsic meaning, if any. Abstract words and phrases without discoverable referents would register a semantic blank, noises without meaning. For instance:
如果一个人受到攻击并被逼入绝境，一个人就会战斗；这种反应与其他动物相同，是一种健全的生存机制。然而，在现代，这种自然行动是在宣传引发冲突之后发生的。现在，脏话是暴君和煽动者武器库中最强大的武器。戈培尔博士就是见证。事实上，一个精通语义学的民族是否会容忍最高政治独裁者的儿子是值得怀疑的。乌卡塞斯会听到一声平淡的“不理解”或一阵大笑。有抱负的希特勒的典型演讲将被翻译成其内在含义（如果有的话）。没有可发现的指称的抽象单词和短语会出现语义空白，毫无意义的噪音。例如：
The Aryan Fatherland, which has nursed the souls of heroes, calls upon you for the supreme sacrifice which you, in whom flows heroic blood, will not fail, and which will echo forever down the corridors of history.
孕育了英雄灵魂的雅利安祖国呼唤你们做出至高无上的牺牲，你们身上流淌着英雄的鲜血，你们不会失败，这将在历史的长廊中永远回响。
This would be translated:
这将被翻译为：
The blab blab, which has nursed the blabs of blabs, calls upon you for the blab blab which you, in whom flows blab blood, will not fail, and which will echo blab down the blabs of blab.
喋喋不休，孕育了喋喋不休的喋喋不休，呼唤着你，流淌着喋喋不休的血液的你，将不会失败，并且它将回响喋喋不休的喋喋不休。
The “blab” is not an attempt to be funny; it is a semantic blank. Nothing comes through. The hearer, versed in reducing high-order abstractions to either nil or a series of roughly similar events in the real world of experience, and protected from emotive associations with such words, simply hears nothing comprehensible. The demagogue might as well have used Sanskrit.
“闲聊”并不是为了搞笑，而是为了搞笑。这是一个语义空白。什么也没有通过。听者擅长将高阶抽象简化为零或现实经验世界中一系列大致相似的事件，并且不会与这些词语产生情感联系，因此他们根本听不到任何可理解的东西。煽动者也可能使用梵文。
If, however, a political leader says:
然而，如果一位政治领袖说：
Every adult in the geographical area called Germany will receive not more than two loaves of bread per week for the next six months,
在接下来的六个月里，德国地理区域的每个成年人每周收到的面包不会超过两条，
there is little possibility of communication failure. There is not a blab in a carload of such talk. If popular action is taken, it will be on the facts. This statement is susceptible to Dr. Bridgman’s operational approach.
通讯失败的可能性很小。这样的谈话没有一句废话。如果民众采取行动，那就是基于事实。这种说法很容易受到布里奇曼博士的操作方法的影响。
Endless political and economic difficulties in America have arisen and thriven on bad language. The Supreme Court crisis of 1937 was due chiefly to the creation by judges and lawyers of verbal monsters in the interpretation of the Constitution. They gave objective, rigid values to vague phrases like “due process” and “interstate commerce.” Once these monsters get into the zoo, no one knows how to get them out again, and they proceed to eat us out of house and home.
美国无休无止的政治和经济困难都是因脏话而产生和发展的。 1937 年最高法院危机的主要原因是法官和律师在宪法解释中制造了语言怪物。他们赋予“正当程序”和“州际贸易”等模糊短语以客观、严格的价值观。一旦这些怪物进入动物园，就没有人知道如何将它们救出来，它们就会开始把我们吃掉。
Judges and lawyers furthermore have granted to a legal abstraction the rights, privileges, and protection vouchsafed to a living, breathing human being. It is thus that corporations, as well as you or I, are entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It would surely be a rollicking sight to see the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in pursuit of happiness at a dance hall. It would be a sight to see United States Smelting and Refining being brought back to consciousness by a squad of coastguardmen armed with a respirator, to see the Atlas Corporation enjoying its constitutional freedom at a nudist camp. This gross animism has permitted a relatively small number of individuals to throw the economic mechanism seriously out of gear. By economic mechanism, I mean the operation of factories, stores, machines, whereby men, women, and children are fed, sheltered, and clothed. If people were armed with semantic understanding, such fabulous concepts could not arise. Corporations would not be interpreted as tender persons.
此外，法官和律师还赋予法律抽象以活生生的人类所享有的权利、特权和保护。因此，企业以及你我都有权享有生命、自由和追求幸福。看到新泽西标准石油公司在舞厅里追求幸福，一定会是一番热闹的景象。看到美国冶炼和炼油厂被一队戴着呼吸器的海岸警卫队恢复意识，看到阿特拉斯公司在裸体主义者营地享受宪法自由，这将是一个景象。这种粗暴的万物有灵论使得相对少数的人使经济机制严重失灵。我所说的经济机制，是指工厂、商店、机器的运作，男人、女人和孩子借此获得食物、住所和衣服。如果人们具备语义理解能力，那么这些神话般的概念就不会出现。公司不会被解释为投标人。
Corporations fill but one cage in a large menagerie. Let us glance at some of the other queer creatures created by personifying abstractions in America. Here in the center is a vast figure called the Nation-majestic and wrapped in the Flag. When it sternly raises its arm, we are ready to die for it. Close behind rears a sinister shape, the Government. Following it is one even more sinister, Bureaucracy. Both are festooned with the writhing serpents of Red Tape. High in the heavens is the Constitution, a kind of chalice like the Holy Grail, suffused with ethereal light. It must never be joggled. Below floats the Supreme Court, a black-robed priesthood tending the eternal fire. The Supreme Court must be addressed with respect or it will neglect the fire and the Constitution will go out. This is synonymous with the end of the world. Somewhere above the Rocky Mountains are lodged the vast stone tablets of the Law. We are governed not by men but by these tablets. Near them, in satin breeches and silver buckles, pose the stem figures of our Forefathers, contemplating glumly the Nation they brought to birth. The onion-shaped demon cowering behind the Constitution is Private Property. Higher than Court, Flag, or the Law, close to the sun itself and almost as bright, is Progress, the ultimate God of America.
公司只占据了一个大动物园中的一个笼子。让我们看一下美国其他一些通过拟人化抽象概念创造出来的酷儿生物。中心是一个巨大的人物，被称为“国家雄伟”，包裹在旗帜中。当它严厉地举起手臂时，我们就准备好为它而死。紧随其后的是一个邪恶的人物，那就是政府。其次是更险恶的官僚主义。两者都装饰着繁文缛节中扭动的蛇。高高在上的宪法，是一种如同圣杯的圣杯，散发着空灵的光芒。切勿将其摇动。下面漂浮着最高法院，一个身着黑袍的祭司正在照管永恒之火。最高法院必须受到尊重，否则它将忽视这场大火，宪法就会熄灭。这就是世界末日的代名词。落基山脉上方的某个地方矗立着巨大的法律石碑。我们不是由人统治，而是由这些石板统治。在他们旁边，我们的先祖们穿着缎子马裤，戴着银扣，摆着雕像，闷闷不乐地凝视着他们所孕育的国家。宪法背后的洋葱形恶魔是私有财产。进步是美国的终极之神，比法庭、旗帜或法律更高，接近太阳本身，几乎同样明亮。
Looming along the coasts are two horrid monsters, with scaly paws outstretched: Fascism and Communism. Confronting them, shield in hand and a little cross-eyed from trying to watch both at once, is the colossal figure of Democracy. Will he fend them off? We wring our hands in supplication, while admonishing the young that governments, especially democratic governments, are incapable of sensible action. From Atlantic to Pacific a huge, corpulent shape entitled Business pursues a slim, elusive Confidence, with a singular lack of success. The little trembling ghost down in the corner of Massachusetts, enclosed in a barrel, is the Taxpayer. Liberty, in diaphanous draperies, leaps from cloud to cloud, lovely and unapproachable.
沿着海岸隐约可见两个可怕的怪物，它们伸出了鳞状的爪子：法西斯主义和共产主义。面对他们的是民主的巨大人物，他手握盾牌，由于试图同时观看两者而有点斗鸡眼。他会抵挡他们吗？我们绞尽脑汁哀求，同时告诫年轻人，政府，特别是民主政府，没有能力采取明智的行动。从大西洋到太平洋，一个名为“商业”的巨大而肥胖的形状追求一种薄弱的、难以捉摸的信心，但却缺乏成功。马萨诸塞州角落里那个颤抖的小幽灵，被关在一个桶里，就是纳税人。自由女神披着透明的帷幔，从一朵云跳跃到另一朵云，可爱又难以接近。
Here are the Masses, thick, black, and squirming. This demon must be firmly sat upon; if it gets up, terrible things will happen; the Constitution may be joggled—anything. In the summer of 1937, Mr. John L. Lewis was held to be stirring up the Masses; and the fear and horror of our best people knew no bounds. Capital, her skirts above her knees, is preparing to leave the country at the drop of a hairpin, but never departs. Skulking from city to city goes Crime, a red, loathsome beast, upon which the Law is forever trying to drop a monolith, but its aim is poor. Crime continues rhythmically to Rear Its Ugly Head. Here is the dual shape of Labor—for some a vast, dirty, clutching hand, for others a Galahad in armor. Pacing to and fro with remorseless tread are the Trusts and the Utilities, bloated, unclean monsters with enormous biceps. Here is Wall Street, a crouching dragon ready to spring upon assets not already nailed down in any other section of the country. The Consumer, a pathetic figure in a gray shawl, goes wearily to market. Capital and Labor each give her a kick as she passes, while Commercial Advertising, a playful sprite, squirts perfume into her eyes.
这是肿块，又厚又黑，还在蠕动。这个恶魔必须被牢牢地踩在脚下；如果它起来，可怕的事情就会发生；宪法可能会发生混乱——任何事情。 1937 年夏天，约翰·路易斯 (John L. Lewis) 先生被认为煽动群众。我们最优秀的人民的恐惧和恐惧是无止境的。资本，她的裙子长及膝盖，正准备在发夹下的瞬间离开这个国家，但从未离开。犯罪，一只红色的、令人厌恶的野兽，从一个城市潜伏到另一个城市，法律永远试图在它身上扔下一块巨石，但它的目标很差。犯罪活动有节奏地持续到“抬起丑陋的头”。这是工党的双重形象——对一些人来说是一只巨大、肮脏、紧握的手，对另一些人来说则是穿着盔甲的加拉哈德。信托公司和公用事业公司无情地来回踱步，它们是臃肿、肮脏的怪物，有着巨大的二头肌。这里是华尔街，一条蹲伏的巨龙，随时准备扑向美国其他地区尚未固定的资产。消费者是一个披着灰色围巾的可怜人物，疲惫地走向市场。资方和工方在她经过时各自踢了她一脚，商业广告这个顽皮的精灵则把香水喷到她的眼睛里。
From the rear, Sex is a foul creature but when she turns, she becomes wildly alluring. Here is the Home, a bright fireplace in the stratosphere. The Economic Man strolls up and down, completely without vertebrae. He is followed by a shambling demon called the Law of Supply and Demand. Production, a giant with lightning in his fist, parades reluctantly with Distribution, a thin, gaunt girl, given to fainting spells. Above the oceans the golden scales of a Favorable Balance of Trade occasionally glitter in the sun. When people see the glitter, they throw their hats into the air. That column of smoke, ten miles high, looping like a hoop snake, is the Business Cycle. That clanking goblin, all gears and switchboards, is Technological Unemployment. The Rich, in full evening regalia, sit at a loaded banquet table, which they may never leave, gorging themselves forever amid the crystal and silver. . . .
从后面看，性是一个肮脏的生物，但当她转身时，她变得异常迷人。这里是家，平流层中的一个明亮的壁炉。经济人走来走去，完全没有脊椎骨。跟随他的是一个步履蹒跚的恶魔，称为供求法则。生产，一个拳头握着闪电的巨人，不情愿地与分布，一个瘦弱、憔悴的女孩，经常昏倒的女孩一起游行。在海洋之上，贸易顺差的金色鳞片偶尔会在阳光下闪闪发光。当人们看到闪光时，他们将帽子抛向空中。那股十英里高、像蛇一样盘旋的烟柱就是经济周期。那个叮当作响的妖精，所有的齿轮和配电盘，就是技术失业。富人们穿着全套晚装，坐在一张摆满食物的宴会桌前，他们可能永远不会离开这张桌子，永远在水晶和银器中狼吞虎咽。 。 。 。
Such, gentlemen, is the sort of world which our use of language fashions.
先生们，这就是我们使用语言塑造的世界。
The United States has no monopoly on menageries of this nature. Kingsley Martin, New Statesman editor, has recently devoted a book to the Crown, greatest spook in the demonology of the British Empire.1 As Clifton Fadiman said, the book is a careful study in contemporary fetishism, tracing the growth and pointing out the dangers of that totem-and-taboo culture which has been substituted in the British Isles for the rites of the Druids and painting the body blue. Mr. Martín questions whether the labors of the shamans and witch doctors in creating the perfect “father image” have not been a little overdone. It will be hard now to build the new King into a god after the scandalously human behavior of Edward VIII.
美国并不垄断这种性质的动物园。 《新政治家》编辑金斯利·马丁最近专门写了一本书，讲述大英帝国恶魔学中最大的幽灵——王室。 正如克利夫顿·法迪曼所说，这本书是对当代拜物教的仔细研究，追踪了拜物教的发展并指出了其危险。这种图腾和禁忌文化在不列颠群岛已经取代了德鲁伊的仪式，并将身体涂成蓝色。马丁先生质疑萨满和巫医在创造完美“父亲形象”方面的努力是否有点过头了。在爱德华八世的可耻人类行为之后，现在很难将新国王塑造成神。
Handicraft communities could handle language without too seriously endangering their survival. They tortured and sometimes killed poor old ladies as “witches.” They reduced their own efficiency in acquiring the necessities of life by elaborate rituals and superstitions. But while language was a handicap, it was not a major menace. There was not much reading or writing. Plenty of firsthand experience acted as a check on unprovable statements.
手工艺社区可以处理语言，而不会严重危及他们的生存。他们把可怜的老太太当作“女巫”来折磨，有时甚至杀害。他们通过繁琐的仪式和迷信降低了自己获取生活必需品的效率。虽然语言是一个障碍，但它并不是一个重大威胁。没有太多的阅读或写作。大量的第一手经验可以作为对无法证实的陈述的检验。
Power Age communities have grown far beyond the check of individual experience. They rely increasingly on printed matter, radio, communication at a distance. This has operated to enlarge the field for words, absolutely and relatively, and has created a paradise for fakirs. A community of semantic illiterates, of persons unable to perceive the meaning of what they read and hear, is one of perilous equilibrium. Advertisers, as well as demagogues, thrive on this illiteracy. The case against the advertising of commercial products has hitherto rested on mendacity. In modern times outright mendacity—such as a cure for cancer—is tempered with spurious identification. The advertiser often creates verbal goods, turning the reader’s attention away from the actual product. He sells the package, and especially the doctrinal matter around the package. The plain woman, by using a given cosmetic, is invited to become Cleopatra, vested with all the allure of the East. In brief, consumers often pay their money for the word rather than for the thing.
电力时代社区的发展已经远远超出了个人经验的范围。他们越来越依赖印刷品、无线电和远距离通信。这绝对地和相对地扩大了文字的领域，并为托钵僧创造了一个天堂。一个由语义文盲组成的社区，人们无法理解他们所读到和听到的内容的含义，这是一种危险的平衡。广告商和煽动者都靠这种文盲而繁荣。迄今为止，针对商业产品广告的诉讼一直以谎言为依据。在现代，彻头彻尾的谎言——比如治疗癌症——被虚假的身份所调和。广告商经常创造口头商品，将读者的注意力从实际产品上转移开。他出售整套方案，尤其是围绕整套方案的教义内容。朴素的女人，通过使用特定的化妆品，被邀请成为克利奥帕特拉，赋予东方的所有魅力。简而言之，消费者常常为“字”而不是“物”付钱。
Without ability to translate words into verifiable meanings, most people are the inevitable victims of both commercial and literary fraud. Their mental life is increasingly corrupted. Unlettered peasants have more sales resistance, and frequently more sense. Foreign traders in Mexico complain bitterly of the “damned wantlessness” of the Indians. The Indians are a handicraft people, and take meaning more from doing than from talking.
由于无法将文字翻译成可验证的含义，大多数人不可避免地成为商业和文学欺诈的受害者。他们的精神生活日益败坏。没有受过教育的农民有更多的销售阻力，而且往往更有理智。墨西哥的外国商人强烈抱怨印第安人“该死的无欲无求”。印度人是一个手工艺民族，他们从行动中获得的意义比从空谈中获得的意义更大。
One wonders if modern methods of mass education promote as much knowledge in children’s minds as they do confusion. Certainly in Germany, Italy, and Russia today the attempt is being made to bind the minds of children as once the feet of Chinese gentlewomen were bound. Millions of mental cripples may result. “The outside world,” remarks Korzybski, “is full of devastating energies, and an organism may only be called adapted to life when it not only receives stimuli but also has protective means against stimuli.” Without knowledge of the correct use of words most of us are defenseless against harmful stimuli. Those who deliberately teach people to fly from reality through cults, mythologies, and dogmas are helping them to be unsane, to deal with phantoms, to create dream states.
人们想知道，现代大众教育方法是否在儿童头脑中促进了与困惑一样多的知识。当然，今天的德国、意大利和俄罗斯正试图束缚孩子们的心灵，就像曾经束缚中国淑女的双脚一样。可能会导致数百万人精神瘫痪。科尔兹布斯基评论说：“外部世界充满了毁灭性的能量，只有当一个有机体不仅接受刺激，而且还具有抵御刺激的保护手段时，才可以被称为适应生命。”如果不知道如何正确使用词语，我们大多数人都无法抵御有害刺激。那些故意通过邪教、神话和教条教导人们逃离现实的人正在帮助他们变得疯狂，应对幻影，创造梦想状态。
Fortunately there is nothing seriously the matter with our natural mental equipment. It might be improved, but the normal human brain, to quote Korzybski, has the possibility of making at least ten (10) with 2,783,000 zeros after it, different connections between nerve cells. There is no name in arithmetic for such a number. It is greater than the number of molecules in the universe, greater than the number of seconds which the sun has existed. With such a switchboard, the human brain ought to suffice for ordinary working purposes.
幸运的是，我们的自然心理设备并没有什么严重的问题。它可能会得到改善，但引用 Korzybski 的话，正常人脑有可能在神经细胞之间建立至少十 (10) 个后面有 2,783,000 个零的不同连接。这样的数字在算术中没有名称。它比宇宙中分子的数量还要多，比太阳存在的秒数还要多。有了这样的总机，人脑应该足以满足普通的工作目的。
People are not “dumb” because they lack mental equipment; they are dumb because they lack an adequate method for the use of that equipment. Those intellectuals whose pastime is to sit on high fences and deplore the innate stupidity of the herd are on a very shaky fence. Often, if they but knew it, they are more confused than the man on the street, for they deal in loftier abstractions. When I hear a man say, “We never can get anywhere because the masses are so stupid,” I know that I am in the presence of a mythmaker, caught on his high perch behind the bars of a verbal prison.
人之所以“愚”，并不是因为他们缺乏精神装备，而是因为他们缺乏精神装备。他们很愚蠢，因为他们缺乏使用该设备的适当方法。那些以坐在高高的栅栏上并谴责大众与生俱来的愚蠢为消遣的知识分子，他们的栅栏非常摇摇欲坠。通常，即使他们知道这一点，他们也比街上的人更困惑，因为他们处理的是更崇高的抽象概念。当我听到一个人说：“我们永远无法取得任何进展，因为大众太愚蠢了。”我知道我面前的是一个神话制造者，他被困在言语监狱的铁窗后面。

第三章
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE
内在和外在
THINKING creatures are forced to make a sharp distinction between the happenings inside their skins and those without. Inside is the “me,” outside is “the world.” The “me” is unique, individual, different from every other “me.” No two ladybugs, or even amoebas, show identical characteristics. The chief business of the “me” is to come to terms with the world, reproduce its kind, and live as long and as comfortably as possible. No operations have yet been performed, or perhaps will ever be, which show “me’s” elsewhere than in living bodies, behaving in a living world. C. M. Child says:
会思考的生物被迫区分皮肤内部和外部发生的事情。里面是“我”，外面是“世界”。 “我”是独特的、个体的，与其他“我”不同。没有两只瓢虫，甚至变形虫，表现出相同的特征。 “我”的主要任务是与世界达成协议，繁衍同类，并尽可能长寿和舒适地生活。目前还没有，或者可能永远不会进行任何手术来显示“我”除了在活生生的身体中、在活生生的世界中表现之外的其他地方。 CM 儿童 说：
The organism is inexplicable without environment. Every characteristic of it has some relation to environmental factors. And particularly the organism-as-a-whole, i.e. the unity and order, the physiological differences, relations and harmonies between its parts, are entirely meaningless except in relation to an external world.
没有环境，有机体是无法解释的。它的每一个特性都与环境因素有一定的关系。特别是有机体作为一个整体，即其各部分之间的统一和秩序、生理差异、关系和和谐，除非与外部世界相关，否则完全没有意义。
The environment beyond the “me” may be described on three levels: the macroscopic or normal, which we see with our eyes and touch with our hands; the microscopic, which we can peer into with instruments; and the submicroscopic, which we do not consciously see or feel, but can deduce with the relations established primarily by mathematics. Before the first microscope was invented, no human being had knowledge of minute so phenomena, and before atoms were indicated, there was no verifiable concept of the submicroscopic world—although guesses, largely inaccurate, were made about atoms as far back as the ancient Greeks. For the overwhelming proportion of his history man has dealt with his environment only on the macroscopic or normal level. The thing called a stone was recognized as such, and not as a mad dance of atoms. Only lately have we learned that we are immersed in a vast sea of energy manifestations called the “plenum,” out of which we abstract a few for everyday use. Scientific knowledge at the present time, to quote Korzybski, indicates that ordinary material objects represent
“我”之外的环境可以从三个层面来描述：宏观的或正常的，我们用眼睛看到、用手触摸的；微观的，我们可以用仪器观察；以及亚微观，我们没有有意识地看到或感觉到，但可以通过主要由数学建立的关系来推断。在第一台显微镜发明之前，没有人对微小的现象有了解，在原子被指出之前，还没有可验证的亚微观世界的概念——尽管早在古希腊人就对原子做出了大部分不准确的猜测。在人类的历史中，绝大多数人只是在宏观或正常的层面上处理他的环境。被称为石头的东西被认为是这样的，而不是原子的疯狂舞蹈。直到最近我们才知道，我们正沉浸在被称为“全压室”的巨大能量表现海洋中，我们从中提取一些日常使用的能量。引用科日布斯基的话说，目前的科学知识表明，普通的物质对象代表了
extremely rare and very complex cases of the beknottedness of the plenum; that “life” represents extremely rare and very complex special cases of the material world; and, finally, that “intelligent life” represents increasingly complex and still more rare special cases of “life.”
非常罕见和非常复杂的全室打结情况； “生命”代表了物质世界中极其罕见和非常复杂的特殊情况；最后，“智能生命”代表了“生命”中日益复杂且更加罕见的特殊情况。
The scientific materialist of the nineteenth century is as homeless as a classical philosopher in this post-Einsteinian world.
十九世纪的科学唯物主义者和后爱因斯坦时代的古典哲学家一样无家可归。
A rough parallel of these three levels in human terms may be drawn as follows:
从人类的角度来看，这三个层次的大致相似之处可以画如下：
Macroscopic: Persons as seen by each other in daily life.
宏观：日常生活中彼此看到的人。
Microscopic: Persons and their lights and livers as seen by physicians, clinical technicians, and other scientists. Laymen are beginning to be aware of this level. They know that many diseases, such as typhoid fever, are spread by microscopic organisms, and have learned to take precautions against them.
微观：医生、临床技术人员和其他科学家所看到的人及其灯光和肝脏。外行人开始意识到这个水平。他们知道许多疾病，例如伤寒，是通过微生物传播的，并且学会了采取预防措施。
Submicroscopic: Persons as space-time events, beyond the reach of the senses and of the most powerful microscope. There is some evidence that human thought is accompanied by electrochemical activity in the cortex, and so may be on this level.
亚微观：人作为时空事件，超出了感官和最强大的显微镜的范围。有一些证据表明，人类的思维伴随着皮层的电化学活动，因此可能在这个层面上。
Eddington calls our attention to two tables. The first is his ordinary writing-table, familiar to him on the normal level for many years. “It has extension; it is comparatively permanent; it is colored; above all, it is substantial.” On the microscopic level, it is safe to say that the grain of the wood and the metal of the handles would show some startling changes, but “substance” would remain.
爱丁顿让我们注意两张桌子。第一个是他的普通写字台，多年来他在正常水平上已经很熟悉了。 “它有延伸；它是相对永久的；它是彩色的；最重要的是，它是实质性的。”在微观层面上，可以肯定地说，木头的纹理和手柄的金属会出现一些惊人的变化，但“实质”仍然存在。
The other is his scientific table, down in the sub-microscopic realm.
另一个是他的科学台，位于亚微观领域。
It is a more recent acquaintance and I do not feel so familiar with it . . . It is part of a world which in more devious ways has forced itself upon my attention. My scientific table is mostly emptiness. Sparsely scattered in that emptiness are numerous electric charges rushing about with great speed; but their combined bulk amounts to less than a billionth of the bulk of the table itself. Notwithstanding its strange construction, it turns out to be an entirely efficient table. It supports my writing paper as satisfactorily as table number one; for when I lay a paper on it, the little electric particles with their headlong speed keep on hitting the underside, so that the paper is maintained in shuttlecock fashion at a nearly steady level. If I lean upon this table, I shall not go through; or, to be strictly accurate, the chance of my scientific elbow going through my scientific table is so excessively small that it can be neglected in practical life.2
这是一个新认识的人，我感觉不太熟悉。 。 。它是一个以更狡猾的方式强迫我注意的世界的一部分。我的科学桌子大部分都是空的。那虚空之中，稀疏地散布着无数的电荷，飞速的奔腾着。但它们的总体积还不到桌子本身体积的十亿分之一。尽管其结构很奇怪，但事实证明它是一张非常高效的桌子。它像表一一样令人满意地支持我的写作论文；因为当我在上面放一张纸时，微小的带电粒子会以极快的速度不断撞击底部，从而使纸以羽毛球的方式保持在几乎稳定的水平。如果我靠在这张桌子上，我就无法通过；或者，严格准确地说，我的科学肘部穿过我的科学表的机会非常小，以至于在实际生活中可以忽略不计。2
The physicist used to borrow all his basic raw material from the familiar world that eyes see and fingers grasp; he does so no longer. Many of his raw materials today are electrons, quanta, potentials, Hamiltonian functions, and he is careful to guard them from contamination by macroscopic concepts. In breaking down matter into electric charges, he has traveled far from the old solid writing-table. The concept of “substance” has lost its meaning. The trend of modern physics is to relinquish the traditional categories of things—the Greeks, you remember, would divide the universe into earth, air, water, fire—and to substitute a common back ground for all experience.
过去，物理学家从眼睛看到、手指抓握的熟悉世界中借用了所有基本原材料。他不再这样做了。如今，他的许多原材料是电子、量子、势能、哈密顿函数，他小心翼翼地保护它们免受宏观概念的污染。在将物质分解为电荷的过程中，他已经远离了老式的实心写字台。 “物质”这个概念已经失去了意义。现代物理学的趋势是放弃传统的事物分类——你记得，希腊人将宇宙划分为土、空气、水、火——并用一个共同的背景来代替所有的经验。
Whether we are studying a material object, a magnetic field, a geometrical figure or a duration of time, our scientific information is summed up in measures; neither the apparatus of measurement nor the mode of using it suggests that there is anything essentially different in these problems. The measures themselves afford no ground for a classification by categories.
无论我们是在研究物质、磁场、几何图形还是时间长度，我们的科学信息都是通过测量来总结的；无论是测量仪器还是使用测量仪器的方式都表明这些问题之间存在本质上的不同。这些措施本身并没有提供按类别分类的依据。
Thus Einstein linked space and time and matter together into one organic concept. He found, among other things, that the faster a body moved, the greater was its mass.
因此，爱因斯坦将空间、时间和物质联系在一起，形成一个有机的概念。他发现，除其他外，物体移动得越快，其质量就越大。
We must be careful to keep our concepts deal and remember which level we are on. At the normal level of everyday life, substances have plenty of practical meaning. You had better not try to crash your scientific elbow through a scientific table. You had better not refuse to dodge a flatiron because it can be described as electric charges in an encircling emptiness. To our senses, the chunk of iron is solid stuff. But in submicroscopic regions, the concept of “substance” gives way to a totally different concept, best expressed in the language of mathematics.
我们必须小心地保持我们的概念并记住我们处于哪个水平。在日常生活的正常水平上，物质具有很多实际意义。你最好不要试图让你的科学肘部撞到科学桌子上。你最好不要拒绝躲避熨斗，因为它可以被描述为周围虚空中的电荷。从我们的感觉来看，这块铁是固体。但在亚微观区域，“物质”的概念让位于一个完全不同的概念，最好用数学语言来表达。
There is a profound semantic lesson here. The meaning of an event is not something fixed and eternal, but shifts with the context or the operation which is being performed upon it. “Iron” means one thing to a blacksmith hammering a horseshoe and another thing to a physicist studying atomic structure. When an engineer builds a modern steel bridge, both concepts are useful.
这里有一个深刻的语义教训。事件的意义不是固定和永恒的，而是随着上下文或对其执行的操作而变化。 “铁”对于锤打马蹄铁的铁匠来说是一回事，而对于研究原子结构的物理学家来说则是另一回事。当工程师建造一座现代钢桥时，这两个概念都很有用。
Let us recapitulate the known relations between the “me” and the environment, for this relationship is at the heart of the problem of meaning and language. If we cast an inventory of that which is outside our skins, we note objects, forces, things, at three levels. In the sub-microscopic world we have evidence—verified by operations—of events, plenum, atoms, quantum activity, electrical phenomena. This world has taken no final, orderly shape, but many items on its inventory sheet have been verified, and more are being added every year. The inventory is good enough to make possible the electric icebox in your kitchen. In the microscopic world we note chromosomes, cells, bacteria. Some day perhaps the larger molecules may be subject to direct observation. In the normal world we find the immemorial objects of man’s attention—stars, sun, moon, clouds, water, earth, mountain and plain, trees and plants, rocks and metals, towns, houses, animals, insects, and human beings. Things like these and their relations and behavior are all that we find. The inventory contains no beings, no objects, corresponding to “justice,” “democracy,” “fascism,” “capitalism”—no principles or essences of any kind. Beyond our skins are only things—moving, still, vital and less vital, changing, behaving. The “capitalisms” and “principles” are created in our heads by language and by language are objectified. The most powerful microscope cannot find them.
让我们概括一下“我”与环境之间已知的关系，因为这种关系是意义和语言问题的核心。如果我们列出我们皮肤之外的事物的清单，我们会在三个层面上记录物体、力量、事物。在亚微观世界中，我们有事件、静压室、原子、量子活动、电现象的证据（通过操作验证）。这个世界还没有形成最终的、有序的形状，但其库存表上的许多项目已经过验证，并且每年都会添加更多项目。库存充足，足以让您的厨房配备电冰箱。在微观世界中，我们注意到染色体、细胞、细菌。也许有一天，较大的分子可能会受到直接观察。在正常的世界中，我们发现了人类自古以来关注的对象——星星、太阳、月亮、云彩、水、地球、山脉和平原、树木和植物、岩石和金属、城镇、房屋、动物、昆虫和人类。我们发现的就是这些东西以及它们的关系和行为。该清单不包含与“正义”、“民主”、“法西斯主义”、“资本主义”相对应的存在、任何物体——没有任何原则或本质。在我们的皮肤之外只有事物——移动的、静止的、有活力的和不那么有活力的、变化的、行为的。 “资本主义”和“原则”是通过语言在我们的头脑中创造出来的，并通过语言被客观化。最强大的显微镜也找不到它们。
Animals, lacking words, take their meanings from the inventory on the macroscopic level, and so far as we know do not deal in lofty abstractions. Does a horse know when he crosses the border from France into Germany? Men, like animals, must begin the learning process with the inventory. The concept “democracy” may have useful meaning in a given context with severely limited characteristics, but it has no fixed and absolute meaning. One can intelligently discuss political groups labeled “democracies” conducted in a given setting at a given place at a given time—how citizens, for instance, participated in the Athenian state or in the New England town meeting. But when one affirms categorically, “Democracy is” thus and so, here, there, and everywhere; or, “Free speech is” this and that, here, there, and everywhere, he enters Cloudcuckooland. If “iron” can slip from the category of “substance,” how much more easily can these higher and vaguer abstractions melt and disappear.
动物缺乏语言，只能从宏观层面上的清单中获取意义，而且据我们所知，它们并不涉及崇高的抽象概念。马知道自己什么时候从法国越过边境进入德国吗？人和动物一样，必须从清单开始学习过程。 “民主”这个概念在特定的背景下可能具有有用的含义，但其特征受到严重限制，但它没有固定和绝对的含义。人们可以明智地讨论在特定时间、特定地点进行的被贴上“民主”标签的政治团体——例如，公民如何参与雅典国家或新英格兰城镇会议。但是，当人们断然肯定“民主是”时，这里、那里、无处不在，“民主就是”。或者，“言论自由是”这个那个，在这里，那里，到处，他进入了Cloudcuckooland。如果“铁”可以脱离“物质”的范畴，那么这些更高、更模糊的抽象概念就更容易融化和消失。
Through their senses animals, including man, gradually come to understand for purposes of survival the grosser aspects of their environment. For man, more than twenty senses have been listed, although we continue to cling to the classic five. In addition to sight, smell, taste, touch, hearing, there are said to be, among others: a muscular sense, used for instance in judging weight by lifting an object; a temperature sense and a pain sense which differ from touch; an articular sense attendant upon the articulation of the joints of the body; a distance sense, especially developed in the blind, who judge with considerable accuracy how far away a thing is without seeing it (we all use this sense in the dark); a static sense by which equilibrium is aided. The receptors for the last-named are located in the canals of the inner ear. Disturbance of these receptors is what makes one seasick.
为了生存，动物（包括人类）通过它们的感官逐渐了解其环境的更宏观的方面。对于人类来说，已经列出了二十多种感官，尽管我们仍然坚持经典的五种。除了视觉、嗅觉、味觉、触觉、听觉之外，据说还有： 肌肉感觉，例如用于通过举起物体来判断重量；与触觉不同的温度觉和痛觉；伴随身体关节关节的关节感觉；距离感，尤其是在盲人中发展起来的，他们在没有看到物体的情况下相当准确地判断出物体有多远（我们都在黑暗中使用这种感觉）；有助于平衡的静态感觉。后者的感受器位于内耳的耳道中。这些受体的紊乱是导致晕船的原因。
The senses are clever, but they miss the greater part of what is going on. C. Judson Herrick has prepared a table in his Introduction to Neurology which indicates the alarming number of things of which our senses are unaware. The skin is sensitive to mechanical vibrations up to 1,552 per second, but beyond that point feels only a steady push. The ear is aware of sound traveling by wave lengths of 13 mm. up to 12,280 mm., but does not hear sounds below or above these limits. Some animals have a wider sound-range. The skin is aware of heat-waves only from .0008 mm. to .1 mm. long. The eye takes cognizance of light-waves from .0008 mm. to .0004 mm., but misses electric waves, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, gamma rays, and cosmic rays, running from wave lengths of .0004 mm. to .000,000,000,008 mm. A biologist tells me on a rough estimate that the eye sees about one-twelve-thousandth of what there is to see.
感官很聪明，但他们错过了正在发生的大部分事情。 C.贾德森·赫里克（C. Judson Herrick）在他的《神经病学导论》中准备了一张表格，其中指出了我们的感官没有意识到的事物数量惊人。皮肤对每秒高达 1,552 次的机械振动很敏感，但超过该点只会感觉到稳定的推力。耳朵能感知到波长为 13 毫米的声音。最大 12,280 毫米，但听不到低于或高于这些限制的声音。有些动物的声音范围更广。皮肤只能感知到 0.0008 毫米的热浪。至 0.1 毫米。长的。眼睛识别 0.0008 毫米以上的光波。至 0.0004 毫米，但错过了波长为 0.0004 毫米的电波、紫外线、X 射线、伽马射线和宇宙射线。至 0.000,000,000,008 毫米。一位生物学家告诉我，粗略估计，眼睛能看到的东西大约是能看到的东西的一万二分之一。
Photoelectric cells, sensitive to infrared rays to which the human eye is blind, are now used to protect bank vaults. The safe-cracker cannot see the light to which the cell is sensitive. When his body comes between the cell and the light source, the cell proceeds to put into action gongs, sirens, and automatic calls to police headquarters. A flashlight explodes, a camera takes his picture, while down from overhead comes a tear-gas bomb to render him helpless until the police arrive.
光电管对人眼看不见的红外线敏感，现在被用来保护银行金库。保险箱破解者看不到细胞敏感的光。当他的身体到达牢房和光源之间时，牢房就会发出锣声、警报声，并自动呼叫警察总部。手电筒爆炸，相机给他拍照，而一枚催泪瓦斯炸弹从头顶落下，让他束手无策，直到警察到来。
A toothed wheel spinning at increasing speeds presently gives the finger touching it the feeling no longer of teeth, but of a smooth rim. A bladed fan, above a certain speed of revolution, impresses the eye as a flat, continuous surface.
目前，以越来越快的速度旋转的齿轮给触摸它的手指带来的感觉不再是牙齿，而是光滑的轮缘。超过一定转速的叶片风扇给人的印象是平坦、连续的表面。
The senses of man do not know what this thing—this rock, this knife, this electric light—may be. But they have received a sign from the outside world and they abstract the event in functions hopefully suitable for the survival of the organism—the rock to be avoided by the canoe, the knife to kill the game, the electric light to show the road. To the thing which this sign indicates, human beings in due course give a name. But the name is not the thing. The thing is nameless and nonverbal.
人类的感官不知道这个东西——这块石头、这把刀、这盏电灯——可能是什么。但他们收到了来自外界的信号，并将事件抽象为希望适合有机体生存的函数——独木舟要避开岩石，杀死猎物的刀，指示道路的电灯。人类会在适当的时候给这个标志所指示的事物命名。但名字并不是问题的关键。这件事是无名的、非语言的。
Let us follow Korzybski in his analysis of an apple. At the submicroscopic level it can be described as a nonverbal, uneatable event in space-time. At the normal level, it becomes a nonverbal, eatable object. At the verbal level, it is labeled “apple,” and may be described by various characteristics—round, red, juicy, containing seeds, and so on. At a higher level of abstraction, we may class it as a fruit, higher still as a food. At this point, we are a long way from the event. The objective apple in December may be an appetizing thing. Not so in the following May, when it has become a brown and rotted splash. The “apple,” then, is obviously a process, and not a static object. Similarly, a “flatiron” is a process, but at any given temperature the time scale must be much longer to measure a substantial change.
让我们跟随科日布斯基对苹果的分析。在亚微观层面，它可以被描述为时空中的非语言、不可食用的事件。在正常水平上，它变成了一个非语言的、可食用的物体。在语言层面上，它被标记为“苹果”，并且可以用各种特征来描述——圆形、红色、多汁、含有种子等等。在更高的抽象层次上，我们可以将其归类为水果，更高层次上可以将其归类为食物。此时此刻，我们距离事件发生还很遥远。 12月客观的苹果可能是一件开胃的东西。但到了接下来的五月，情况就不同了，那时它已经变成了棕色腐烂的斑点。那么，“苹果”显然是一个过程，而不是一个静态的物体。类似地，“熨斗”是一个过程，但在任何给定温度下，时间尺度必须更长才能测量实质性变化。
Why is the object nonverbal? Korzybski describes an infuriating game he sometimes inflicts upon doubters of this statement. He begins with a short discussion on a serious subject. Then he goes on to ask the victim the meanings of the words employed. This proceeds merrily for about ten minutes with the usual defining of terms, but presently the victim finds himself going in circles—defining “space” by “length” and “length” by “space.” Any further pressure upon him results in lamentable nervous disturbances. He blushes, sweats, paces up and down, begins to mistrust his reason. This has happened to everyone on whom the wretched game has been tried.
为什么对象是非语言的？科日布斯基描述了他有时对这一说法的怀疑者进行的令人恼火的游戏。他首先就一个严肃的话题进行了简短的讨论。然后他继续询问受害者所用词语的含义。按照通常的术语定义，这一切愉快地进行了大约十分钟，但很快受害者发现自己陷入了原地踏步——用“长度”定义“空间”，用“空间”定义“长度”。对他的任何进一步的压力都会导致可悲的神经紊乱。他脸红了，出汗了，踱来踱去，开始怀疑自己的理智。每个尝试过这种可怜游戏的人都遇到过这种情况。
The cause is clear. The bottom has been reached; this is as far as the language mechanism goes. Below lie the meanings of undefined terms, which we somehow know but cannot tell: the nonverbal level, where one can point but cannot utter, the very threshold where the senses make contact with the outside world. This contact comes before language and cannot be spoken. The eye receives light-waves from the apple, but says nothing. This apple, any apple, any object or act, is on the nonverbal level. Here we see it as a cat sees it, quietly and without words.
原因很清楚。已经到达底部；就语言机制而言，这就是了。下面是未定义术语的含义，我们以某种方式知道但无法说出：非语言层面，人们可以指出但不能说出，这是感官与外部世界接触的门槛。这种接触发生在语言之前，并且不能说出来。眼睛接收到来自苹果的光波，但什么也没说。这个苹果，任何苹果，任何物体或行为，都是在非语言层面上的。在这里，我们看到它就像猫看到它一样，安静而无言。
A group of synonyms does not define an object. A careful description may help bring it into focus for the listener, but is not conclusive. Final identification is achieved only by pointing to the apple, touching it with the hand, seeing it with the eyes, tasting it with the mouth, and so recognizing it as nonverbal. Here is the base from which all our proud words rise—every last one of them—and to it they must constantly return and be refreshed. Failing this, they wander into regions where there are no apples, no objects, no acts, and so they become symbols for airy chunks of nothing at all. In these regions the listener cannot know what the speaker is talking about, however firmly he may nod his head. Example: “Philosophy is a faith that dares to reason. Prudence is a policy that dares to bargain. Pedagogy is an experiment that dares to conclude.”1 Find the apple in this thought for the day.
一组同义词并不定义一个对象。仔细的描述可能有助于让听众集中注意力，但并不是结论性的。最终的识别只能通过指向苹果、用手触摸、用眼睛看到、用嘴品尝来实现，从而以非语言方式识别它。这里是我们所有引以为傲的话语——每一句——的发源地，它们必须不断回归并焕然一新。如果做不到这一点，它们就会漫游到没有苹果、没有物体、没有行为的区域，因此它们就成为空无一物的象征。在这些区域中，听者无法知道说话者在说什么，无论他如何坚决地点头。例如：“哲学是一种敢于推理的信仰。审慎是敢于讨价还价的政策。教育学是一项敢于得出结论的实验。”1 在今天的想法中找到苹果。
Allen Upward plays another game with the same moral. He reaches for the dictionary to find a definition of the word “mind”:
艾伦·厄普德（Allen Upward）又玩了另一款具有相同寓意的游戏。他伸手去查字典，寻找“心灵”这个词的定义：
Mind. Thoughts, sentiments, intellectual capacity, etc.
头脑。思想、情感、智力等。
Then he turns to the definition of “thought.”
然后他转向“思想”的定义。
Thought. Operations of the mind; ideas; image formed in the mind.
想法。心灵的运作；想法；脑海中形成的形象。
Putting the two definitions together he gets:
将这两个定义放在一起，他得到：
Mind = thought = images formed in the images formed in the images formed in the images . . . a recurring decimal.
头脑=思想=在图像中形成的图像在图像中形成的图像。 。 。循环小数。
A man, says Upward, is teaching a boy the use of the bow. He leans over the boy from behind, grasping the boy’s hand in his and guiding him while the bow is drawn. No words need be spoken. The boy is “understanding” how to draw the bow.
向上说，一个男人正在教一个男孩使用弓。他从后面靠在男孩身上，握住男孩的手，在拉弓时引导他。无需多言。男孩正在“理解”如何拉弓。
The senses apprehend the bowstring or the apple and say nothing. How does the saying get in? That is a complicated story on which the neurologists are still at work. Roughly, on the testimony of present knowledge, the circuit is something like this: Messages from the outside world in the form of light-waves, soundwaves, tactual pressures, strike the nerve ends and start an impulse, probably electrochemical. The impulse speeds through the nerves toward the brain, but it may or may not reach the higher brain centers. It appears to be held for appropriate action in one of three regions: in the spinal cord and cerebellum, in the midbrain and thalamic region, in the cortex or higher brain. The lower nervous centers take care of simple stimulus and response matters, such as the eyewink and maintaining balance. The thalamus takes care of vivid, dynamic, and emotional matter calling for quick response with little reflection, such as hitting back if someone strikes you. Certain messages, however, especially and significantly in human beings, are passed into the cortex for reflection and appropriate action. This is what we call “thought.”
感官抓住弓弦或苹果，什么也没说。这句话是怎么进来的？这是一个复杂的故事，神经学家仍在研究中。粗略地说，根据现有知识的证明，电路是这样的：来自外界的信息以光波、声波、触觉压力的形式，冲击神经末梢并启动脉冲，可能是电化学的。冲动通过神经加速到达大脑，但它可能会也可能不会到达更高的大脑中心。它似乎在三个区域之一中发挥适当的作用：脊髓和小脑、中脑和丘脑区域、皮质或高级大脑。下层神经中枢负责简单的刺激和反应事务，例如眨眼和保持平衡。丘脑负责处理生动、动态和情绪化的事情，需要快速反应而不进行反思，例如如果有人打你，就进行反击。然而，某些信息，尤其是对人类来说意义重大的信息，会被传递到大脑皮层进行反思和采取适当的行动。这就是我们所说的“思想”。
The higher animals possess a cortex and can presumably indulge in reflection, and then, after a definite time lag, in action. The lower animals and insects operate more automatically on lower nerve centers. A rat has a cortex but does not overburden it. If you teach a rat to perform a simple trick and then remove his cortex surgically, the training is wholly lost. However, he can be retrained and will perform the trick almost as well as before. There is record of a boy born without a cortex. He died before he was four years old without showing any signs of intelligence, or even of hunger and thirst. The first year passed in profound stupor, the next two in constant crying.
高等动物拥有大脑皮层，大概可以沉迷于反思，然后在一定的时间间隔后开始行动。低等动物和昆虫对低等神经中枢的运作更加自动。老鼠有皮质，但不会使其负担过重。如果你教一只老鼠表演一个简单的技巧，然后通过手术切除它的皮质，那么训练就完全失败了。然而，他可以重新训练，并且几乎可以像以前一样表演这个技巧。有记录称男孩出生时没有皮质。他不到四岁就去世了，没有表现出任何智力迹象，甚至没有饥饿和口渴的迹象。第一年在严重的昏迷中度过，接下来的两年在不断的哭泣中度过。
It took millions of years of evolution to build the cortex from the simple nervous structure of the lower brain. Thinking requires little physical energy. Thinking hard, as contrasted with the mind at rest, increases measurable energy consumption by only 3 or 4 per cent. But the electrical activity of the brain is unremitting. If two metal electrodes are attached to different areas of the head, they can pick up the flow of electricity from an area of high potential to a lower one. This flow can then be plotted. For an average subject at rest with the eyes closed, the chart shows a rhythmic series of waves averaging ten to the second. Open your eyes. The even rhythm stops. Do a hard sum in mathematics. The curve becomes jagged. In sleep, in hypnosis, the waves change their pattern again. “The thing that impresses all investigators,” says G. W. Gray, “is the ceaseless continuity of brain activity.” Perhaps thousands or even millions of cells are discharging many times every second. Wave patterns vary from person to person, and it has been proposed that brain-wave charts would make a better source of identification than fingerprints. You cannot throw acid on your brain. Identical twins, however, have practically the same wave patterns.
从下脑的简单神经结构开始形成皮层需要数百万年的进化。思考需要很少的体力。与休息时相比，认真思考只会增加可测量的能量消耗 3% 或 4%。但大脑的电活动却是不间断的。如果两个金属电极连接到头部的不同区域，它们可以接收从高电势区域到低电势区域的电流。然后可以绘制该流程。对于闭着眼睛休息的普通受试者，该图表显示平均为 10 秒的一系列有节奏的波。张开你的眼睛。均匀的节奏停止了。做一道数学题。曲线变得锯齿状。在睡眠中，在催眠中，电波再次改变它们的模式。 GW Gray 说：“让所有研究人员印象深刻的是大脑活动的不间断连续性。”也许每秒有数千甚至数百万个电池进行多次放电。脑电波模式因人而异，有人提出脑电波图将成为比指纹更好的识别来源。你不能向你的大脑泼酸。然而，同卵双胞胎具有几乎相同的波形。
The chief difference between the brain of a man and the brain of an ape is not in apparatus but in association paths, which are more numerous and more complex in man. He has a more complicated switchboard. If these paths become seriously blocked, the man rapidly becomes less than human. The human nervous structure is cyclical, like the wiring system of a house, and has a natural direction, from sense organ to lower centers to subcortical layers to cortex, and return by various paths, first the sensation, the sign from the world without, then reflection. Some unbalanced persons reverse this order. To them, meaning comes first, sensation follows. They see things which are not there, hear things, feel pain, and produce symptoms of paralysis for no physical cause. Semantic blockage of any kind, according to Korzybski, tends to reversal of nerve currents. Altogether too many of us who consider ourselves normal are, by objectifying abstractions, seeing things which are not there. Are we crazy, then? Not hopelessly, but daft enough to be on the point of shattering a civilization.
人的大脑和猿的大脑之间的主要区别不在于设备，而在于联想路径，而人的大脑的数量更多且更复杂。他有一个更复杂的总机。如果这些道路被严重堵塞，这个人很快就会变得不像人。人类的神经结构是周期性的，就像房子的布线系统一样，有一个自然的方向，从感觉器官到较低的中心，到皮质下层，再到皮质，并通过各种路径返回，首先是感觉，来自外部世界的信号，然后反思。有些不平衡的人颠倒了这个顺序。对他们来说，意义是第一位的，感觉其次。他们看到不存在的东西、听到东西、感到疼痛、无缘无故地产生瘫痪症状。科尔兹布斯基认为，任何形式的语义阻塞都会导致神经电流逆转。总的来说，我们中有太多自认为正常的人，通过将抽象事物具体化，看到了不存在的事物。那我们疯了吗？并非绝望，但愚蠢到足以摧毁一个文明。
“Switchboards” may impress you as an extravagant term for brain behavior. Some interesting experiments on the cortex were reported to the American Medical Association in June, 1937. A delicate operation was performed first on the brains of monkeys, then on some twenty human subjects with severe and apparently incurable mental ailments. Small cores of white matter in the frontal lobes of the brain were surgically separated from the rest of the white matter. The hypothesis was that some mental disorders may be due to fixed patterns of response in association centers. If the connections—or switches—were broken, opportunity might be given for a new set of patterns to be formed along different lines.
“总机”可能会给你留下深刻的印象，因为这是一个描述大脑行为的夸张术语。 1937 年 6 月，美国医学会报告了一些有趣的大脑皮层实验。首先对猴子的大脑进行了精密的手术，然后对大约 20 名患有严重且显然无法治愈的精神疾病的人类受试者进行了手术。通过手术将大脑额叶中的小白质核心与其余白质分离。该假设是，某些精神障碍可能是由于关联中心的固定反应模式造成的。如果连接（或开关）被破坏，则可能有机会沿着不同的路线形成一组新的模式。
Wild monkeys responded to the operation by changing from “apprehensive, anxious and hostile creatures of the jungle into creatures as gentle as the organ grinder’s monkey.” More than half the human subjects were improved in varying degrees from such conditions as “tension, apprehension, anxiety, depression, insomnia, suicidal ideas, delusions, hallucinations, crying spells, melancholia, panic states and hysterical paralysis.” The number of cases was not enough to justify carving the brains of all asylum patients. Surgery is a drastic method for curing bad semantic habits. But the experiment furnishes dramatic evidence of the physical fact of association patterns, or switchboards, in the brain.
野生猴子对这次行动的反应是从“丛林中忧心忡忡、焦虑不安、充满敌意的动物变成了像绞刑场的猴子一样温柔的动物”。超过一半的人类受试者的“紧张、忧虑、焦虑、抑郁、失眠、自杀念头、妄想、幻觉、哭泣、忧郁、恐慌状态和歇斯底里性瘫痪”等状况得到了不同程度的改善。病例数量不足以证明对所有庇护患者进行大脑切除是合理的。手术是治愈不良语义习惯的一种彻底方法。但该实验为大脑中关联模式或交换机的物理事实提供了戏剧性的证据。
Korzybski gives a vivid analogy for the course of messages from the environment to the “me.” Here is a good motion picture representing a dramatic incident. As we watch, our emotions are aroused; we “live through” the drama. The details, however, tend to be blurred, and shortly we forget them, or in an attempt to repeat the story later we falsify them. Now let us run the same film at slow motion, stopping on a given “still” from time to time. The drama which so stirred us becomes, under analysis, a series of static pictures with measurable differences between them. The moving picture represents the processes going on in the lower nerve centers, close to life, rapid, shifting, emotive, hard to remember. The arrested film represents the processes in the higher centers, especially the cortex, where the impulses from beyond our skins are halted, analyzed, checked with memory and experience. Over the movie we tend to feel emotion, over the stills, to think.
科日布斯基对信息从环境到“我”的过程进行了生动的类比。这是一部表现戏剧性事件的好电影。当我们观看时，我们的情绪被激发；我们“经历”了这出戏剧。然而，细节往往很模糊，很快我们就会忘记它们，或者为了稍后重复这个故事，我们伪造了它们。现在让我们以慢动作播放同一部电影，时不时地停在给定的“静止图像”上。经过分析，如此激动人心的戏剧变成了一系列静态图片，它们之间存在明显的差异。动态图像代表了较低神经中枢正在发生的过程，接近生活，快速，变化，情绪化，难以记住。被逮捕的电影代表了高级中心的过程，特别是皮层，在那里，来自我们皮肤之外的冲动被停止，分析，并用记忆和经验进行检查。通过电影，我们倾向于感受到情感，通过剧照，我们倾向于思考。
Let us observe three caterpillars, C1, C2, and C3, plain, striped, and fuzzy. C1 is positively heliotropic; he moves automatically toward the light. C2 is negatively heliotropic; he moves toward the dark. C3 is neutral; light and dark are one to him. Which caterpillar will survive? C1, because as he crawls toward the light he finds leaves to eat. He survives under conditions of this earth. If trees grew upside down with leaves in the ground and roots in the air, C2 would survive. C3 poor fellow, is out of luck in either world. The human nervous system demands for survival, under conditions of this earth, sensation, reflection, action, in that order. The reflection is a check back to past experience.
让我们观察三只毛毛虫，C1、C2 和 C3，分别是普通毛毛虫、条纹毛毛虫和毛毛毛虫。 C1具有正向日光性；他自动地走向光明。 C2具有负向日光性；他走向黑暗。 C3为中性；光明与黑暗对他来说是合一的。哪只毛毛虫能活下来？ C1，因为当他爬向光亮时，他发现了可以吃的叶子。他在这个地球的条件下生存。如果树木倒置生长，叶子长在地上，根长在空中，C2 就能生存。 C3 可怜的家伙，在这两个世界里都不走运。在这个地球的条件下，人类的神经系统为了生存而需要感觉、反射、行动，按这个顺序。反思是对过去经验的回顾。
Even so lowly an animal as the amoeba is supposed to consult its memory before taking action: “Hello! Thingumbob again!” to quote William James. Without memory of past experience, we would go off half-cocked at a new sensation, and soon be as extinct as the brontosaurus. At bottom the nervous system is a survival mechanism, with the outside world as the relentless judge. Furthermore, we should not think of the nervous system as a thing by itself, but as an integral part of the organism as a whole. The deification of the head as against the lowly body stems from the fixed categories of the ancient Greeks. You cannot run from a bear or a motorcar on your head.
即使是像变形虫这样低等的动物，在采取行动之前也应该查阅它的记忆：“你好！又是辛甘博布！”引用威廉·詹姆斯的话。如果没有对过去经历的记忆，我们就会在新的感觉面前不知所措，很快就会像雷龙一样灭绝。归根结底，神经系统是一种生存机制，外部世界是无情的评判者。此外，我们不应该将神经系统视为一个单独的东西，而应将其视为整个有机体的一个组成部分。相对于卑微的身体而言，头部的神化源于古希腊人的固定范畴。你无法逃避头顶上的熊或汽车。
The amoeba notes a shape swimming and feels—but does not say—another pesky Thingumbob. I have a somewhat larger store of Thingumbobs in my memory. Where have they come from? For almost fifty years I have been receiving direct physical stimuli through eyes, ears, touch, taste, from the outside world, with samples from all the continents except Asia and Australia. Many of these stimuli have been through the elaborate electrical mechanism of my cortex and have been filed for future reference. I did not have to be warned about hornets twice. In writing this book I am thinking, or trying to. This means combing the files of experience, making certain physical observations, and articulating the combinations produced.
变形虫注意到一个正在游泳的形状，并感觉到——但没有说出——另一个讨厌的东西。我记忆中的 Thingumbobs 存储量要大一些。他们从哪里来？近五十年来，我一直通过眼睛、耳朵、触觉、味觉从外界接受直接的物理刺激，样本来自除亚洲和澳大利亚以外的所有大陆。其中许多刺激已经通过我大脑皮层复杂的电机制，并已归档以供将来参考。我不必两次收到关于黄蜂的警告。在写这本书的过程中，我正在思考，或者说正在尝试。这意味着梳理经验档案，进行某些物理观察，并阐明所产生的组合。
For more than forty years I have been reading about the direct experiences of other people—explorers, scientists, research workers. If I can connect in the file room their experiences with some of my own firsthand experiences, my knowledge of the world is enlarged. If I cannot connect them, the words I read just go round and round in my head. When I was a schoolboy, this circular performance was painfully frequent. I have read and listened to other people’s interpretations of their experiences and passed them through the censorship of my mind—always on the basis of past experience, for this can be my only reference.
四十多年来，我一直在阅读其他人——探险家、科学家、研究工作者——的直接经历。如果我能在档案室中将他们的经历与我自己的一些第一手经历联系起来，我对世界的了解就会扩大。如果我无法将它们联系起来，我读到的文字就会在我的脑海中转来转去。当我还是个小学生的时候，这种循环表演经常发生，令人痛苦。我读过、听过其他人对他们经历的解释，并通过我头脑的审查——总是基于过去的经历，因为这可能是我唯一的参考。
And for thirty years and more I have been respectfully reading and hearing other people’s abstract notions about philosophy, religion, art, economics, sociology, and politics—for the bulk of which I have had no standard of judgment, because the notions corresponded to no direct experience either in my own life or in that of the speaker. We have both been short of Thingumbobs.
三十多年来，我一直恭敬地阅读和聆听其他人关于哲学、宗教、艺术、经济学、社会学和政治的抽象概念——对于其中大部分我没有判断标准，因为这些概念不符合任何现实。在我自己的生活中或在说话者的生活中的直接经验。我们都缺少 Thingumbobs。
From the first two sets of experience listed above I accumulated meanings useful for. my survival and my comfort. From the last experience I gained little but confusion and misunderstanding.
从上面列出的前两组经验中，我积累了有用的意义。我的生存和我的舒适。从上次的经历中，我除了困惑和误解之外，收获甚少。
Thinking is always tied to memory and experience. A thermometer has no memory and responds to a zero temperature now. A man responds to zero temperature by remembering the last time he got his toes frostbitten. Richards says:
思考总是与记忆和经验联系在一起。温度计没有记忆，现在只能响应零温度。男人对零气温的反应是回想起上次脚趾被冻伤的时间。理查兹说：
The mind is a connecting organ; it works only by connecting and it can connect in an indefinitely large number of ways. Words are meeting points at which regions of experience come together; a part of the mind’s endless endeavor to order itself.
头脑是一个连接器官；它只能通过连接来工作，并且可以以无限多种方式进行连接。言语是不同经验领域的交汇点。这是心灵为了秩序而不断努力的一部分。
Experience has the character of a recurrence of similar contexts. It is the key to the problem of meaning. When we encounter something brand-new, a crisis in meaning develops. There is no memorandum in the files. Every kitten has such a crisis when it first opens its eyes—dazzling new Thingumbobs on every hand. Einstein with his theory of relativity was responsible for one crisis in meaning, Max Planck with his quantum theory for another. Scientists had never consciously experienced the phenomena, and for a time were stunned and baffled. Nonscientists often meet new experience without humility, in an arrogant determination not to be caught napping. They jeer at Fulton’s steamboat, laugh heartily at a horseless carriage operated by gasoline; presently they are going to tell you that semantics is nonsense.
经验具有类似情境重复出现的特征。这是意义问题的关键。当我们遇到全新的事物时，就会出现意义危机。文件中没有备忘录。每只小猫第一次睁开眼睛时都会遇到这样的危机——每只手上都有令人眼花缭乱的新东西。爱因斯坦的相对论造成了一场意义危机，马克斯·普朗克的量子理论造成了另一场意义危机。科学家们从未有意识地经历过这种现象，一度感到震惊和困惑。非科学家在面对新的经历时常常不谦虚，他们傲慢地决心不被人发现打瞌睡。他们嘲笑富尔顿的汽船，嘲笑由汽油驱动的无马马车；现在他们会告诉你语义学是无稽之谈。
Kittens and good scientists tend to let new experience pour in until some kind of workable relationships with past experience are established. They do not pretend to know all about something that they know nothing about. We should do well to emulate them.
小猫和优秀的科学家倾向于让新的经验涌入，直到与过去的经验建立某种可行的关系。他们不会假装知道所有他们一无所知的事情。我们应该好好效仿他们。

CATS AND BABIES
猫和婴儿
HERE beside me on the table as I write, occasionally running a tentative paw through the littered sheets of manuscript and notes, is Hobie Baker, a tawny yellow tomcat, named for a great hockey-player. Hobie will never learn to talk. He can learn to respond to my talk, as he responds to other signs—sounds, smells, sights in his environment. He can utter cries indicating pain, pleasure, or excitement. He can announce that he wants to go out of doors, and let there be no delay about it. But he cannot master words and language. This in some respects is fortunate for Hobie, for he will not suffer from hallucinations provoked by bad language. He will remain a realist all his life, interpreting real things on the macroscopic level with appropriate responses, and having no traffic with philosophy or formal logic. It is highly improbable that he will ever suffer from a nervous breakdown. He is certainly able to think after a fashion, interpreting signs in the light of past experience, deliberately deciding his course of action, the survival value of which is high.
当我写作时，霍比·贝克坐在我旁边的桌子上，偶尔用爪子试探性地翻阅散落的手稿和笔记，它是一只黄褐色的雄猫，以一位伟大的曲棍球运动员的名字命名。霍比永远学不会说话。他可以学会对我的谈话做出反应，就像他对周围环境中的其他信号——声音、气味、景象做出反应一样。他可以发出表示痛苦、快乐或兴奋的哭声。他可以宣布他想出去，并且不要拖延。但他无法掌握文字和语言。从某些方面来说，这对霍比来说是幸运的，因为他不会因为脏话而产生幻觉。他将终生保持现实主义者的态度，从宏观层面解释现实事物并做出适当的反应，不与哲学或形式逻辑有任何联系。他不太可能会精神崩溃。他当然能够按照时尚进行思考，根据过去的经验解释信号，谨慎地决定自己的行动方针，其生存价值很高。
Instead of words, Hobie occasionally uses a crude gesture language. We know that he has a nervous system corresponding to that in man, with messages coming in to the receptors in skin, ear, and eye and going over the wires to the cortex, where memories are duly filed for reference. There are fewer switchboards in his cortex than in mine, which may be one reason why he cannot learn to talk. Relatively more of his behavior is under the direction of the lower nervous centers.
霍比有时不使用言语，而是使用粗俗的手势语言。我们知道他有一个与人类相对应的神经系统，信息传入皮肤、耳朵和眼睛的受体，然后通过电线到达皮层，在那里记忆被及时归档以供参考。他的皮质中的总机比我的少，这可能是他无法学习说话的原因之一。他的行为相对更多是在下层神经中枢的指挥下进行的。
Apparently he thinks, connects referents with memory, proceeds to many actions as a result of contemplation evoking a decision. He deals in abstractions of a low order. After he has encountered enough individual objects showing a rough similarity, his filing system informs him of the equivalent of “Hell, there’s another man!” or “Great Zeus, a mouse!” It is no longer necessary to investigate every man and mouse, for he has achieved an abstract idea of men and mice in general. Similarly with beds, sofas, doors, chairs, and other things he uses frequently. He finds meaning in doors-in-general. and proves it by going to a door in a strange house to be let out. This is probably as far as his abstraction process goes and probably as far as any animal can go without language. Hobie’s idea of causality is not profound. If he objects to being combed, he spits and claws at the comb, not at the human being who wields it.
显然，他思考，将所指对象与记忆联系起来，通过沉思引发决定而采取许多行动。他研究的是低阶抽象。当他遇到足够多表现出大致相似性的单个物体后，他的文件系统会告诉他相当于“天哪，还有一个人！”或者“伟大的宙斯，一只老鼠！”不再需要去考察每一个人和老鼠，因为他已经获得了一个关于人和老鼠的总体抽象概念。床、沙发、门、椅子和其他他经常使用的东西也是如此。他在一般意义上的门中找到了意义。并通过走到一所陌生房子的门口来证明这一点。这可能是他的抽象过程所能达到的极限，也可能是任何动物在没有语言的情况下所能达到的极限。霍比的因果关系思想并不深刻。如果他反对被梳理，他就会向梳子吐口水、用爪子抓，而不是向梳梳子的人。
The higher in the animal scale one goes, the longer may be the time before reaction to a given situation is completed. The amoeba reacts almost immediately. Hobie sees a field mouse, but he does not spring. He crouches and stalks. A man may deliberately turn his back on the prey, and go into the barn for a gun.
动物等级越高，对特定情况做出反应所需的时间就越长。阿米巴原虫几乎立即做出反应。霍比看到一只田鼠，但他没有跳起来。他蹲下并追寻。一个人可能会故意背对猎物，走进谷仓去拿枪。
Meaning comes to Hobie as it comes to me, through past experience. If my experience has been only with gentle dogs and I identify gentleness with dogs-in-general, I am likely to be shocked and pained some day when I mistake a savage barn-defender for a “dog.” There are no dogs-in-general in the world of experience, but only Rover1, Rover2, Rover3, some gentle, some neutral, and some vicious. Similarly, Hobie may form a concept of snakes-in-general from acquaintance with harmless black snakes, and some day—God forbid—meet a copperhead in the swamp. Cattle sometimes die of poisonous weeds because they have wrongly identified all young green growing things with good edible grass.
通过过去的经验，霍比的意义与我一样。如果我的经历只是与温柔的狗相处，并且我认为一般的狗都是温柔的，那么有一天，当我把一个野蛮的谷仓守卫误认为是“狗”时，我可能会感到震惊和痛苦。经验世界里没有一般的狗，只有Rover1、Rover2、Rover3，有的温柔，有的中性，有的凶恶。同样，霍比可能会通过熟悉无害的黑蛇而形成一般蛇的概念，并且有一天（上帝禁止）在沼泽中遇到铜头蛇。牛有时会死于有毒杂草，因为它们错误地将所有年轻的绿色植物视为良好的食用草。
Generally speaking, animals tend to learn cumulatively through experience. The old elephant is the wisest of the herd. This selective process does not always operate in the case of human beings. The old are sometimes wise, but more often they are stuffed above the average with superstitions, misconceptions, and irrational dogmas. The window of the Union League Club comes to mind. Philosophers and medicine men are normally past the prime of life. Why is this? One may hazard the guess that erroneous identifications in human beings are pickled and preserved in words, and so not subject to the constant check of the environment, as in the case of cats and elephants. In the end, of course, a day of reckoning arrives. We are not permitted to misinterpret the environment indefinitely.
一般来说，动物倾向于通过经验累积学习。老象是象群中最聪明的。这种选择性过程并不总是适用于人类。老年人有时很聪明，但更多时候，他们充满了迷信、误解和非理性教条，高于平均水平。我想到了联盟联赛俱乐部的窗户。哲学家和医学家通常已经过了壮年。为什么是这样？人们可能会大胆猜测，人类的错误识别被腌制并保存在文字中，因此不会像猫和大象那样受到环境的不断检查。当然，最终清算的一天到来了。我们不被允许无限期地误解环境。
Pavlov’s laboratory can cause Rover1 to identify food with sound, switching the association pattern from smell to sound by ringing a bell whenever food is ready. When he hears the bell he comes a-running. This creates an artificial identification. By repeated switchings and counterswitchings, a fine case of nervous collapse can be induced in Rover. One must go to considerable trouble in a laboratory to make an animal crazy by building up erroneous identifications. The route to craziness for human beings is practically effortless.
巴甫洛夫的实验室可以让 Rover1 通过声音来识别食物，只要食物准备好就按响铃，将关联模式从气味切换到声音。当他听到铃声时，他就跑过来。这创造了一种人工识别。通过反复的切换和反切换，可以在漫游者中引发神经崩溃。在实验室里，要通过建立错误的识别来使动物发疯，必须付出相当大的努力。对于人类来说，通往疯狂的道路实际上是毫不费力的。
Hobie cannot talk, but a parrot can. Is a parrot, then, the higher animal? Obviously not. Parrot talk is imitation of sound, and has no connection with thought or meaning. The symbols have no referents, either real or imagined. He just likes to hear himself talk. Little boys learn lines of Latin verse by a similar mindless process, though I never heard of one who liked it. Sailors sometimes acquire a few words of a foreign language just for sound effects, and are grieved to learn by brisk physical assault that they have insulted somebody’s grandmother in unmentionable ways. Speaking without knowing is called “psittacism,” but is a practice not confined to parrots.
霍比不会说话，但鹦鹉可以。那么，鹦鹉是高等动物吗？很明显不是。鹦鹉学舌是对声音的模仿，与思想或意义无关。这些符号没有任何指称，无论是真实的还是想象的。他只是喜欢听自己说话。小男孩通过类似的无意识过程来学习拉丁诗句，尽管我从未听说有人喜欢它。水手们有时只是为了音效而学习一些外语单词，并且通过轻快的身体攻击得知他们以不可告人的方式侮辱了某人的祖母，他们感到悲伤。无意识地说话被称为“鹦鹉学舌”，但这种做法并不局限于鹦鹉学舌。
I find Hobie a useful exhibit along this difficult trail of semantics. What “meaning” connotes to him is often so clear and simple that I have no trouble in following it. I come from a like evolutionary matrix. “Meaning” to me has like roots, and a like mechanism of apprehension. I have a six-cylinder brain and he has a one-lunger, but they operate on like principles. (I am having difficulty avoiding the word “same.” No two things in this world are ever the same, or completely identical.) When I grow bewildered in the jungles of language, I return to observation of Hobie as a kind of compass line. “What do you mean?” one asks. Well, what does a cat mean? Then I try to build up from that foundation, so fresh and close to the boundary where inside meets outside.
我发现霍比在这条艰难的语义之路上是一个有用的展览。他所说的“意义”往往是那么清晰和简单，我可以毫不费力地理解它。我来自一个类似的进化矩阵。对我来说，“意义”有相似的根源和相似的理解机制。我有一个六缸大脑，他有一个单冲程大脑，但它们的运作原理相似。 （我很难避免使用“相同”这个词。这个世界上没有两件事是相同或完全相同的。）当我在语言的丛林中变得困惑时，我回到对霍比的观察，将其视为一种罗盘线。 “你是什么意思？”有人问。那么，猫是什么意思呢？然后我尝试在这个基础上进行构建，如此新鲜且接近内部与外部交汇的边界。
BABIES
婴儿
An adult may have characteristics in common with a cat, but the infant has more. He arrives from warm, safe shelter to what William James called a big, blooming, buzzing confusion. He brings with him only two instinctive fears, if Watson is to be credited, fear of falling, and fear of some loud sounds. He is quite indifferent to snakes, bears, spiders, lions. During his first few months millions of signs strike the sensitive receptors in his skin and trace patterns in his nervous system. To them he reacts unconsciously at first, then gradually, marvelously, with dawning consciousness. Most sounds made by an infant are expressions of some emotional state correlated with a definite situation—a moving object in the outside world, hunger or pain inside. These sounds have significance to those who tend and care for him. Presently cries and gurgles give way to articulated syllables—“goo,” “ma,” “ba”—mixed and blurred with plain squawks and yells.
成年人可能具有与猫相同的特征，但婴儿有更多特征。他从温暖、安全的避难所来到了威廉·詹姆斯所说的一个巨大的、盛开的、嗡嗡作响的混乱之地。如果沃森可信的话，他只带来两种本能的恐惧，那就是害怕摔倒，以及害怕一些响亮的声音。他对蛇、熊、蜘蛛、狮子都相当冷漠。在他出生的最初几个月里，数以百万计的信号袭击了他皮肤上的敏感受体，并在他的神经系统中留下了痕迹。他对它们的反应一开始是无意识的，然后逐渐地、奇妙地、有了意识的觉醒。婴儿发出的大多数声音都是与特定情况相关的某种情绪状态的表达——外部世界的移动物体、内部的饥饿或疼痛。这些声音对于那些照顾他的人来说具有重要意义。目前，哭声和咯咯声被清晰的音节所取代——“咕”、“马”、“巴”——与简单的嘎嘎声和叫喊混合在一起，变得模糊。
Then comes the exciting moment—the beginning of human language, the point which Hobie Baker can never reach! Syllables come out of the blur of noises; objects come out of the blur of the world outside. Mother or nurse encourages the imitation of certain sounds. Presently syllable and object take on a rough correlation. The word and the thing merge. Remember this, for it is at once the beginning of genuine humanity and the beginning of one of humanity’s greatest trials. The word and the thing merge. All wearers of pants become “Dah-dee,” but after a little, only the father himself.
接下来是激动人心的时刻——人类语言的开始，这是霍比·贝克永远无法达到的境界！音节从模糊的噪音中发出；物体从外面的模糊世界中显现出来。母亲或护士鼓励模仿某些声音。目前，音节和宾语具有粗略的相关性。词与物融为一体。请记住这一点，因为它既是真正人性的开始，也是人类最伟大考验之一的开始。词与物融为一体。所有穿裤子的人都变成了“Dah-dee”，但过了一会儿，只有父亲本人了。
For a considerable period, word and gesture language develop together. The child asks to be taken up, or more simply, holds up his arms. He points to what he wants, even as Hobie sits up and begs for food. Gesture language is clear and effective. After the child begins to go to school, word language rapidly takes precedence over gesture. Words, unlike pointing, have no meaning in themselves. Except for such imitative sounds as “buzz,” “bang,” “honk,” “quack,” “hiss,” “purr,” most words are as purely symbolic as x, y, and z. But they can carry communication far beyond the limits of gesture, and children practice them with as much gusto as Hobie stalks a mouse. Failure to learn to speak is very rare. Only in some deaf-mutes, and in the last degree of imbecility, is speech impossible. The roots of vocal language run deep.
在相当长的一段时间内，言语和手势语言共同发展。孩子要求被抱起来，或者更简单地说，举起他的手臂。他指出他想要的东西，而霍比则坐起来乞讨食物。手势语言清晰有效。孩子开始上学后，言语很快就取代了手势。与指示不同，言语本身没有任何意义。除了“嗡嗡”、“砰”、“喇叭”、“嘎嘎”、“嘶嘶”、“咕噜”等模仿声音外，大多数单词都像 x、y 和 z 一样纯粹是象征性的。但它们的交流能力远远超出了手势的限制，孩子们练习它们的热情就像霍比跟踪老鼠一样。无法学会说话的情况非常罕见。只有某些聋哑人，在极其愚蠢的情况下，才不可能说话。有声语言的根源很深。
There is usually strong emotion with the infant’s early syllables—the piercing joy of recognition; the sudden fear expressed by “No! No!”; the excitement of “See!”; the demand to handle and touch. The word “ma-ma.” uttered in a piteous voice, possesses the miraculous power of materializing that person. Here, to follow Malinowski, we note the seeds of word magic, in which the name gives power over the person or thing it signifies. in the next chapter we shall examine word magic at some length. The speech of a child is seldom reflective or thought-provoking; the files of the cortex are still relatively bare. Words are active forces which give a measure of control over the environment—attract this, repulse that. Words mean in so far as they act. With the passing of the years, the child learns to divorce words from direct action, but the close association at his most formative period makes him a potential candidate for word magic throughout his life.
婴儿的早期音节通常带有强烈的情感——认出的强烈喜悦； “不！”所表达的突然的恐惧。不！”; “看！”的兴奋；处理和触摸的需求。 “妈妈”这个词。以悲惨的声音说出的话，拥有使那个人实体化的神奇力量。在这里，跟随马林诺夫斯基的脚步，我们注意到了单词魔法的种子，其中名字赋予了它所代表的人或事物的力量。在下一章中，我们将详细研究单词魔法。孩子的言语很少是反思性的或发人深省的；皮质的文件仍然相对裸露。言语是一种主动力量，可以在一定程度上控制环境——吸引这个，排斥那个。言语的意义就在于它们的行动。随着岁月的流逝，孩子学会了将言语与直接行动分开，但在他最成长期的密切联系使他成为终生使用言语魔法的潜在候选人。
“There’s going to be a ’splosion!
“将会发生‘爆炸’！
“Boom!!
“繁荣！！
“ ’Splosion’s all over.”
“‘爆炸一切都结束了。’”
In this classic example, the word made an entirely satisfactory explosion. Little Willy may some day become Senator William A. Blower, to announce with passionate conviction:
在这个经典的例子中，这个词引起了完全令人满意的爆炸。小威利有一天可能会成为参议员威廉·A·布洛尔 (William A. Blower)，他怀着充满激情的信念宣布：
Are we ready to throw to the winds that age-old and revered principle derived from the great Magna Carta and engraved on our fundamental codes that no one shall be deprived of life, liberty, and property except by due process of law? If we are not, this is the time to arise in our might and fight, that our institutions shall not be ruthlessly violated. Our courts have been rendered servile. The entire government has been seized by one man. Here and now we must scotch the threat of dictatorship so that it may never again rear its ugly head. . . .
我们是否准备好抛弃源自伟大大宪章并刻在我们基本法典中的古老而受人尊敬的原则，即除非通过正当法律程序，否则任何人不得被剥夺生命、自由和财产？如果我们不这样做，那么现在就是我们奋起战斗的时候了，这样我们的制度就不会被无情地侵犯。我们的法庭已沦为奴仆。整个政府已被一个人占领。此时此地，我们必须消除独裁政权的威胁，使其永远不再露出丑陋的头颅。 。 。 。
Boom! ’Splosion’s all over.
繁荣！ '爆炸一切都结束了。
Children are prone to uncritical identification. They appreciate resemblances more than differences. They love great big things and little tiny things, and are unmindful of the middle ground where most things lie. They see some elements in a situation but leave out many of its characteristics. They frequently generalize from one or two instances. “A million cats in the back yard last night!” boils down, on cross-examination, to “Well, there was our old cat and another one.”
儿童容易不加批判地认同。他们更欣赏相似之处而不是差异。他们既喜欢伟大的事物，也喜欢微小的事物，而忽视了大多数事物的中间立场。他们看到了某种情况中的一些要素，但却忽略了它的许多特征。他们经常从一两个例子中进行概括。 “昨晚后院有一百万只猫！”经过盘问，归结为“嗯，有我们的老猫和另一只猫。”
Thus it appears that most children do not long maintain Hobie Baker’s realistic appraisal of the environment. Verbal identifications and confused abstractions begin at a tender age. Children are usually more realistic than adults in the matter of morals, however. Current notions of what constitutes right and wrong must be hammered into them, since they are born amoral. If a child is taught these lessons without also learning to abuse the verb “to be,” he is fortunate. “Dirt is bad.” “If your hands are dirty, you are a bad boy.” “It is wrong to kick papa.” “Be good.” Such admonitions build up a massive chain of illegitimate identifications.
由此可见，大多数孩子并没有长期保持霍比·贝克对环境的现实评价。言语识别和混乱的抽象概念从很小的时候就开始了。然而，在道德问题上，儿童通常比成人更现实。当前关于什么是对什么是错的观念必须灌输给他们，因为它们生来不道德。如果一个孩子在接受这些课程的同时又没有学会滥用动词“to be”，那么他是幸运的。 “污垢是不好的。” “如果你的手脏了，你就是个坏孩子。” “踢爸爸是不对的。” “乖一点。”此类警告形成了一条巨大的非法身份识别链。
Language is no more than crudely acquired before children begin to suffer from it, and to misinterpret the world by reason of it. Is the fault to be charged to the child, or to the language taught him?
在儿童开始遭受语言之苦并因此而误解世界之前，语言只不过是粗略地习得的。错误应该归咎于孩子，还是归咎于他所学的语言？
Jerome Frank lists some results of asking children about the names of things:1
杰罗姆·弗兰克列出了一些向孩子询问事物名称的结果：1
The sun is so called because it behaves as if it were the sun.
太阳之所以如此命名，是因为它的行为就像太阳一样。
The stars are so called because they are that shape.
星星之所以如此命名，是因为它们具有这种形状。
A table, because it is used for writing.
一张桌子，因为它是用来写字的。
Clouds, because they are all gray.
云，因为它们都是灰色的。
How firmly the child believes in the reality of the word! It comes first; it is strong in its own right.
这个孩子多么坚定地相信这个词的真实性！它是第一位的；它本身就很强大。
Some day children will be taught to a different pattern, perhaps like this:
有一天，孩子们会被教导一种不同的模式，也许是这样的：
That bright ball up in the sky warms us and gives us light. It is a long, long way off. It is called “the sun.” It might have been called “nus” or “dree” or anything. In Mexico they call it “sol.” Where words come from is always interesting but not very important. Once somebody made them up out of his head, as you and Emma Jane made up a private language in the orchard the other day. You can take a ride in this metal machine here that I touch with my hand, but you can’t take a ride in the word “autogiro.” You can pretend to take a ride? Oh, yes, you can pretend. That’s always fun. But if you want to fly with me to Nantucket to play in the sand this afternoon, we can’t very well climb on the back of those letters, can we?
天空中那个明亮的球体温暖了我们并给我们带来光明。还有很长很长的路要走。它被称为“太阳”。它可能被称为“nus”或“dree”或其他任何名称。在墨西哥，他们称之为“sol”。词语的来源总是很有趣，但并不是很重要。曾经有人凭空编造出这些语言，就像前几天你和艾玛·简在果园里编造了一种私人语言一样。你可以乘坐这里我用手触摸的金属机器，但你不能乘坐“autogiro”这个词。你可以假装搭车吗？哦，是的，你可以假装。这总是很有趣。但如果你想今天下午和我一起飞往楠塔基特岛去玩沙子，我们就不能很好地爬到那些字母的背面，可以吗？

PRIMITIVE PEOPLES
原始人
LET us look at Trobriand Islanders, with the invaluable assistance of Malinowski.1 How do primitive peoples draw meaning from language?
让我们在马林诺夫斯基的宝贵帮助下看看特罗布里恩群岛的居民。1 原始人如何从语言中获取意义？
We run front-wood ourselves
我们自己经营前木
We paddle in place
我们原地划桨
We turn, we see companion ours,
我们转身，看到我们的同伴，
He runs rear-wood behind their sea arm Pilolu.
他在他们的海臂Pilolu后面跑后木。
This represents a word-for-word translation into English of an account of a canoeing trip. It does not sound exciting, yet the native who delivered it was magnificently excited. These words as translated cannot express the idea that the speaker had. No foreign reader can hope to understand what he said. Why? Because the words are bound up with native activities. Torn from the context of that culture, and placed nakedly on the pages of a book, they mean almost nothing. Malinowski learned to understand these words only after living as the natives lived, handling their tools, paddling in their canoes, discovering their rituals and traditions. He had to experience with his own senses their life before he could understand clearly what they spoke. In due time he determined that the words carried a boast that one canoe had beaten a neighbor’s canoe in a race while passing through the sea arm of Pilolu.
这代表了一次独木舟旅行的逐字翻译成英文。听起来并不令人兴奋，但讲出这句话的当地人却非常兴奋。这些话翻译后无法表达说话者的想法。任何外国读者都无法理解他所说的话。为什么？因为这些词与本土活动息息相关。脱离了那种文化的背景，赤裸裸地放在书页上，它们几乎没有任何意义。马林诺夫斯基只有在像当地人一样生活、操作他们的工具、划独木舟、发现他们的仪式和传统之后才学会理解这些词。必须用自己的感官去体验他们的生活，才能听清楚他们所说的话。在适当的时候，他确定这些话带有一种夸耀，即一艘独木舟在经过皮洛卢海臂时在一场比赛中击败了邻居的独木舟。
R. C. Thurnwald, anthropologist of the University of Berlin, confirms the findings of Malinowski. He spent seven years in New Guinea. After learning a native language, he found that meaning was often blocked because “native words carry symbolic implications entirely different from our own.” Missionaries with a linguistic gift told Thurnwald that after six years of study of one tongue they were not sure that they had mastered the niceties and subtleties of the native idiom. Even pidgin English carries various meanings. “Me lose him balus” may signify either “I forgot to take it with me” or “I missed my shot at the bird.”
柏林大学人类学家 RC Thurnwald 证实了马林诺夫斯基的发现。他在新几内亚度过了七年。在学习母语后，他发现意义常常被阻碍，因为“母语单词所具有的象征意义与我们自己的完全不同。”具有语言天赋的传教士告诉图恩瓦尔德，经过六年的一种语言的学习，他们不确定自己是否掌握了当地习语的细节和微妙之处。甚至洋泾浜英语也有多种含义。 “我失去了他 balus”可能意味着“我忘记带它了”或“我错过了对那只鸟的射击”。
No foreigner can really learn a tribal language from books, for it is a mixture of words and “context of situation.” For this reason, too, no living person can get more than a fraction of the meaning out of dead languages, for he can never personally live through the experiences of the culture which fashioned them. To the modern student, Greek and Latin classics are isolated documents severed from the context of situation. It would be an interesting study to prepare a parallel-column exhibit of the day-by-day experience of Socrates and say Bernard Shaw or Einstein, and note the similarities and the differences. But the data on Socrates are probably unobtainable.
没有一个外国人能够真正从书本上学习部落语言，因为它是单词和“情景语境”的混合体。也正是出于这个原因，任何活着的人都只能从死去的语言中获得一小部分意义，因为他永远无法亲自经历塑造这些语言的文化的经历。对于现代学生来说，希腊语和拉丁语经典是脱离情境的孤立文献。准备一个平行的柱状展览，展示苏格拉底和萧伯纳或爱因斯坦的日常经历，并注意它们的相似之处和不同之处，这将是一项有趣的研究。但关于苏格拉底的数据恐怕是无法获得的。
Here is a group of Trobriand Islanders on a fishing expedition in the early morning. The palms glitter, and the opalescent sea is quiet. Slowly, cautiously, the canoes run out over the shoal, expert paddlers in the stern, expert lookouts at the bow. There are signs, gestures, directions, technical expressions, occasionally a conventional muted shout. Group action is markedly assisted by this action language—“Pull in!” “Let go!” “Drop the net!” “Shift farther!” Language here is acquired through personal participation. Meaning, as in the case of the infant, comes more from action than from reflection. A group of boys playing baseball on a city lot show similar characteristics: “Batter up!” “Short field!” “Fan him!” “Second, second!” “Hold it!” “Slide!”
这是一群特罗布里恩岛民在清晨进行钓鱼探险。棕榈树闪闪发光，乳白色的大海很安静。独木舟慢慢地、小心翼翼地驶过浅滩，熟练的桨手在船尾，专业的瞭望员在船头。有标志、手势、指示、技术表达，偶尔还有传统的低声喊叫。这种行动语言“拉近！”对团体行动有显着的帮助。 “松手！” “放下网！” “再移远点！”这里的语言是通过个人参与获得的。就像婴儿的情况一样，意义更多地来自行动而不是反思。一群在城市场地打棒球的男孩表现出相似的特征：“击球！” “短场！” “给他扇扇子！” “第二，第二！” “拿住！” “滑动！”
Malinowski analyzes four language patterns in primitive societies:
马林诺夫斯基分析了原始社会的四种语言模式：
1. As a mode of behavior in practical matters like fishing—a mode of action rather than an instrument of reflection.
1. 作为钓鱼等实际事务中的一种行为模式——一种行动模式而不是反思工具。
2. As entertaining narrative—of which the Pilolu story is an example. Here the action is at second hand, but hearers have participated in such canoe races in the past. Their referents are in good working order. The words of a tale are significant because of previous experiences of the listeners.
2. 作为有趣的叙事——Pilolu 的故事就是一个例子。这里的活动是二手的，但听众过去曾参加过此类独木舟比赛。他们的参照物工作状态良好。故事中的文字之所以有意义，是因为听众以前的经历。
3. As free, aimless, social intercourse—greetings on the trail. “Good morning,” “It’s a fine day.” No exact meaning is given or intended (how often have you said “Good morning” when it was long after 12 o’clock?), just a breaking of the unpleasant tension which men feel when facing each other in silence. Conceivably it might be done by gesture language, with bows, salutes, waves of the hand; thumbs up for “Nice day,” thumbs down for “Dirty weather.”
3. 作为自由、漫无目的的社交——路上的问候。 “早上好”，“今天天气很好。”没有给出或有意地给出确切的含义（你有多少次在12点过后很久才说“早上好”？），只是打破人们在沉默中面对面时所感受到的不愉快的紧张感。可以想象，这可以通过手势语言来完成，比如鞠躬、敬礼、挥手；竖起大拇指表示“美好的一天”，竖起大拇指表示“恶劣的天气”。
4. As ritual word magic in the casting of spells, curses, prayers. Here the word is often held more potent than the thing: the mountain will come to Mahomet at his call; the symbol shall overthrow the referent. This is big medicine, but it seems to be a not unnatural development from the infant’s early confusion of thing and word, and from the use of words as action rather than reflection by nature peoples.
4. 作为咒语、诅咒、祈祷等仪式中的文字魔法。在这里，词语往往比事物更有效：山峰将在穆罕默德的召唤下来到他身边；山峰将在穆罕默德的召唤下来到他身边；山峰将在他的呼唤下来到他身边。该符号应推翻所指对象。这是一门大药，但它似乎是一种并非不自然的发展，源于婴儿早期对事物和词语的混淆，以及源于人们将词语用作行动而不是自然反映。
Early in the history of some primitive societies, the “soul-box” theory of meaning appears. The soul box is that receptacle, location unknown, which harbors the spiritual part of a person or thing. Similarly, the word is the magical receptacle which harbors the essences of meaning. The soul-box theory can be recognized in the “real existence” of Plato, and in the assorted “universals” and “absolutes” of medieval scholars. In Chapter 12 we shall present a tray loaded with soul boxes.
在一些原始社会的历史早期，就出现了“灵魂盒”的意义理论。灵魂盒子是一个位置未知的容器，它容纳着一个人或事物的精神部分。同样，词语是蕴含意义本质的神奇容器。灵魂盒论可以在柏拉图的“真实存在”中得到认可，也可以在中世纪学者的各种“普遍性”和“绝对性”中得到认可。在第12章中，我们将展示一个装满灵魂盒子的托盘。
Nature peoples assign names chiefly to things they use. Walking with a native in a New Guinea forest, Malinowski would find his attention arrested by a strange plant. On being asked its name, the native would shrug his shoulders and say, “Oh, that’s just ‘bush.’” A bird with no function in the larder is merely “flying animal.” Malinowski found a general tendency to isolate and name that which stands in some specific connection, traditional or useful, to man and to bundle the rest into limbo. Similarly, I remember the names of those trees and plants which were useful to me as a boy on camping expeditions, or useful in making implements for games. The other flora I learn dutifully from time to time, and soon forget.
自然民族主要为他们使用的事物命名。马林诺夫斯基与当地人一起在新几内亚森林中散步，他会发现一种奇怪的植物吸引了他的注意力。当被问及它的名字时，当地人会耸耸肩说：“哦，那只是‘灌木丛’。”食品储藏室里没有任何功能的鸟只不过是“飞翔的动物”。马林诺夫斯基发现了一种普遍的倾向，即孤立并命名与人类有某种特定联系的东西，无论是传统的还是有用的，而将其余的东西捆绑在一起。同样，我还记得那些对我小时候露营探险有用的树木和植物的名称，或者对制作游戏工具有用的树木和植物的名称。我时不时地尽职尽责地学习其他植物，但很快就忘记了。
Malinowski notes that the natives’ interest is greater in animals than in plants, in shells than in minerals, in flying insects than in crawling ones. Small derails of a landscape are named, big stretches go nameless. Persons come first, animals next, objects last. It follows that animals and objects tend to become personified; animism is rampant among primitive peoples. Do we not catch a glimpse of this in the masculine and feminine gender of Romance languages? Even in English, we say when referring to a shipwreck, “She went down with all hands.” For many people, the old bus is only less human than the family dog.
马林诺夫斯基指出，当地人对动物的兴趣大于对植物的兴趣，对贝壳的兴趣大于对矿物的兴趣，对飞虫的兴趣大于对爬行昆虫的兴趣。景观中的小出轨是有名称的，而大的延伸则无名。首先是人，其次是动物，最后是物体。由此可见，动物和物体往往会变得拟人化。万物有灵论在原始民族中十分盛行。我们难道没有在罗曼语言的男性和女性性别中看到这一点吗？即使在英语中，当我们提到沉船事故时，我们也会说“她与所有人一起沉没”。对于很多人来说，这辆旧巴士的人性仅次于家中的狗。
For, since early experience warrants the substantival existence of anything found within the category of Crude Substance . . . the obvious inference is that such abstract entities or ideas live in a real world of their own. Such harmless adjectives as good or bad, expressing the savage’s half animal satisfaction or dissatisfaction in a situation, subsequently intrude into the enclosure reserved for the clumsy, rough-hewn blocks of primitive substance, are sublimated into Goodness and Badness, and create whole theological worlds, and systems of Thought and Religion. . . . [Yet at bottom] all Linguistic processes derive their power only from real processes taking place in man’s relation to his surroundings.1
因为，由于早期的经验保证了在天然物质类别中发现的任何东西的实质性存在。 。 。显而易见的推论是，这些抽象实体或想法存在于它们自己的现实世界中。这些无害的形容词，如好或坏，表达了野蛮人对某种情况半动物的满足或不满，随后侵入了为笨拙、粗糙的原始物质块保留的围墙，升华为善和恶，并创造了整个神学世界，以及思想和宗教体系。 。 。 。 [但归根结底]所有语言过程都仅从人类与其周围环境的关系中发生的真实过程中获得力量。1
Language, we sometimes assume, is primarily the expression of thought by means of speech sounds. Granting that the observations of Malinowski are well taken, it appears that the reverse is nearer the facts: language as it has developed is less influenced by reflection than thought is influenced by the accepted structure of language. The barbarous primitive substances, entities, and categories have left a deep mark upon more advanced philosophies and speculations. The word is still believed to cast a spell on the thing, and to have power in and of itself. State Senator John McNaboe of New York bitterly opposed a bill for the control of syphilis in May, 1937, because “the innocence of children might be corrupted by a widespread use of the term. . . . This particular word creates a shudder in every decent woman and decent man.”
我们有时认为，语言主要是通过语音表达思想。假设马林诺夫斯基的观察被充分接受，那么事实似乎相反：语言在其发展过程中受反思的影响要小于思想受公认的语言结构的影响。野蛮的原始物质、实体和范畴在更先进的哲学和思辨上留下了深刻的印记。人们仍然相信这个词对事物施了咒语，并且其本身具有力量。 1937 年 5 月，纽约州参议员约翰·麦克纳博 (John McNaboe) 强烈反对一项控制梅毒的法案，因为“儿童的纯真可能会因广泛使用该术语而受到腐蚀。 。 。 。这个特殊的词让每一个正派的女人和正派的男人都感到不寒而栗。”
Obscene words are very interesting semantically. If one says “sexual intercourse,” people are not shocked. But if one articulates an old Anglo-Saxon word of four letters—which my publisher certainly would not tolerate here—most English-speaking persons become rigid with horror. Yet both symbols have precisely the same nonverbal act as referent. Both refer to an identical thing and should carry equal weight as synonyms. It is a strange language structure where X is respectable and normal if you use one symbol for it, but beyond perdition if you use another.
淫秽词语在语义上非常有趣。如果有人说“性交”，人们不会感到震惊。但是，如果有人说出一个由四个字母组成的古老盎格鲁撒克逊单词——我的出版商在这里肯定不会容忍——大多数说英语的人都会因为恐惧而变得僵硬。然而，这两个符号都具有完全相同的非语言行为作为指称。两者都指代相同的事物，并且作为同义词应具有同等的重要性。这是一种奇怪的语言结构，如果你使用一个符号来表示 X，它是受人尊敬和正常的，但如果你使用另一个符号，X 就万劫不复了。
The person has a soul, therefore the serpent has a soul, and it is most “evil”; the sun has a soul, and it is “good.” Upon such foundations have soaring systems of thought been erected, while our scientists grope toward genuine knowledge with half-blind eyes. The world outside has a natural pattern, order, structure. Language has not been reared to correspond to this structure, but has grown on a more devious pattern. We try to impose upon the natural order the tortuous structure of our verbal forms, forcing the world outside to behave as our words behave. Unfortunately it is not that kind of a world.
人有灵魂，蛇也有灵魂，最“恶”；太阳有灵魂，它是“善的”。在这样的基础上，高耸的思想体系被建立起来，而我们的科学家则半盲地摸索着真正的知识。外部世界有自然的模式、秩序、结构。语言并不是为了适应这种结构而产生的，而是以一种更加狡猾的模式发展起来的。我们试图将我们言语形式的曲折结构强加于自然秩序，迫使外部世界按照我们的言语行事。不幸的是，这不是那样的世界。
Word magic is common to all primitive peoples. In a certain West African tribe, before setting up housekeeping it is highly desirable to obtain a Sampa. A Sampa is a prayer written in old magic letters which evil spirits are most likely to understand. It can be purchased at any wizard’s for a few cowrie shells. He makes it while you wait. Into a calabash he puts a bit of clay, a feather, some twigs of straw, or whatever strikes his fancy, and over it chants a spell. Hindu parents who lose a first child by sickness may name the second by some such term as “Dunghill,” on the theory that the gods, who recognize people only by their names, will not bother to waste a curse on such a lowly creature. What is a curse itself but a word winged for carrying physical harm? Frazer gives many examples of word taboos to show the universality of the practice. When a New Zealand chief was called “Wai,” the word for “water,” a new name for water had to be found. To cast a spell on a man’s name was frequently considered as effective as casting it on his person. Names were therefore closely guarded.
文字魔法是所有原始民族共有的。在某个西非部落，在建立家务之前，非常希望获得桑帕。 Sampa 是用古老的魔法字母写成的祈祷文，邪灵最容易理解。它可以在任何巫师处以几颗贝壳购买。当你等待的时候他就做到了。他在葫芦里放了一点粘土、一根羽毛、一些稻草树枝，或者任何他喜欢的东西，然后在上面念诵咒语。印度教父母因病失去第一个孩子时，可能会用“粪堆”之类的词来命名第二个孩子，其理论是，神只通过名字来识别人们，不会费心对这样一个卑微的生物浪费诅咒。诅咒本身不就是一个带有身体伤害的词吗？弗雷泽举了许多词语禁忌的例子来表明这种做法的普遍性。当新西兰酋长被称为“Wai”（意为“水”）时，就必须为水找到一个新名称。人们常常认为对一个人的名字施咒与对他的身体施咒一样有效。因此，名字受到严密保护。
According to Dr. J. P. Harrington of the Smithsonian Institution, terror of the dead was so intense among American Indians that their names were not spoken aloud. Since the dead commonly bore names like “Blue Reindeer” or “Strong Bow,” relatives and friends after the funeral were forced to invent new words for common objects like reindeer and bow, or at least to change the word a little. This brand of magic inevitably resulted in a welter of different names for the same object, and helped to create the babel of more than one hundred languages spoken by American Indians. How many tribal wars resulted from the babel, Dr. Harrington does not attempt to compute. The more wars, the more dead, the more new names, the more dialects, the more “foreigners,” the more wars, the more dead. . . .
据史密森学会的 JP Harrington 博士称，美洲印第安人对死者的恐惧是如此强烈，以至于他们的名字没有被大声说出。由于死者通常有“蓝色驯鹿”或“强力弓”等名字，葬礼结束后，亲戚和朋友被迫为驯鹿和弓等常见物品发明新词，或者至少稍微改变一下这个词。这种魔法不可避免地导致同一物体出现不同的名称，并帮助创造了美洲印第安人使用的一百多种语言的混乱。哈灵顿博士并没有试图计算通天塔引发了多少部族战争。战争越多，死者越多，新名字越多，方言越多，“外国人”越多，战争越多，死者越多。 。 。 。
Word magic is not confined to nature peoples. Herodotus did not dare mention the name “Osiris.” The true and great name of Allah is secret, as are the names of the Brahman gods and the “real” name of Confucius. Orthodox Jews avoid the name “Jahweh.” Among Christian peoples it is against the moral code to use the name of God or that of his Son except on ceremonial occasions, and in such conventions as “God bless you.” Caesar gave a command in Spain to an obscure general called “Scipio” for the sake of the lucky omen his name carried. The Emperor Severus consoled himself for the immoralities of his Empress Julia because she bore the same name as the profligate daughter of Augustus. “Julias,” it appeared, were a bad lot.
文字魔法并不局限于自然民族。希罗多德不敢提及“奥西里斯”这个名字。安拉的真实而伟大的名字是秘密的，婆罗门神的名字和孔子的“真实”名字也是如此。正统犹太人避免使用“耶和华”这个名字。在基督教民族中，除非在仪式场合和诸如“上帝保佑你”之类的惯例中，否则使用上帝或其儿子的名字是违反道德准则的。凯撒在西班牙向一位名叫“西庇阿”的无名将军发出命令，因为他的名字带有幸运的预兆。塞维鲁皇帝为朱莉娅皇后的不道德行为安慰自己，因为她与奥古斯都挥霍无度的女儿同名。 “朱莉娅”看来是个坏人。
Blasphemy, ancient and modern, is a sin based primarily on word magic. If you go out in an American street and shout “Bogom Proklyatii,” citizens will not be shocked and no policeman will touch you. Yet you are shouting “God damn” in Russian. Real-estate operators frequently embellish their swampy and stony subdivisions with such names as “Floral Heights,” “Cedar Gardens,” and “Laurel Meadows,” hoping that the customer will identify the thing with the word. He often does.
亵渎，无论古代还是现代，都是一种主要基于文字魔法的罪孽。如果你走出美国街头并大喊“Bogom Proklyatii”，市民不会感到震惊，也没有警察会碰你。然而你却用俄语大喊“该死”。房地产经营者经常用“花卉高地”、“雪松花园”和“劳雷尔草甸”等名称来美化他们的沼泽和石头分区，希望顾客能用这些词来识别这个东西。他经常这样做。
A Basuto chief in 1861 delivered himself as follows:
1861 年，一位巴苏托酋长的自我介绍如下：
Sorcery only exists in the mouths of those who speak it. It is no more in the power of a man to kill his fellows by mere effort of will than it would be to raise them from the dead. That is my opinion. Nevertheless, you sorcerers who hear me speak, use moderation!
巫术只存在于那些说它的人的嘴里。一个人仅仅凭借意志力就无法杀死他的同胞，就像他无法让他们从死里复活一样。这是我的意见。不过，听我讲话的巫师们，请保持节制！
A stout speech, but taking no chances. Henshaw Ward says:
言语坚定，但不抱任何侥幸心理。汉肖沃德 说：
The savage has just as good a brain as we have. If we make allowances for his small amount of information, we have to admit that his power to reason is just as great as ours. He relies on his reason. As soon as he has made a vivid mental picture of an explanation, the picture seems real. He does not distinguish between what he manufactures in his own skull and what comes to his skull from the outside world. He does not understand verifying his explanations.
野蛮人的大脑和我们一样好。如果我们考虑到他的信息量很少，我们就不得不承认他的推理能力和我们的一样强大。他依靠的是他的理性。一旦他在脑海中勾勒出一幅生动的解释图画，那幅图画就显得真实了。他不区分他在自己的头骨中制造的东西和从外部世界进入他的头骨的东西。他不明白验证他的解释。
A savage has little knowledge of natural causes. Tribes exist to whom the part played by the father in the conception of a child is unknown. It is held that a demon enters into the mother’s womb. It is not quite fair to call savages superstitious in such cases, for no better explanations are available.
野蛮人对自然原因知之甚少。对于某些部落来说，父亲在孩子的孕育过程中所扮演的角色是未知的。据认为，恶魔进入了母亲的子宫。在这种情况下，称野蛮人迷信是不太公平的，因为没有更好的解释。
ORIGINS AND GROWTH OF LANGUAGE
语言的起源和发展
Theories as to the origin of language are interesting, but they are probably beyond the test of operation and so remain unverified hypotheses. Four theories have been advanced which philologists, in flippant moments, have characterized as:
关于语言起源的理论很有趣，但它们可能超出了操作测试，因此仍然是未经验证的假设。语言学家们轻率地提出了四种理论，将其描述为：
The bow-wow theory: words as imitating sounds of animals.
弓哇理论：词语模仿动物的声音。
The pooh-pooh theory: language as developed from exclamations.
呸呸理论：语言是从感叹词发展而来的。
The ding-dong theory: words originating from harmony between sound and sense, as in “buzz” and “crack.”
叮咚理论：源自声音和意义和谐的词语，如“buzz”和“crack”。
The yo-he-ho theory: cries in common muscular effort, as in sailors’ chanteys.
哟呵呵呵理论：在共同的肌肉力量中哭泣，就像水手的口号一样。
Men, like animals, find meaning from the Thingumbobs of past experience and “know” without speaking. A farmer may work all day in the fields taking meaning from every side and say no more than “Giddap” and “Drat it!” He feels that awareness to which Korzybski so often refers as meaning that lies below the threshold of language. Man, alone of the animals, can attach a standardized sound symbol to that awareness.
人就像动物一样，从过去经验的事物中寻找意义，并且无需言语即可“知道”。农民可能整天在田里干活，从各个方面获取意义，最多只会说“天哪”和“该死！”他认为科尔日布斯基经常所说的意识是位于语言门槛以下的意义。人类是所有动物中唯一能够将标准化的声音符号附加到这种意识上的。
When baseball was being developed, participants in the game knew perfectly well the function of the man who threw the ball over the plate, but had no name for him. At first, he was probably described as “the man who throws,” “the man who pitches,” and finally, to save time all around, “the pitcher.” English had a new word. It might have been “thrower,” it might have been “yowser,” it might have been “X.” If “yowser” seems farfetched, what do you make of the real baseball term “bunt” for a short hit? Any sound symbol will do, although some are perhaps easier to get used to than others. A game of anagrams quickly instructs one in the almost endless combinations of five or six letters into pronounceable words, most of them as yet unutilized. Start with wield. Go on to WIDEL, WELID, WEDIL, DEWLI, DIWEL, LEWID. . . .
当棒球发展起来时，比赛参与者非常清楚将球扔过本垒板的人的作用，但不知道他的名字。起初，他可能被描述为“投掷的人”、“投球的人”，最后，为了节省时间，他被描述为“投手”。英语有了一个新词。它可能是“投掷者”，可能是“yowser”，也可能是“X”。如果“yowser”看起来有些牵强，那么你如何看待真正的棒球术语“短击”（短击）？任何声音符号都可以，尽管有些符号可能比其他符号更容易习惯。字谜游戏可以快速指导人们将几乎无穷无尽的五六个字母组合成可发音的单词，其中大多数尚未使用。从挥舞开始。继续 WIDEL、WELID、WEDIL、DEWLI、DIWEL、LEWID。 。 。 。
Here are a man, a woman, and a baby in an adobe hut in the mountains of Mexico. The woman has awakened, nursed the baby, and pounded corn for the morning’s breakfast of tortillas. The man is still asleep on his serape in the corner. The woman is hungry. She needs water for the tortillas, but cannot leave the baby. The spring is a quarter of a mile away. This is a concrete situation, such as Malinowski speaks of. Action is demanded. Let us apply various language tests to it.
这是墨西哥山区一间土坯小屋里的一个男人、一个女人和一个婴儿。女人已经醒来，给婴儿喂奶，并捣碎玉米作为早餐玉米饼。那个男人还在角落里的披肩上睡着了。女人饿了。她需要水来做玉米饼，但又不能离开孩子。泉水距此四分之一英里。这是马林诺夫斯基所说的具体情况。需要采取行动。让我们对其应用各种语言测试。
First we will suppose that this Indian family has gesture language only. What must the woman do? She must put down the baby, go over to the man, shake him, and beckon him over to the hearth. Then she must point to the ground corn, the empty water jar, the spring, and rub her stomach to show that she is hungry. She must point to the baby and shake her head, indicating that she cannot now fetch the water herself. This is good meaning and will solve the situation, but it takes time and effort.
首先我们假设这个印度家庭只有手势语言。女人必须做什么？她必须放下婴儿，走到那个男人身边，摇晃他，示意他到壁炉边。然后她必须指着地面上的玉米、空水罐、泉水，并揉搓自己的肚子，以表示她饿了。她必须指着婴儿摇摇头，表示她现在不能自己去打水。这是好的意思，可以解决问题，但是需要时间和精力。
Now we will bring language into the context. The woman, holding the baby, looks over from the hearth comer to the sleeping man and cries, “Pedro! Water! Quick!” We may not know how man originated language, but this little story leaves no doubt as to why it was a useful step to take.
现在我们将把语言带入上下文中。那个女人抱着婴儿，从壁炉角望向熟睡的男人，喊道：“佩德罗！水！快的！”我们可能不知道人类是如何起源语言的，但这个小故事毫无疑问地说明了为什么这是一个有用的步骤。
We may also draw an intermediate picture. The family have words but no word as yet for water. The woman can still save time, but not so much. She must say, “Pedro! Go and get some of the cold, colorless, liquid stuff we use for mixing tortillas.” This serves to illustrate the point that any language will tend to grow until there is an adequate symbol for every common act or object—until the gaps are filled. Thus instead of a long description about studies into human communication and the meaning of language, we fill the gap with a new symbol—semantics.
我们也可以画一个中间图。家人有话要说，但还没有关于水的消息。女人仍然可以节省时间，但幅度不大。她必须说：“佩德罗！去拿一些我们用来混合玉米饼的冷的、无色的液体。”这说明了这样一个观点：任何语言都会趋向于发展，直到每一个常见的行为或物体都有足够的符号——直到空白被填补。因此，我们不再对人类交流和语言意义的研究进行冗长的描述，而是用一个新的符号——语义学来填补空白。
Some authorities hold that the speech centers of the brain are a development of gesture centers. When children are learning to write, they sometimes twist their tongues. Some bushmen have such an incomplete vocabulary that they need gestures constantly to supplement their words, and cannot communicate at night. In one language the word “ni” stands for “I do it” or “you do it,” according to the gesture made. Many moderns find it difficult to use the word “spiral” without employing their hands.
一些权威人士认为，大脑的言语中枢是手势中枢的发展。当孩子们学习写作时，他们有时会扭曲舌头。有些布须曼人的词汇量不完整，需要不断地用手势来补充词汇，而且在夜间无法交流。在一种语言中，“ni”一词根据所做的手势代表“我做”或“你做”。许多现代人发现如果不用手就很难使用“螺旋”这个词。
If we listen attentively, we can hear the American language growing year by year. H. L. Mencken has admirably documented the expansion. New words are constantly appearing to fill the gaps of things we know but cannot symbolize without clumsy roundabout descriptions. The process has been going on since the first settlers landed. The new symbols come from three main sources:
如果我们用心倾听，我们可以听到美国语言逐年增长。 HL Mencken 令人钦佩地记录了这种扩张。新词不断出现，填补了我们所知道的事物的空白，但如果没有笨拙的迂回描述就无法象征。自从第一批定居者登陆以来，这个过程就一直在进行。新符号来自三个主要来源：
Importations from foreign languages, such as “rodeo,” “depot,” “sauerkraut,” “tornado,” “vigilante.”
来自外语的输入，例如“rodeo”、“depot”、“sauerkraut”、“tornado”、“vigilante”。
Slang creations, such as “jitters,” “blurb,” “palooka,” “southpaw.”
俚语创作，例如“jitters”、“blurb”、“palooka”、“southpaw”。
Technical terms, such as “static,” “speedometer,” “kilowatt,” “pulmotor,” “X-ray,” “stratosphere.”
技术术语，例如“静态”、“速度计”、“千瓦”、“脉动”、“X 射线”、“平流层”。
Before Americans adopted the word “canoe” one would have had to say “that boat with the curved sides covered with birchbark, you know, that darned Indian thing.” Before “ragtime” was invented, one would have had to say “syncopated music taken from the Negroes.” Before “automobile,” one had to speak, with many gestures, about a horseless carriage, and draw distinctions between reciprocating steam engines and internal combustion engines operated by gasoline.
在美国人采用“独木舟”这个词之前，人们不得不说“那艘船的弧形侧面覆盖着桦树皮，你知道，那该死的印第安人的东西。”在“拉格泰姆”被发明之前，人们不得不说“取自黑人的切分音音乐”。在“汽车”出现之前，人们必须用许多手势来谈论一种无马拉的马车，并区分往复式蒸汽机和汽油驱动的内燃机。
The idea to be driven home in the statements above is that we often know perfectly well without speaking, and can usually communicate that knowing by gestures -witness Harpo Marx—but that a set of symbols gives us the power greatly to increase the efficiency of communication. Unfortunately, owing to the form chosen—or rather, to the form which, like Topsy, just growed—the power sometimes works in reverse.
上述陈述要传达的理念是，我们常常不用说话就能完全了解，并且通常可以通过手势来传达这种了解 - 哈波·马克思就是见证 - 但一组符号赋予我们极大的力量来提高沟通效率。不幸的是，由于所选择的形式——或者更确切地说，由于像托普西那样刚刚成长的形式——力量有时会发挥相反的作用。
I find it difficult to believe that words have no meaning in themselves, hard as I try. Habits of a lifetime are not lightly thrown aside. The following illustration may help the reader, as it has helped me.
尽管我努力尝试，但我发现很难相信词语本身没有任何意义。一生的习惯不会轻易被抛弃。下面的插图可能对读者有帮助，就像它对我有帮助一样。
Suppose that an Englishman and a Frenchman are wrecked on a desert island. They are an exceptionally obstinate pair, one from Yorkshire and one from Provence. Each flatly refuses to learn the other’s language. Meanwhile, if they are not to die of starvation and exposure, there is hard work to be done, much of it labor in common. Gestures serve for a time, but for certain tasks words are badly needed. So they decide, by gestures, to invent a new language which is neither French nor English. Each of course knows the alphabet common to both languages. They have salvaged pencils and a pad or two of paper from the wreck. Now observe carefully what Louis and John must do.
假设一个英国人和一个法国人在荒岛上失事。他们是一对异常顽固的人，一个来自约克郡，一个来自普罗旺斯。每个人都断然拒绝学习对方的语言。与此同时，如果他们不想死于饥饿和暴晒，就需要做艰苦的工作，其中大部分是共同劳动。手势可以暂时发挥作用，但对于某些任务来说，却非常需要语言。因此，他们决定通过手势发明一种既不是法语也不是英语的新语言。当然，每个人都知道两种语言通用的字母表。他们从沉船中打捞出了铅笔和一两张纸。现在仔细观察路易斯和约翰必须做什么。
They go down to the beach and begin. John points to the sea, waving his arm to comprehend the whole expanse. Louis nods. John writes on his pad W A M, Louis nods. “Wam” is to be the word for “sea” and “mer.” John now points to the sand, takes a handful and runs it through his fingers. Louis nods and writes on his pad wap. This is all right with John. “Wap” becomes the word for sand. Then Louis points at the spring, and “waf” becomes the symbol for fresh water. And so they go round the island, making up strictly neutral words, short and easy, for all the common objects in which they are mutually interested because of the work there is to do. Then John invites Louis by gestures to look at him while he does a pantomime walk. “Rab” is the word for walk, “ral” that for run. Louis sits down and the action is symbolized as “rad.” So they invent words for all their common acts.
他们走到海滩并开始。约翰指着大海，挥动手臂以了解整个广阔的范围。路易斯点点头。约翰在便笺簿上写下“WAM”，路易斯点点头。 “Wam”是“海”和“海”的意思。约翰现在指着沙子，抓了一把，然后用手指滑过。路易斯点点头，在他的便签纸上写下。约翰对此没有意见。 “Wap”成为沙子的意思。然后路易斯指着泉水，“waf”就成了淡水的象征。因此，他们绕岛一周，为所有他们因工作要做而共同感兴趣的共同事物编造严格的中性词语，简短而简单。然后约翰用手势邀请路易斯在做哑剧行走时看着他。 “Rab”是步行的意思，“ral”是跑步的意思。路易斯坐下来，这个动作被标记为“rad”。因此，他们为所有常见的行为创造了词语。
Now the task becomes more difficult. They have a word for “tree,” but how shall they signify a collection of trees, or a wood? They work it out, perhaps by adding “ez” as a suffix. With this symbolic outfit, all duly noted on their pads and presently committed to memory, their daily labors of fishing, food-getting, cooking, shelter-building, are greatly aided. Yet not a single word means anything in itself.
现在任务变得更加困难。他们有一个词表示“树”，但它们如何表示树木的集合或树林呢？他们可能通过添加“ez”作为后缀来解决这个问题。有了这套象征性的服装，所有这些都在他们的便签本上得到了适当的记录，并且目前已经被牢记在心，他们的日常捕鱼、获取食物、烹饪、建造住所的劳动都得到了极大的帮助。然而，没有一个词本身具有任何意义。
In due time, Louis becomes lonely and wants to talk to John about his soul. But after a hurricane of French, he finds nothing to point to. He has to get along without abstractions as best he can. But with the new language, essential tasks are done, and whenever Louis and John do not clearly understand one another, they have but to point first to the nameless thing or act, and then to a word on the pad. Happy pair—they have no word for “communism” and so cannot get into an argument about it!
随着时间的推移，路易斯变得孤独，想与约翰谈论他的灵魂。但在一阵法语飓风过后，他找不到任何可以指出的地方。他必须尽可能地在没有抽象的情况下相处。但是有了新的语言，基本的任务就完成了，每当路易斯和约翰不能清楚地理解彼此时，他们只需首先指向无名的事物或行为，然后指向便签本上的一个单词。幸福的一对——他们没有“共产主义”这个词，所以不能为此争论！

第六章
PIONEERS—I
先锋——我
CHALLENGES to the validity of language are ancient, if not until recently profound. It is reported that the great Aristotle himself was occasionally uneasy at the surprising conclusions to which pure reason, uncontaminated by observation, led him. Zeno made a sardonic thrust at the absurdities of formal logic with his classic story of Achilles and the tortoise. In one’s head, employing rigorous verbal logic, the tortoise always won; in the actual world, he always lost. William of Occam (1300 A.D.) challenged the “absolutes” of the medieval philosophers. In a tactful way he razzed1 the Schoolmen, holding that “absolutes” and “universals” were mental conveniences, and that God could not be proved by words. His principle of Essentia praeter necessitatem non sunt multiplicanda—Entities are not to be multiplied beyond what is necessary—was known as Occam’s razor, because it shaved clean the fuzzy arguments of the Scholastics. William of Occam was suspect to the authorities, but happily not boiled in oil.
对语言有效性的挑战由来已久，甚至直到最近才变得深刻。据报道，伟大的亚里士多德本人有时也会对未经观察污染的纯粹理性所得出的令人惊讶的结论感到不安。芝诺用他的阿喀琉斯和乌龟的经典故事讽刺了形式逻辑的荒谬。在人们的头脑中，采用严格的语言逻辑，乌龟总是获胜；在现实世界中，他总是失败。奥卡姆的威廉（公元 1300 年）挑战了中世纪哲学家的“绝对”。他以一种巧妙的方式激怒了经院学者，认为“绝对”和“普遍”都是精神上的便利，而上帝不能用言语来证明。他的“Essentia praeter necessitatem non sunt multiplicanda”原则（实体不得增加超出必要范围）被称为奥卡姆剃刀，因为它将经院哲学的模糊论点剃得干干净净。奥卡姆的威廉受到当局的怀疑，但幸运的是没有在油中煮沸。
The Bacons, Roger about 1250 and Francis about 1600, were both skeptical of logic-chopping, and Francis was one of the principal founders of that discipline which we call the scientific method. Indeed, ever since Galileo refuted Aristotle by timing the drop of cannon balls from the top of the Tower of Pisa, scientists have been edging away from everyday language to invent new languages and new forms of logic which better describe the outside world. Jeremy Bentham, concerned as few men have been with the exact formulation of law and statute, was forced to turn his great mental powers toward the problem of semantics. Ogden, a devoted student of Bentham, unhesitatingly credits the crusty old Yorkshireman with the spark which inspired The Meaning of Meaning. Einstein, by bringing the observer into his equations and inferences, shook the language of physics to its foundations, both mathematical and verbal, and gave to both Korzybski and Bridgman a firm support.
培根夫妇（大约 1250 年的罗杰和大约 1600 年的弗朗西斯）都对逻辑切割持怀疑态度，而弗朗西斯是我们称之为科学方法的学科的主要创始人之一。事实上，自从伽利略通过计时炮弹从比萨斜塔顶部落下的时间来反驳亚里士多德以来，科学家们一直在远离日常语言，发明新的语言和新的逻辑形式，以更好地描述外部世界。杰里米·边沁（Jeremy Bentham）关心法律和法令的精确制定，他被迫将他巨大的智力转向语义问题。奥格登是边沁的忠实学生，他毫不犹豫地将启发《意义的意义》的灵感归功于这位脾气暴躁的约克郡老男人。爱因斯坦通过将观察者带入他的方程和推论中，动摇了物理学语言的数学和语言基础，并给了科日布斯基和布里奇曼坚定的支持。
I propose in this chapter and the following one to give an outline of the pioneering work of Korzybski, Ogden, Richards, Bridgman, and others. It will entail a certain amount of duplication of what has gone before. In a young and difficult study like semantics, however, it may not indicate a literary lapse to say things twice. In schooling myself, I have had to say some things a score of times to bring them home. The reader is further warned that the outline as presented is not pure Korzybski or pure Ogden, but a composite thesis, embroidered with many examples selected by myself. I am trying more to weave a fabric than to exploit personalities.
我建议在本章和下一章中概述科日布斯基、奥格登、理查兹、布里奇曼等人的开创性工作。这将需要对之前的内容进行一定程度的重复。然而，在像语义学这样的年轻而困难的研究中，说两遍可能并不意味着文学上的失误。在我自己上学的过程中，有些事情我不得不说很多次才能带回家。进一步警告读者，所提出的大纲并不是纯粹的科尔日布斯基或纯粹的奥格登，而是一篇综合论文，其中绣有我自己选择的许多例子。我更多地尝试编织一种织物，而不是利用个性。
THE GENERAL SEMANTICS OF KORZYBSKI
KORZYBSKI 的一般语义
Our remote ancestors, when language was in its infancy, gave words to sensations, feelings, emotions. Like small children, they identified those feelings with the outside world, and personified outside events. They made sensations and judgments—“heat,” “cold,” “bad,” “good”—substantives in the language structure. Though not objects, they were treated like objects. The world picture was made anthropomorphic. Sun, moon, trees, were given feelings like men, and a soul was assigned to each. In the old mythologies, gods or demons in human shape made everything with their hands. (The world was created in six days.) These remarkable concepts became rooted in the structure of language and the structure, if not the myth, remains to plague us to this day.
当语言还处于萌芽阶段时，我们的远古祖先就用语言来表达感觉、感受和情绪。就像小孩子一样，他们将这些感受与外部世界联系起来，并将外部事件人格化。他们在语言结构中做出了感觉和判断——“热”、“冷”、“坏”、“好”。虽然不是物体，但它们被当作物体对待。世界图景被拟人化了。太阳、月亮、树木，都像人一样被赋予了感情，并被赋予了灵魂。在古老的神话中，人形的神或恶魔用双手创造了一切。 （世界在六天内被创造出来。）这些非凡的概念植根于语言的结构中，而这种结构，即使不是神话，至今仍困扰着我们。
Cassius J. Keyser, writing of Korzybski in Scripta Mathematica, has well summarized the legacy of the past:
Cassius J. Keyser 在 Scripta Mathematica 中撰写了 Korzybski 的著作，很好地总结了过去的遗产：
Deeply and subtly imbedded in the structures of all existing languages are to be found many vestiges derived in the course of long ages from primitive beliefs and pre-scientific views of life and the world. These languages—because their structures are thus infected by metaphysics and myth, by innumerable objectifications of sheer abstractions, by countless identifications or confusions of the various levels of abstraction—are ill adapted, not only as instruments of scientific research and scientific communication but also, and even more unfortunately, as educational instruments for the protection, guidance, disciplining and development of children in ways most favorable to sanity and life.
在所有现有语言的结构中，我们可以发现许多在漫长岁月中源自原始信仰和前科学的生命和世界观的痕迹。这些语言——因为它们的结构因此受到形而上学和神话、无数纯粹抽象的客观化、无数不同抽象层次的识别或混淆的影响——不适应，不仅作为科学研究和科学交流的工具，而且，更不幸的是，作为以最有利于心智健全和生活的方式保护、指导、管教和发展儿童的教育工具。
A Baptist preacher, the Reverend C. E. Newton of Pittsfield, Illinois, confessed recently that he had murdered Mrs. Dennis Kelly and then thrown her body into the Mississippi River. The State’s Attorney thus described the defendant’s character: “He had very winning ways with the other sex. As he grew older he still retained an almost boyish appearance and became even more successful in his love-making. Finally he thought he could do no wrong at all and even began to identify himself with God.” To such tragedies do verbal identifications sometimes lead.
伊利诺伊州皮茨菲尔德的浸信会传教士 CE Newton 牧师最近承认，他谋杀了丹尼斯·凯利夫人，然后将她的尸体扔进了密西西比河。州检察官这样描述被告的性格：“他对异性有非常成功的方式。随着年龄的增长，他仍然保持着近乎孩子气的外表，并且在做爱方面更加成功。最后他认为自己根本不会做错事，甚至开始认同上帝。”口头认同有时会导致这样的悲剧。
Primitive language was cast in the subject-predicate form with the “is” of identity fundamental. Our ancestors called an animal “cow.” They saw another animal of similar shape and said: “This is another one of the same animal; both are cow.” When they said “the same,” they forgot the uniqueness of every object. One may observe with the eyes Bossy1 and Bossy2, but never cows-in-general. Sad experiences have occurred when Bossy3, a male of the species, was mistaken for a “cow.”
原始语言被铸成主谓形式，以“是”为基础。我们的祖先称动物为“牛”。他们看到另一只形状相似的动物，说道：“这是同一种动物的另一只；两个都是牛。”当他们说“相同”时，他们忘记了每件物品的独特性。人们可以用 Bossy1 和 Bossy2 的眼睛来观察，但绝不能用一般的奶牛来观察。当该物种的雄性 Bossy3 被误认为是“牛”时，就发生了悲伤的经历。
Is such a language reliable? Not if one is damaged by a bull. Here are three pails of water, with temperatures as indicated in the diagram. Put your left hand into pail A, and your right hand into pail C. Now withdraw the left hand from A and put it into B: “Nice warm water.” Withdraw the right hand from C and put it into B: “Brrr! beastly cold water.” There is thus no absolute thing “cold” or “warm.” The use of language to produce such substantives is false to the facts. These words cannot truly express things, but only relations. Relative to the left pail, the water in the middle pail is warm; relative to the right pail, at substantially the same time, it is cold. Relations have useful meaning; absolute warmness and coldness have none. Some writers on dynamic logic like Bogoslovsky call “heat” and “cold” polar words. To discuss the feeling of temperature the pole of heat and the pole of cold are both necessary. Similar polar words are good and bad, fast and slow, healthy and unhealthy, and so on.
这样的语言可靠吗？如果一个人被公牛伤害了就不会了。这是三桶水，温度如图所示。将左手放入 A 桶中，将右手放入 C 桶中。现在将左手从 A 中抽出，放入 B 中：“好温水。”将右手从C处收回，放到B处：“呜呜！冰冷的水。”因此，没有绝对的“冷”或“热”。使用语言产生此类实质性内容与事实不符。这些词不能真正表达事物，而只能表达关系。相对于左边的桶，中间的桶里的水是温的；相对于右边的桶，几乎同时，它是冷的。关系具有有用的意义；绝对的温暖和绝对的寒冷都没有。博戈斯洛夫斯基等一些研究动态逻辑的作家将“热”和“冷”极性词称为“极性词”。为了讨论温度的感觉，热极和冷极都是必要的。类似的极性词有好和坏、快和慢、健康和不健康等等。
Take the word “bad.” It probably arose to express a vague feeling of dislike. Rather than go to the trouble of describing the characteristics one did not like in an animal or a plot of soil, one said, “It is bad.” All right, a useful short cut. Then the word was made into a substantive, “badness.” At this abstraction level, it became something ominous and menacing in its own right. One had better not be associated with badness. Badness was incorporated into rigid standards of judgment, especially moral judgment: “This girl is bad.” The statement implies that she is wholly bad, a veritable chunk of badness. But she may also be a charming girl, kind to children, kind to her parents, and perhaps overkind to her young man. To cast her out of society as “bad” is the result of a false, one-valued or two-valued appraisal. Adequately to judge this girl, we must make a many-valued appraisal; we must know her other characteristics, the circumstances of the environment in which she was brought up, the status of the moral code at the place and time of the alleged badness, and something about the economic and social prejudices of the judge who calls her “bad.”
就拿“坏”这个词来说吧。这可能是为了表达一种模糊的不喜欢的感觉。有人不厌其烦地描述人们不喜欢的动物或土地的特征，而是说：“这很糟糕。”好吧，一个有用的捷径。然后这个词就变成了实质性的“badness”。在这个抽象层面上，它本身就变成了不祥和危险的东西。一个人最好不要与坏事联系在一起。坏被纳入严格的判断标准，尤其是道德判断：“这个女孩很坏。”这句话暗示她完全是坏人，是名副其实的坏人。但她也可能是一个迷人的女孩，对孩子友善，对父母友善，也许对她的年轻人过于友善。将她视为“坏人”而将她驱逐出社会是错误的、单值或双值评价的结果。要充分评价这个女孩，我们必须做出多方面的评价；我们必须了解她的其他特征、她成长的环境、被指控的不良行为发生的地点和时间的道德准则状况，以及称她为“恶人”的法官的经济和社会偏见。坏的。”
Here is a boy who will not get up in the morning. His parents conclude that he is “lazy.” “Laziness,” as a substantive, is akin to “badness” in the American folkways. The boy receives the harsh treatment which laziness warrants, and presently becomes deranged and unmanageable. Fortunately at this point a doctor is called in. As a scientist he discounts verbal judgments and proceeds to a careful examination. He finds the patient’s glands seriously out of order. The condition is corrected, and the boy gets up in the morning. By identifying their son with “laziness,” the parents had almost wrecked his life. Think of the catastrophic judgments being passed right and left upon persons who are “poor,” “dirty,” “ungrateful,” “undesirables,” “ignorant foreigners,” “reds,” “Babbitts,” “rich,” “capitalists,” “bosses,” “niggers,” “greasers.”
这是一个早上起不来的男孩。他的父母得出结论，他“懒惰”。 “懒惰”作为一个实体，类似于美国民俗中的“坏”。男孩因懒惰而受到严厉的对待，不久就变得精神错乱、无法控制。幸运的是，此时一位医生被叫来了。作为一名科学家，他不顾口头判断，而是进行了仔细的检查。他发现病人的腺体严重失调。病情得到纠正，男孩早上就起床了。由于认为儿子“懒惰”，这对父母几乎毁了他的生活。想想那些“穷人”、“肮脏”、“忘恩负义”、“不受欢迎的人”、“无知的外国人”、“红色分子”、“巴比特”、“富人”、“资本家”、 ”“老板”、“黑鬼”、“油腻腻的人”。
I bring this point in early to show that Korzybski, in his semantic analysis, often indicates a standard of judgment which we have long associated with toleration toward our fellow creatures and kindness in our treatment of them. He adopts this standard not because he is inspired with “love for humanity,” but because it is the conclusion which the facts seem to warrant. Wholly bad girls and lazy boys are not to be found anywhere except in our own heads.
我早先提出这一点是为了表明，科尔日布斯基在他的语义分析中经常表明一种判断标准，我们长期以来一直将这种判断标准与对我们的同胞的宽容和对待他们的仁慈联系在一起。他采用这个标准并不是因为他受到“对人类的爱”的启发，而是因为这是事实似乎证明的结论。除了我们自己的头脑之外，在任何地方都找不到完全的坏女孩和懒惰的男孩。
The world outside has a certain structure. Knowledge of that world—what it means to us—should be in terms of structure rather than in terms of separate chunks and substantives. We have already noted how “iron” dissolved into a different concept at the submicroscopic level. “Structure” is a term frequently employed by Korzybski. Think of a skyscraper, or better, go and look at one while it is being erected. A pile of steel girders on a truck does not constitute a skyscraper. To get a durable structure, we must establish definite relations between struts and girders in a definite order. Relations, order, structure. Astronomers do not derive their knowledge of the sun from studying its surface exclusively. They acquire useful knowledge by studying the sun’s relation to earth, planets, moon, and the order of those relations, as reflected in day, night, seasons, solar year. The relations of light and gravitation are also cardinal for knowledge about the sun, while the relation of living things to the sun is the most important fact in their lives. Let it be extinguished, and in a few minutes thereafter they too are extinguished. Scientists turn increasingly to structure in their search for knowledge and in their explanation of the facts observed.
外部世界有一定的结构。关于那个世界的知识——它对我们意味着什么——应该是在结构方面，而不是在单独的块和实体方面。我们已经注意到“铁”如何在亚微观层面溶解成不同的概念。 “结构”是科日布斯基经常使用的术语。想象一座摩天大楼，或者更好的是，去看看一座正在建造的摩天大楼。卡车上的一堆钢梁并不能构成摩天大楼。为了获得耐用的结构，我们必须按照明确的顺序在支柱和梁之间建立明确的关系。关系、顺序、结构。天文学家并不是通过专门研究太阳的表面来获得对太阳的了解。他们通过研究太阳与地球、行星、月亮的关系以及这些关系的顺序（如白天、夜晚、季节、太阳年所反映的顺序）来获得有用的知识。光和引力的关系对于了解太阳也是至关重要的，而生物与太阳的关系则是它们生命中最重要的事实。让它熄灭，几分钟后它们也熄灭了。科学家在寻求知识和解释观察到的事实时越来越多地转向结构。
Korzybski takes a structural view of the human nervous system. Although its structure is too complex to understand fully in detail, its orderly functioning depends on the direction of messages around the nerve circuits, as explained in Chapter 3. When this direction is reversed by physical injury or, as Korzybski believes, by bad language, the organism becomes mentally unbalanced, mentally “disordered.” Human beings obey laws of structure as does the outside world—which makes sense, for they are part of it.
科日布斯基对人类神经系统的结构进行了研究。尽管它的结构太复杂，无法完全详细地理解，但它的有序功能取决于神经回路周围信息的方向，如第 3 章所述。当这个方向因身体伤害或正如科日布斯基认为的脏话而逆转时，有机体变得精神不平衡，精神“紊乱”。人类和外部世界一样遵守结构法则——这是有道理的，因为他们是外部世界的一部分。
If we wish to understand the world and ourselves, it follows that we should use a language whose structure corresponds to physical structure. To this cardinal point Korzybski returns again and again. He cites the helpful illustration of a map. One cannot climb mountains or drive motorcars on a map, but it is a mighty useful aid in both activities. To be an aid, the map must be accurate; it must have a structure similar to the territory on which we are to walk or drive. The trails and roads must bear similar relations, the towns must come in similar order, to the actual trails, roads, and towns. If the order of three cities going south is Montreal, New York, Miami, and the map shows Montreal, Miami, New York, our journey is likely to be a fiasco. I once followed a mountain-trail map to an indicated good camping-place which turned out to be a swamp. It cost me a night of mosquitoes and misery.
如果我们希望了解世界和我们自己，那么我们就应该使用一种结构与物理结构相对应的语言。科尔日布斯基一次又一次地谈到了这一点。他引用了一张有用的地图插图。人们无法爬山或在地图上驾驶汽车，但它对这两项活动都是非常有用的帮助。作为辅助工具，地图必须准确；它必须具有与我们行走或驾驶的区域类似的结构。小径和道路必须具有相似的关系，城镇必须以相似的顺序出现，以达到实际的小径、道路和城镇。如果向南的三个城市的顺序是蒙特利尔、纽约、迈阿密，而地图上显示的是蒙特利尔、迈阿密、纽约，那么我们的旅程很可能会惨败。有一次，我沿着山路地图找到了一个标明的露营地，结果发现那里是一片沼泽。这让我度过了一个充满蚊子和痛苦的夜晚。
As we have seen, most languages (English, French, German, what you will) with their equating verb “to be,” their false identifications, spurious substantives, confused levels of abstractions, and one-valued judgments, are structurally dissimilar to our nervous system and our environment. The effect is like a bone crosswise in the throat. We get orders and levels tangled up; we misunderstand and misinterpret relations.
正如我们所看到的，大多数语言（英语、法语、德语，等等）的等同动词“to be”、错误的识别、虚假的实词、混乱的抽象层次和单值判断，在结构上与我们的语言不同。神经系统和我们的环境。其效果就像一根骨头横插在喉咙里。我们的订单和水平纠缠在一起；我们误解并曲解了关系。
There is, however, one language which is capable of expressing the structural relations found in the known world and in the nervous system. It is used with equal facility by a Japanese, a Russian, a Chilean, or an American. The name of this useful, well-ordered language is mathematics. I dislike testimonials, but honesty seems to demand them in this subject, and here is a testimonial on mathematics. Convinced by Korzybski that an understanding of mathematics improves communication, I bought a little book, Calculus Made Easy by S. P. Thompson, and set to work. In a few days of hard sweating I brushed up what higher mathematics I had learned in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I mastered the general concept of the differential calculus, and worked through a few problems. Then I returned to Korzybski’s account of Einstein. For the first time in my life, and in wild excitement, I caught a genuine glimmer of the meaning of “relativity.” It was not a matter of words; it was an inner meaning. I think it safe to say that no language but mathematics could have given me this light.
然而，有一种语言能够表达已知世界和神经系统中的结构关系。日本人、俄罗斯人、智利人或美国人都可以同样轻松地使用它。这种有用的、秩序井然的语言的名字是数学。我不喜欢推荐，但在这个主题上似乎需要诚实，这是一个关于数学的推荐。科尔兹布斯基相信，对数学的理解可以改善沟通，我买了一本小书，SP Thompson 的《微积分变得简单》，然后开始工作。经过几天的努力，我把在麻省理工学院学到的高等数学温习了一遍。我掌握了微分学的一般概念，并解决了一些问题。然后我又回到科尔日布斯基对爱因斯坦的描述。我有生以来第一次在极度兴奋中看到了“相对论”的真正含义。这不是言语的问题，而是言语的问题。这是一种内在的意义。我认为可以肯定地说，除了数学之外，没有任何语言可以给我这种启发。
We cannot all turn mathematicians—indeed, mathematics as communication has limitations of its own—but our great need is an everyday language with a form similar to the structure of the nervous system and the environment. If we habitually employ a language dissimilar to the world and to our nervous system, it is manifestly difficult to know and to communicate what is going on about us.
我们不可能都成为数学家——事实上，数学作为交流有其自身的局限性——但我们最大的需要是一种形式类似于神经系统和环境结构的日常语言。如果我们习惯性地使用与世界和我们的神经系统不同的语言，那么显然很难了解和交流我们周围发生的事情。
The concept of structure and structural relations is applicable wherever we look. One reason why the American labor organization known as the C.I.O. succeeded in certain situations where the A.F. of L. failed is that its structure corresponded more closely to the structure of the industry it was attempting to organize. The structure of the A.F. of L. was, and is, out of line with the structure of modern industries devoted to mass production.
结构和结构关系的概念无论在哪里都适用。被称为 CIO 的美国劳工组织在 L. 的 AF 失败的某些情况下取得成功的原因之一是，其结构与其试图组织的行业结构更加接近。 L. 的 AF 结构无论过去还是现在都与致力于大规模生产的现代工业结构格格不入。
Specifically what does Korzybski propose? He proposes:
科日布斯基具体提出了什么建议？他建议：
1. A better general understanding of mathematics as an aid in grasping the relations of things and analyzing situations.
1. 更好地理解数学，有助于掌握事物之间的关系和分析情况。
2. A constant attempt to avoid identification. One should handle the little word “is” as carefully as a stick of dynamite. The word is not the thing.
2. 不断试图避免被认出。人们应该像对待一根炸药一样小心地对待“是”这个小词。词不是事。
3. A constant attempt not to employ high-order abstractions except consciously, with full knowledge of what level of abstraction one is on. When one says—as I have often said—“We must plan with nature for the protection of natural resources,” one must be conscious that there is no entity “nature,” an old mother with whom one has interviews, but that the word is only a useful tag for summing up a great variety ot natural processes: the hydrologic cycle, soil formation, wind and storm, plant life, animal life, and so on.
3. 不断尝试不使用高阶抽象，除非有意识地充分了解自己所处的抽象级别。当人们说——正如我经常说的——“我们必须与自然一起规划以保护自然资源”时，我们必须意识到，不存在“自然”实体，即采访一位老母亲，但这个词只是一个总结各种自然过程的有用标签：水文循环、土壤形成、风和风暴、植物生命、动物生命等等。
4. The use of a little model, called somewhat ominously a “structural differential,” as an aid in reshaping language habits. At first blush, the model looks and sounds foolish. It is interesting to learn, however, that Dr. P. S. Graven of Washington has cured mental patients with its help. It gives no aid, of course, when mental disorders have arisen from physical causes, but it does appear to be helpful in removing semantic blockages. Meanwhile the use of the structural differential in controlled experiments in schools shows a definite raising of I.Q. levels of groups of children.1
4. 使用一个小模型（有点不祥地称为“结构差异”）来帮助重塑语言习惯。乍一看，这个模型看起来和听起来都很愚蠢。然而，有趣的是，华盛顿的 PS Graven 博士在它的帮助下治愈了精神病人。当然，当精神障碍是由身体原因引起时，它没有任何帮助，但它似乎确实有助于消除语义障碍。同时，在学校的对照实验中使用结构差异表明，儿童群体的智商水平得到了明确的提高。1
The model consists of metal or wooden tags which hang on a frame, in the order shown on the accompanying diagram. By pointing to the various levels, by handling the tags with one’s fingers, by recognizing the characteristics left out as one travels the abstraction scale, the manipulator learns correct semantic reactions. It sounds queer, but apparently it works.
该模型由悬挂在框架上的金属或木制标签组成，按照附图所示的顺序。通过指向各个级别，通过用手指处理标签，通过识别在抽象尺度上移动时遗漏的特征，操纵器可以学习正确的语义反应。这听起来很奇怪，但显然它确实有效。
Let us take any object and follow it through the various levels on the diagram. Here, for instance, is this pencil with which I write. At the submicroscopic level of the “event,” as noted earlier, it is a mad dance of electrons. An event is a process which does not stop and to the best of our knowledge does not repeat itself, and to which we can ascribe an indefinitely great number of characteristics. Note the phrase “indefinitely great.”
让我们选取任何对象并按照它完成图表中的各个级别。例如，这是我用来写字的铅笔。如前所述，在“事件”的亚微观层面上，这是电子的疯狂舞蹈。事件是一个不会停止的过程，据我们所知，它不会重复，并且我们可以为其赋予无限多的特征。请注意“无限伟大”这句话。
It is as near to “infinity” as many modern physicists dare approach.
它是许多现代物理学家敢于接近的“无穷大”。
At the next level, the object is of finite size. Its characteristics are many but not indefinitely great. It can be apprehended by the senses, as the event cannot. Hobie Baker recognizes a pencil after experience (at least he loves to knock it on the floor) but he gives no name to it. Human beings give it a label. The label varies with different languages. In Russian, “pencil” becomes “ka-randash.” The nervous system abstracts the object from the event, dropping out many characteristics in the process. The human being gives the object a name, abstraction number two. A statement may then be made about it: “This pencil is six inches long” or “This pencil has a soft point.” Those statements or descriptions are abstractions of the third order. We might then say, “Long pencils are better than short ones” and go on to the fourth order. At this point we begin to think about pencils-in-general—short pencils, long pencils, pencils-as-a-class. From here abstractions can break out in all directions. Let us set up one series where the abstractions become of a higher order, and so increasingly remote from the object clutched between my fingers.
在下一个级别，对象的大小是有限的。它的特点很多，但并不是无限的。它可以被感官所理解，而事件却不能。霍比·贝克（Hobie Baker）在经历过之后认出了一支铅笔（至少他喜欢把它敲到地板上），但他没有给出它的名称。人类给它贴上了标签。不同语言的标签有所不同。在俄语中，“铅笔”变成“ka-randash”。神经系统从事件中抽象出对象，并在此过程中丢弃许多特征。人类给物体起了一个名字，第二个抽象。然后可以对此进行陈述：“这支铅笔有六英寸长”或“这支铅笔有一个软点”。这些陈述或描述是第三阶的抽象。然后我们可能会说，“长铅笔比短铅笔好”，然后继续第四个顺序。此时，我们开始考虑一般铅笔——短铅笔、长铅笔、铅笔作为一类。从这里开始，抽象可以向各个方向爆发。让我们建立一个系列，其中抽象变得更高阶，并且越来越远离我手指间抓着的物体。
The event.
事件。
The object—nonverbal at this level. (Ogden and Richards call it the “referent.”)
客体——在这个层面上是非语言的。 （奥格登和理查兹称之为“参照物”。）
The word “pencil.” (Called a “label” by Korzybski,” a “symbol” by Ogden and Richards.)
“铅笔”这个词。 （科日布斯基称之为“标签”，奥格登和理查兹称之为“符号”。）
Description of this pencil.
这支铅笔的描述。
Pencils-as-a-class.
铅笔作为一类。
Pencils as household equipment along with chairs and tables.
铅笔作为家用设备以及椅子和桌子。
Pencils as part of the term “shelter,” as distinguished from clothing.
铅笔是“庇护所”一词的一部分，与服装不同。
Pencils as part of the term “standard of living.”
铅笔是“生活水平”一词的一部分。
Pencils as part of the term “economic goods.”
铅笔作为“经济商品”一词的一部分。
Pencils as part of the term “production.”
铅笔作为术语“生产”的一部分。
Pencils as part of the term “capitalism.”
铅笔是“资本主义”一词的一部分。
Pencils as part of the term “Western civilization.”
铅笔是“西方文明”一词的一部分。
Pencils as part of the term “human culture.”
铅笔是“人类文化”一词的一部分。
On, on, on. Observe how remote from the object “capitalism” lies—a misty abstraction far from the concrete pencils, loaves of bread, wheelbarrows, bank checks, and dynamos which constitute the lower-order referents and in the end give meaning, if any, to the term. Observe the great difficulty of any two persons’ agreeing on a referent, or a series of referents, for the label “capitalism.” Yet without such agreement, capitalism cannot be intelligently discussed. Failing meaningful discussions, the main result of using the term in argument is to stir emotions. Obviously such emotions will be random, undirected, and blind, governed by each de bater’s mental image of the abstraction.
开，开，开。观察一下“资本主义”离这个对象有多远——一个模糊的抽象，远离具体的铅笔、面包、手推车、银行支票和发电机，它们构成了低阶的指涉物，并最终赋予了意义（如果有的话）。学期。观察一下任何两个人就“资本主义”这个标签的一个或一系列指称达成一致是多么困难。然而，如果没有这样的共识，就无法明智地讨论资本主义。如果无法进行有意义的讨论，在争论中使用该术语的主要结果就是煽动情绪。显然，这种情绪是随机的、无方向的和盲目的，受到每个辩论者对抽象概念的心理形象的控制。
When we say that the label “is” the object, we confuse two abstraction levels. A child using the model fingers the separate metal or wooden tags and notes that the second tag is not the third. This physical handling stamps the distinction between word and thing firmly into his mind.
当我们说标签“是”对象时，我们混淆了两个抽象级别。使用模型的孩子用手指触摸单独的金属或木制标签，并注意到第二个标签不是第三个标签。这种物理处理将词语与事物之间的区别牢牢地印在了他的脑海中。
Douglas G. Campbell, M.D., and C. B. Congdon, M.D., psychiatrists at the University of Chicago, reported in 1937 in respect to their use of the Korzybski technique in part as follows:
芝加哥大学精神病学家 Douglas G. Campbell（医学博士）和 CB Congdon（医学博士）于 1937 年报告了他们对 Korzybski 技术的使用，部分内容如下：
General Semantics is useful in handling cases not reached by other methods. Under purely verbalistic management some patients cannot be reached. In such cases the semantic approach, as we have used it, has been astonishingly successful. In many cases the response of the patient has been not only sudden but dramatic, surprising us as therapists. . . . The elimination of a single identification, based on false-to-facts knowledge, doctrinal in origin, has often in our experience greatly relieved if not cured many painful situations of long standing. . . . Sleeplessness, anxiety states, depressions and hypochondriacal symptoms yield more quickly, we feel, than by use of the older methods. . . . We are surprised by our results with schizophrenics, where, in a few cases, it has been possible to clear up the disturbing effects of hallucinations and delusions. . . . We are coming to the conclusion that a combination of group and private instruction, or therapy, will evolve. There is no doubt that we have in General Semantics a procedure of great merit in preventive work utilizable in the elementary schools as well as in the colleges.
通用语义对于处理其他方法无法达到的情况很有用。在纯粹的口头管理下，有些患者无法联系到。在这种情况下，我们所使用的语义方法取得了惊人的成功。在许多情况下，病人的反应不仅是突然的，而且是戏剧性的，让我们作为治疗师感到惊讶。 。 。 。根据我们的经验，消除基于虚假事实知识、起源于教义的单一识别，即使不能治愈许多长期存在的痛苦情况，也常常能大大缓解这种情况。 。 。 。我们认为，与使用旧方法相比，失眠、焦虑状态、抑郁和疑病症症状的缓解速度更快。 。 。 。我们对精神分裂症的研究结果感到惊讶，在少数情况下，可以消除幻觉和妄想的令人不安的影响。 。 。 。我们得出的结论是，团体和私人指导或治疗的结合将会发展。毫无疑问，我们在一般语义学中拥有一个在预防工作中具有巨大价值的程序，可在小学和大学中使用。
A research chemist has supplied me with an excellent example of the proclivity to identify name with thing. He was employed by a large manufacturer of starch. A single grade of starch was milled to varying degrees of fineness, of which the most expensive bore a brand name which I will call Queen. Subsequently he was called in by a candy manufacturer who used great quantities of Queen starch to make glucose. The chemist told the management that a cheaper starch than Queen could be used without changing the quality of the candy or its chemical analysis. The management promptly acted upon his suggestion. Thereupon the morale of the factory went to pieces. Foremen and workers were convinced that the new starch was inferior, and bad for the candy. Output fell, labor costs increased, batches were spoiled, misunderstandings developed. My chemist was an unconscious student of semantics. He obtained a number of old Queen cartons and poured in the new and cheaper starch. The workers saw the label and were reassured. Output promptly returned to normal. The label, the word “Queen,” had made the difference. The working force of the factory had confused their orders of abstraction and mistaken the name for the thing.
一位研究化学家为我提供了一个很好的例子，说明人们倾向于将名称与事物等同起来。他受雇于一家大型淀粉制造商。单一等级的淀粉被研磨成不同程度的细度，其中最昂贵的淀粉有一个我称之为女王的品牌名称。随后，一家糖果制造商请了他，该制造商使用大量皇后淀粉来制造葡萄糖。化学家告诉管理层，可以使用比皇后更便宜的淀粉，而不会改变糖果的质量或其化学分析。管理层立即按照他的建议采取了行动。于是，工厂的士气彻底崩溃了。工头和工人确信新淀粉质量较差，对糖果不利。产量下降，劳动力成本增加，批次变质，产生误解。我的化学家是一个无意识的语义学学生。他买了一些旧的皇后纸盒，倒入新的、更便宜的淀粉。工人们看到标签，就放心了。输出很快恢复正常。 “女王”这个词的标签产生了影响。工厂的工人混淆了他们的抽象顺序，并将名称误认为是事物。
Identification of word with thing suggests various questions over which men have debated with vigor and passion for thousands of years.
将词语与事物等同起来意味着人们几千年来一直在激烈而热情地争论的各种问题。
What is life? What is Hell?
生活是什么？什么是地狱？
What is space? What is Heaven?
什么是空间？什么是天堂？
What is time? What is good?
时间是什么？什么是好的？
The answer, of course, is zero, nothing, no such animal, inside your own skin but unreported elsewhere. Living things are reported, but no “life”; good deeds are reported, but no “good.” Irritants, Korzybski calls these questions. In a given context a statement may be true or false, but there is no such entity as “truth.” “Tell the truth” does not mean to utter eternal sublimities, but to tell what happened when you ran off the road in your car on Tuesday the twenty-sixth at 10:45 a.m.
答案当然是零，什么都没有，没有这样的动物，在你自己的皮肤里，但在其他地方没有报道过。报道了生物，但没有“生命”；善行被报道，但没有“善行”。科日布斯基称这些问题令人恼火。在给定的上下文中，一个陈述可能是真或假，但不存在“真理”这样的实体。 “说实话”并不意味着说出永恒的崇高，而是讲述当你在二十六号星期二上午 10:45 开车冲出道路时发生的事情
Not only is the label mistaken for the object but description (level four) is confused with inference (level five). This leads to more communication failure.
不仅标签被误认为是对象，而且描述（第四级）也与推理（第五级）混淆。这会导致更多的沟通失败。
Stags run fast.
雄鹿跑得很快。
Some Indians run fast.
有些印度人跑得很快。
Some Indians are stags.
有些印度人是雄鹿。
The first two lines are descriptions and true enough. The last is a confusion of inference and description very common among primitive peoples. Human beings tend to prefer inferences to impersonal descriptions, because they are more dynamic and emotional. We turn the sun and the moon into gods long before we dispassionately record their motions. The reason the scientific method is so disquieting to many laymen is that it holds to descriptions first, to inferences, if any, next. It keeps its orders clear.
前两行是描述并且足够真实。最后一个是原始民族中很常见的推理和描述的混乱。人类往往更喜欢推论而不是客观的描述，因为它们更具活力和情感。早在我们冷静地记录太阳和月亮的运动之前，我们就已经把它们变成了神。科学方法之所以令许多外行人如此不安，是因为它首先坚持描述，然后才是推论（如果有的话）。它保持命令清晰。
John asks, “How would you define a corporation?”
约翰问：“你如何定义公司？”
Tom answers, “A corporation is a legal device for avoiding personal responsibility and plundering the public.”
汤姆回答说：“公司是逃避个人责任和掠夺公众的合法手段。”
Observe the confusion here. Tom makes two statements in one. The legal responsibility is a verifiable description; plundering the public is an inference. He lumps the two together, and both John and Tom believe erroneously that a definition is being given. Instances of such confusions are very numerous. They take the general form:
观察这里的混乱。汤姆将两句话合二为一。法律责任是可验证的描述；掠夺大众是一种推论。他将两者混为一谈，约翰和汤姆都错误地认为给出了定义。这种混淆的例子很多。它们采用一般形式：
What is X?
X是什么？
X is a hell of a thing or
X 是一件很糟糕的事或者
X is a fine thing.
X是个好东西。
The objective characteristics of X are not disclosed.
X的客观特征并未公开。
To be conscious of abstracting is to know what level you arc on, and what characteristics are left out at that level. The event has characteristics indefinitely great, while pencils-as-a-class has very few. About all that one can say about pencils in general is that they symbolize objects which (1) are longer than they are broad, (2) will make a mark. If one is unconscious of abstracting, he gives to words a definite, one-valued meaning—“She is a bad girl, with no ifs, ands, or buts.” He interprets another person’s speech as always having that meaning. His reactions tend to be hasty and emotional, largely from the thalamus region. He jumps down your throat with “You’re wrong!” He is full of ultimate truths and eternal principles. With abstractions fixed as entities rather than consciously recognized as verbal tags, we begin to worry about “worry,” and develop a fear of “fear.” A hospital for nervous diseases looms not far ahead. Belief in “belief’ meanwhile leads to fanaticism and dogmatism.
意识到抽象就是知道你处于哪个级别，以及该级别遗漏了哪些特征。该活动具有无限的伟大特征，而铅笔作为一类则很少。关于铅笔，人们通常可以说的是，它们象征着以下物体：（1）长度大于宽度，（2）可以做标记。如果一个人没有意识到抽象，他就会赋予词语一种明确的、单值的含义——“她是一个坏女孩，没有如果、和或但是。”他将另一个人的讲话解释为始终具有这种含义。他的反应往往是仓促和情绪化的，主要来自丘脑区域。他从你的喉咙里跳出来说：“你错了！”他充满了终极真理和永恒原则。由于抽象被固定为实体而不是有意识地识别为语言标签，我们开始担心“担心”，并产生对“恐惧”的恐惧。一家治疗神经疾病的医院就在前方不远处。同时，对“信仰”的信仰会导致狂热和教条主义。
Young men and women make an entity out of the abstraction “marriage,” conceiving it to be an actual state blissful beyond imagining. When they marry, the resulting shock is needlessly great. “Heaven” is less devastating, because its devotees can file no later reports—except in spook parlors. Boys in 1917 who expected war to be a horrible business suffered less from shell shock, according to Korzybski, than those suffused with “glory,” “patriotism,” and a “battle for democracy.”
年轻男女从抽象的“婚姻”中创造出一个实体，将其视为一种超乎想象的幸福的实际状态。当他们结婚时，所产生的震惊是不必要的巨大。 “天堂”的破坏性较小，因为它的信徒不能提交任何后续报告——除了在幽灵室。科尔兹布斯基表示，1917 年，那些认为战争是一件可怕事情的男孩，与那些充满“荣耀”、“爱国主义”和“民主之战”的男孩相比，受到炮弹休克的影响要小一些。
Observe that in the semantic approach to abstractions there is no plea to “think things through”—the stock retort of one dogmatist to another. “Thinking things through” has heretofore largely meant more useless mental labor—from thought to word and back to thought again. Here, on the contrary, we are trying to find the object, the referent to which the thought and word refer, and after that to discover its attributes and relationships. This means a new discipline in many fields, a tearing-down of the scaffold of what has passed for thought and building afresh.
请注意，在抽象的语义方法中，没有恳求“彻底思考问题”——这是一个教条主义者对另一个教条主义者的惯用反驳。迄今为止，“彻底思考”在很大程度上意味着更多无用的脑力劳动——从思想到文字，再回到思想。相反，在这里，我们试图找到思想和词语所指涉的对象、所指对象，然后发现其属性和关系。这意味着许多领域的新学科，拆除过去思想的脚手架并重新构建。
The structure of language inherited from our primitive ancestors is such that it provides separate terms for factors which are inseparable in fact. “Matter,” “space,” “time,” constitute one such group; “body,” “mind,” constitute another. We thus try to split in our heads what is unsplittable in the real world. A college boy I know reports that he and a group of friends sat up all one night in 1937 furiously arguing the question, “If there were no matter in space would time go on?” Obviously there cannot be:
从我们的原始祖先继承下来的语言结构是这样的，它为事实上不可分割的因素提供了单独的术语。 “物质”、“空间”、“时间”构成了这样的一组； “身”、“心”构成了另一个。因此，我们试图在头脑中分裂现实世界中不可分裂的东西。我认识的一位大学生报告说，1937 年，他和一群朋友彻夜不眠地激烈争论这个问题：“如果太空中没有物质，时间还会继续吗？”显然不可能有：
Something, somewhere, at no time or
某事、某处、任何时间或
Something, nowhere, at some time or
某事、某处、某时或
Nothing, somewhere, at some time.
某时某地，什么都没有。
Everything which happens must be structurally represented as something, somewhere, at some time. We want two friends to get together. We invite them to our home for dinner at seven o’clock. The friends are the “something,” the house is the “somewhere,” the seven o’clock is the “some time.” So far as we now know, this is the nature of every situation in the environment in which we live. Yet it was not until Einstein and Minkowski that this concept was rescued from verbiage and nailed to the masthead of modern physics.
发生的一切都必须在结构上表示为某时某地的某事。我们希望两个朋友聚在一起。我们邀请他们七点到我们家吃晚饭。朋友是“某事”，房子是“某处”，七点钟是“某个时间”。据我们现在所知，这是我们生活环境中每种情况的本质。然而直到爱因斯坦和闵可夫斯基，这个概念才从废话中被拯救出来，并被钉在现代物理学的刊头上。
Adam1 says: “I don’t like Harvard University. I wouldn’t send my boy there.” The statement is meaning less as it stands. What is it that you do not like, Mr. Adam? The college buildings, the Yard, the location in Cambridge? The way in which President-Emeritus Lowell handled the Sacco-Vanzetti case in 1927? The theological instruction in 1736? Some members of the faculty in 1938? Parts of the current curriculum? The appointment of James M. Landis as dean of the Law School? The football team? The society crowd? What things? In what place? When?
Adam1 说：“我不喜欢哈佛大学。我不会把我的孩子送到那里。”就目前而言，该声明的意义不大。亚当先生，您不喜欢什么？大学建筑、庭院、剑桥的位置？ 1927 年名誉主席洛厄尔是如何处理萨科-万泽蒂案的？ 1736年的神学指导？ 1938 年的一些教员？当前课程的一部分？任命詹姆斯·M·兰迪斯为法学院院长？足球队？社会人群？什么东西？在什么地方？什么时候？
If Adam1 made a list of those characteristics of Harvard in 1938 which he did like and another of those which he did not like, and found the second more impressive, he might properly say that so far as he knew the circumstances, there were more characteristics of which he disapproved than there were that he approved. Or he might say that a single negative factor outweighed in his mind a large number of positive factors. He could shorten this to “I don’t like Harvard,” provided he were fully conscious of the abstraction, or shore cut, taken. If not conscious of it—and most of us are not in such statements—he is guilty of disliking a phantom. He might say with equal meaning, “I don’t like centaurs.”
如果亚当1列出了1938年哈佛的那些他喜欢的特征和另一个他不喜欢的特征，并且发现第二个更令人印象深刻，他可能会正确地说，就他所知的情况而言，还有更多的特征他不赞成的事情多于他赞成的事情。或者他可能会说，在他看来，单一的负面因素胜过大量的正面因素。他可以将其缩短为“我不喜欢哈佛”，只要他充分意识到所采取的抽象或海岸切割。如果他没有意识到这一点——我们大多数人都没有这样的说法——他就犯了不喜欢幽灵的罪。他可能会以同样的意思说：“我不喜欢半人马。”
“Harvard” is an abstraction of a relatively low order. Applying the what-where-when test to loftier abstractions produces even more shattering results. Take “beauty.” What kind of beautiful thing? At what time? In what place? Take “free speech.” What variety? In what age? In what country? I know of no more effective method for dragging abstractions out of the stratosphere into the market place.
“哈佛”是一个相对低级的抽象。将什么、何地、何时测试应用于更高层次的抽象会产生更令人震惊的结果。以“美”为例。什么样的东西是美丽的？在什么时候？在什么地方？以“言论自由”为例。什么品种？几岁的时候？在哪个国家？据我所知，没有比这更有效的方法可以将抽象概念从平流层拖入市场。
Korzybski employs two allied symbolic devices which I find very helpful. When making a statement about things known, especially scientific things, he appends the date: “The behavior of the human nervous system as known and described by physiologists in 1933.” Scientific concepts grow and change as additional facts are gathered. We can never know it all; rather, we progressively narrow the margin of the unknown. It is useful to acquire the habit of dating statements, scientific or otherwise. Again, when referring to unique individuals, whether they be men, dogs, caterpillars, or pencils, Korzybski uses little mathematical symbols—Smith1, Smith2; Fido1, Fido2—to set them off, one from another. I have already used this device in earlier pages, and will use it frequently again. It helps one to remember that there is no mankind-in-general loose in the universe, but only Adam1, Adam2 . . . Adamn.
科日布斯基使用了两种联合的符号手段，我认为这非常有帮助。在对已知事物，尤其是科学事物进行陈述时，他附加了日期：“生理学家于 1933 年已知和描述的人类神经系统的行为。”随着更多事实的收集，科学概念不断发展和变化。我们永远不可能知道一切；相反，我们逐渐缩小未知的范围。养成对科学或其他方面的陈述进行约会的习惯是很有用的。同样，当提到独特的个体时，无论是人、狗、毛毛虫还是铅笔，科日布斯基都很少使用数学符号——Smith1、Smith2； Fido1、Fido2——将它们彼此分开。我已经在前面的页面中使用过这个设备，并且会再次频繁地使用它。它有助于人们记住，宇宙中不存在松散的人类，只有亚当1、亚当2。 。 。该死。
Besides the indexes and the dates, Korzybski advocates a more general use of quotation marks (the “truth”) in order to remind us that an abstraction is being used and so to put us on guard. He recommends a more general use of hyphens (“psycho-logics”) and a generous sprinkling of “etc., etc.,” to emphasize the point that characteristics have been left out. “The apple is round, sweet, etc.” indicates that the apple has other characteristics in addition to roundness and sweetness. These devices I da not find so useful as the indexes and the dates, but they do help to make us conscious of language.
除了索引和日期之外，科日布斯基还主张更普遍地使用引号（“真相”），以提醒我们正在使用抽象概念，从而让我们保持警惕。他建议更普遍地使用连字符（“心理逻辑”）并大量使用“等等，等等”，以强调特征已被遗漏的这一点。 “苹果又圆又甜，等等。”表明苹果除了圆、甜之外，还有其他的特性。我觉得这些设备不像索引和日期那么有用，但它们确实有助于让我们意识到语言。
Korzybski is severe in his treatment of most philosophy and formal logic. The abstractions and the one- or two-valued judgments of those studies have in his opinion deflected straight thinking for centuries. He gives three symbols to his system of general semantics—A, E, N,—by which he means “non-Aristotelian,” “non-Euclidean,” “non-Newtonian.” These symbols do not aid me much, but they serve to show his point of view. Observe that he is not against Aristotle, or Euclid, or Newton. Great men they were in their day. He is against using their language, logic and concepts today, when better mediums of communication are available—better in the sense that they more truly reflect the world outside.
科日布斯基对待大多数哲学和形式逻辑的态度都是严厉的。在他看来，这些研究的抽象和一值或二值判断已经偏离了几个世纪以来的直接思维。他给他的一般语义学系统赋予了三个符号——A、E、N——他用这三个符号来表示“非亚里士多德式”、“非欧几里得式”、“非牛顿式”。这些符号对我帮助不大，但它们可以表明他的观点。请注意，他并不反对亚里士多德、欧几里得或牛顿。他们在那个时代都是伟人。他反对今天使用他们的语言、逻辑和概念，因为现在有更好的沟通媒介——更好是因为它们更真实地反映了外面的世界。
I have read Science and Sanity completely through three times, and portions of it up to a dozen times. Large sections still are blank in my mind. A book on the clarification of meaning should not be so difficult to understand. Part of the trouble is due to the fact that Korzybski was addressing himself more to scientists and mathematicians than to laymen, part to the fact that he entangled this study with an earlier concept called “time-binding.” It would have been better, I think, if he had forgotten time-binding and started afresh. Whether he will be regarded by posterity as a genius or as a man overstrained by an idea too big to handle I do not know. But I am confident that the material with which he has so exhaustively dealt is of the first importance, and that many of his findings will survive to do him lasting honor. To one who reads and reflects patiently upon his book, the world can never look as it did before. It moves nearer. Many things which were once blurred and misty come into focus.
《科学与理智》我已经完整地读了三遍，部分内容也读了十几遍。我的脑海里仍然有很大一部分是空白的。一本澄清意义的书，应该不会那么难懂。问题的部分原因在于，科尔日布斯基更多地向科学家和数学家而非外行人讲话，部分原因在于他将这项研究与早期称为“时间约束”的概念纠缠在一起。我想，如果他忘记时间限制并重新开始，情况会更好。我不知道他是否会被后人视为天才，还是被视为一个因过于宏大而难以处理的想法而过度紧张的人。但我相信，他如此详尽地处理的材料是最重要的，他的许多发现将留存下来，为他带来持久的荣誉。对于一个耐心阅读并反思他的书的人来说，世界再也不会像以前那样了。它移动得更近了。许多曾经模糊、模糊的事物变得清晰起来。

OGDEN AND RICHARDS
奥格登和理查兹
KORZYBSKI approaches semantics as a mathematician, Ogden and Richards approach it as scholars interested in literature and esthetics. One long section of The Meaning of Meaning is devoted to an analysis of sixteen concepts of “beauty.” It is not without significance that, starting from such different backgrounds, the two studies travel to so many similar conclusions. They agree unequivocally that confusion of word with thing is rampant in the present use of language, and the chief cause of communication failure. They agree that abstract words are grossly mishandled and that this mishandling tends to populate the environment with fabulous entities.
KORZYBSKI 作为数学家来研究语义学，奥格登和理查兹作为对文学和美学感兴趣的学者来研究语义学。 《意义的意义》用一长篇专门分析了十六个“美”的概念。从如此不同的背景出发，这两项研究得出了如此多相似的结论，这并非没有意义。他们明确同意，当前语言使用中词与物的混淆现象十分普遍，也是沟通失败的主要原因。他们一致认为，抽象词的处理方式非常错误，而且这种错误处理往往会导致环境中充斥着神话般的实体。
The heart of the Ogden and Richards analysis can be diagrammed by a triangle as given on [>].
奥格登和理查兹分析的核心可以用 [>] 中给出的三角形来表示。
The triangle is not a pattern of nerve channels, but a diagram showing relations, and so a structural presentation. From the outside world, and sometimes from a pain or other stimulus inside, we receive a sign. “A sign may be any stimulus from without or process within.” This sign we proceed to interpret, to find meaning in. Interpretation, as noted earlier, depends on past experience. The sound of a match scraped upon a box leads us to expect a flame. If we had never known matches, the sign would be without meaning—though a savage might possibly misinterpret it as a devil scratching his ear. The sight of an opened oyster will cause a pleasurable interpretation if we have learned to enjoy oysters, and apathy or disgust if oysters have never been encountered. Human experience is a series of sign situations, followed by reflection and the filing of references in the brain.
三角形不是神经通道的图案，而是显示关系的图表，因此是一种结构表示。从外部世界，有时从内部的疼痛或其他刺激，我们收到一个信号。 “迹象可以是任何来自外部的刺激或内部的过程。”我们继续解释这个符号，以寻找其中的意义。如前所述，解释取决于过去的经验。火柴刮擦盒子的声音让我们期待着火焰。如果我们从来不认识火柴，那么这个标志就毫无意义——尽管野蛮人可能会将其误解为魔鬼在抓耳朵。如果我们学会了享受牡蛎，那么看到打开的牡蛎就会产生愉快的解释，如果我们从未遇到过牡蛎，就会产生冷漠或厌恶。人类的经验是一系列的符号情境，然后是大脑中的反思和参考资料的归档。
The sign calls up the object—the match, the oyster, the pencil—which is labeled the “referent.” The referent is the Thingumbob to which the sign refers. We often say, “‘chien’ means ‘dog’” when we should say that the words “chien” and “dog” both refer to the same animal. In the cortex, the files of memory are consulted and interpretation takes place. This process Ogden and Richards label “reference,” or thought. The “referent” is that to which reference is made. So far, this process applies to all higher animals. Man alone takes the next step. He verbalizes the reference with a word, phrase, or “symbol.” From sign to referent to reference to symbol—that is the order. Animals can limp around the triangle by using a few meaningful cries and gestures in place of words. The words of a parrot skip the top of the triangle altogether.
这个标志唤起了物体——火柴、牡蛎、铅笔——被标记为“所指对象”。所指对象是该符号所指的 Thingumbob。当我们说“chien”和“dog”这两个词指的是同一种动物时，我们经常说“‘chien’就是‘dog’”。在皮层中，内存文件被查阅并进行解释。奥格登和理查兹将这个过程称为“参考”或“思考”。 “所指”是指所指的事物。到目前为止，这个过程适用于所有高等动物。人类独自迈出下一步。他用单词、短语或“符号”来表达所指的内容。从符号到所指对象，再到对符号的指称——这就是顺序。动物可以用一些有意义的叫声和手势代替语言，在三角形周围跛行。鹦鹉的话语完全跳过了三角形的顶部。
Observe that the triangle has no base. This is a matter of the first importance. There is no direct relation between referent and symbol, between thing and word, and there cannot be—except where the symbol is a gesture, such as pointing to the oyster. Even then the reference or thinking mechanism is used. Yet human beings are constantly leaping from word to thing, identifying word with thing. “The most prolific fallacy of human intercourse is that the base of the triangle is filled in.” Try as you may, you cannot eat the word “oyster,” cannot sit on the word “chair,” cannot live on the word “money.” The confusion of the symbol “money” with things in the real world required for survival and comfort is perhaps the central economic difficulty of modern times.
观察三角形没有底边。这是最重要的事情。所指对象和符号之间、事物和词语之间不存在直接关系，也不可能存在这种关系，除非符号是一个手势，例如指向牡蛎。即使这样，也会使用参考或思维机制。然而，人类不断地从词语跳跃到事物，将词语等同于事物。 “人类交往中最常见的谬误是三角形的底边被填满了。”无论你如何努力，你都不能吃“牡蛎”这个词，不能坐在“椅子”这个词上，不能靠“钱”这个词生活。 “金钱”这个符号与现实世界中生存和舒适所需的事物的混淆也许是现代经济的核心困难。
The triangle gives us the key to the allied semantic problem, the misuse of abstractions. Clear communication demands referent, reference, and symbol, all three. Suppose we disregard referent, and simply think about words, using words to externalize that thinking. We cut three factors to two. We then produce great activity on the left side of the triangle—from reference to symbol and back to reference again. The great words roll round and round. The “sublime” merges into the “good” and both into the “eternal.” “Liberty” merges into “individualism” and both into “true democracy.” “National Socialism” merges into “racial purity” and both into “totalitarianism.” Many leaders who mold popular ideas and principles perform with a singular exclusiveness on the left side of the triangle. In the next political discussion that you hear, watch for this lefthanded performance, and take what amusement you can. More often it frightens me. What on earth—literally on earth—are these people talking about? They start far up the abstraction ladder with magnificent disregard for the referent. Yet unless both speaker and hearer are aware of a similar referent, minds cannot meet, agreement cannot be reached, communication is checked as effectively as when one snaps off a radio.
这个三角形为我们提供了解决相关语义问题的关键，即抽象概念的滥用。清晰的沟通需要指称、参考和符号，三者兼而有之。假设我们忽略所指对象，而只是思考词语，并使用词语将这种思维外化。我们将三个因素削减为两个。然后，我们在三角形的左侧产生巨大的活动——从参考到符号，再回到参考。伟大的话语滚滚而来。 “崇高”融入“美好”，两者都融入“永恒”。 “自由”融入“个人主义”，两者又融入“真正的民主”。 “国家社会主义”融入“种族纯洁性”，又融入“极权主义”。许多塑造流行思想和原则的领导者在三角形的左侧表现出独特的排他性。在你听到的下一次政治讨论中，留意这个左撇子的表演，并尽你所能地享受其中的乐趣。更多时候它让我害怕。这些人到底在谈论什么？他们一开始就在抽象阶梯上走得很远，完全无视所指对象。然而，除非说话者和听话者都意识到类似的指涉对象，否则思想就无法相遇，无法达成一致，沟通就会像关掉收音机一样被有效地检查。
Here, for example, is the Archbishop of York saying in connection with the abdication of Edward VIII in the year 1937: “The King is the incarnation of his people.” The statement is gravely discussed, but what does it mean? Here is Mr. Aldrich of the Chase National Bank, admonishing the young at Colgate College while receiving an honorary degree:
例如，约克大主教在谈到 1937 年爱德华八世的退位时说道：“国王是他人民的化身。”该声明引起了认真的讨论，但这意味着什么？以下是大通国家银行的奥尔德里奇先生在获得荣誉学位时对科尔盖特学院的年轻人的告诫：
We need a spiritual regeneration, yes, in business as well as other things. It is essential that we achieve a degree of national unity by developing a concrete philosophy for our young men. Those who understand the spiritual background of our country, and understand what our forefathers were trying to do, are likely to be selected for important positions and become successful.
是的，我们需要精神上的重生，无论是在商业上还是在其他方面。我们必须通过为我们的年轻人制定具体的哲学来实现一定程度的民族团结。那些了解我们国家的精神背景、了解我们的祖先正在努力做的事情的人，很可能会被选拔担任重要职务并取得成功。
Here is Nicholas Berdyaev, a Russian philosopher: “History is the result of a deep interaction between eternity and time; it is the incessant eruption of eternity into time.”
俄罗斯哲学家尼古拉斯·别尔佳耶夫（Nicholas Berdyaev）说：“历史是永恒与时间深刻相互作用的结果；这是永恒向时间的不断爆发。”
If mental energy were inexhaustible, it might nor matter that you and I and college seniors expended good effort trying to understand this sort of thing. But the human mind is capable of a limited amount of concentration, and I doubt if anyone can think hard about abstract subjects for more than two hours a day. Five minutes’ serious thought about the eruption of eternity into time puts me under the table.
如果精神能量是取之不尽用之不竭的，那么你我和大学毕业生花费大量精力试图理解这种事情可能也没什么关系。但人的思维能力是有限的，我怀疑是否有人能每天认真思考抽象主题超过两个小时。五分钟的关于永恒爆发到时间中的严肃思考让我陷入了桌子底下。
To make a statement is to symbolize a reference, to give a label to a thought. But a reference without a referent hangs in mid-air. No cat would be guilty of such nonsense. “The advance in knowledge is the increase in our power of referring to referents as they actually hang together.” The structural idea again.
发表声明就是象征性参考，为思想贴上标签。但是没有参照物的参照物却悬在半空中。没有一只猫会犯这样的废话。 “知识的进步是我们指代所指事物的能力的增强，因为它们实际上是在一起的。”再次是结构思想。
Is a coin circular or elliptical? An observer at table level sees it as elliptical. An observer above the coin sees it as circular. What a problem for philosophers! The coin could keep a school of Heavy Thinkers busy for decades on the left side of the triangle, discussing the quality of the elliptical and the essence of the circular. By no manner of make-believe can we discuss the what of referents: What is a table? We can only discover the how. How does a table look? What are its characteristics? How do our senses experience it?
硬币是圆形的还是椭圆形的？桌子层面的观察者将其视为椭圆形。硬币上方的观察者将其视为圆形。对于哲学家来说这是多么大的问题啊！这枚硬币可以让一群思想家在三角形的左侧忙碌数十年，讨论椭圆形的质量和圆形的本质。我们绝不能以任何方式虚构地讨论所指对象的含义：什么是表格？我们只能探索如何做。桌子看起来怎么样？其特点是什么？我们的感官如何体验它？
The point of every discussion is to find the referent. When it is found, emotional factors dissolve in mutual understanding. The participants are then starting from a similar foundation, talking about similar things. The disagreement, if it must arise, is grounded on a firm base. It is easier, of course, to find the referent for “oxygen” than to find referents, one or more, for “liberty” or “feudalism.” If referents for a high-order abstraction are impossible to find, further discussion is futile. If referents are difficult to locate, that is a bother. But they must be found.
每次讨论的重点都是找到指涉对象。当找到它时，情感因素就会溶解在相互理解中。然后，参与者从相似的基础出发，谈论相似的事情。如果一定要出现分歧，那么它是有坚实基础的。当然，找到“氧气”的指称比找到“自由”或“封建主义”的一个或多个指称更容易。如果无法找到高阶抽象的指称，则进一步的讨论是徒劳的。如果很难找到参照物，那就很麻烦了。但必须找到它们。
We cannot escape from concrete referents by using abstract language. If we try to dodge the difficulty, our words become meaningless. We frequently use the abstraction “mankind.” What is the referent? Depending somewhat on the context, or the way we use “mankind,” the referent is every person who ever lived, or every living person, or a sample study of enough persons to warrant limited conclusions about all persons. On the basis of persons living today, the referents are Adam1, Adsm2, Adam3, up to about Adam2,000,000,000. What can you say about such a vast collection of Adams? You can say that practically every one of them has two legs and ten fingers and a complicated cortex. You can say they all must eat, and maintain their bodies within certain limiting temperatures. You can probably say that every Adam abuses language, provided he talks at all. Characteristics, descriptive statements, inferences, which are a matter of common record about all Adams can be mentioned without doing violence to the term “mankind.” But you cannot say with real meaning, “Mankind is instinctively co-operative”; “Mankind is by nature warlike”; “Mankind is subject to the law of tooth and claw”; “Mankind is a spark of the Divine.” You cannot make such statements because many Adams, as physically observed, flatly contradict the dictum, or because no competent observations are on record. Yet how often in using the term have you completely overlooked the parade of Adams, a file of men, women, and children two billion strong which, if marching one foot apart, would stretch fifteen times around the equator? This is your referent. Too often I have forgotten it, and used “mankind” as a lever to promote a private concept of what I wanted men to do or be. There is no entity “mankind.” Call as briskly as you may, “Hey, Mankind, come here!” and not an Adam will answer.
我们无法通过抽象语言来逃避具体的指称。如果我们试图逃避困难，我们的话就变得毫无意义。我们经常使用“人类”这个抽象概念。参照物是什么？在某种程度上取决于上下文或我们使用“人类”的方式，所指对象是曾经生活过的每个人，或每个活着的人，或对足够多的人进行的样本研究，以保证对所有人的有限结论。以今天生活的人为基础，所指对象是Adam1、Adsm2、Adam3，直到大约Adam2,000,000,000。对于如此庞大的亚当斯收藏，您有什么想说的？你可以说，几乎每个动物都有两条腿、十个手指和一个复杂的皮质。你可以说它们都必须进食，并将身体维持在一定的极限温度内。你可能会说，每个亚当都滥用语言，只要他会说话。特征、描述性陈述、推论，这些都是关于所有亚当的共同记录，可以在不侵犯“人类”一词的情况下提及。但你不能真正意义上说“人类本能地合作”； “人类生性好战”； “人类受制于牙齿和利爪的法则”； “人类是神的火花。”你不能做出这样的陈述，因为根据物理观察，许多亚当斯与该格言截然相反，或者因为没有记录在案的有效观察结果。然而，在使用这个词时，你有多少次完全忽视了亚当斯的游行，这是一个由二十亿男人、女人和儿童组成的队伍，如果分开一英尺，将绕赤道延伸十五圈？这是你的参考对象。我经常忘记这一点，并使用“人类”作为杠杆来推广我希望男人做什么或成为什么的私人概念。不存在“人类”实体。尽可能轻快地喊道：“嘿，人类，来这里！”没有一个亚当会回答。
For such terms as “the omnipotent” and “the eternal,” let us note again, there are no referents of any sort. Meaningful communication is impossible, however much the user of the term may draw peace or comfort from it. Practically all that one can say about “the sublime” is that it is “that essence which partakes of sublimity”—blab1 partakes of blab2—which is not especially rewarding. Or one can say “the sublime” means “the omnipotent.” Another blab. “Sublime” is a useful adjective to establish rough relations—a sublime view, a sublime wine; to be used sparingly for what one considers top-notch. The word derives from the Latin, connoting originally “up to the lintel.”
让我们再次注意，对于诸如“全能”和“永恒”之类的术语，不存在任何类型的指称。无论该术语的使用者如何从中获得平静或安慰，有意义的沟通都是不可能的。实际上，关于“崇高”，人们所能说的就是它是“分享崇高的本质”——blab1 分享 blab2——这并不是特别有价值。或者可以说“崇高”意味着“无所不能”。又是一句废话。 “崇高”是一个有用的形容词，可以用来建立粗略的关系——崇高的景色，崇高的葡萄酒；谨慎地用于人们认为一流的东西。这个词源自拉丁语，最初的意思是“直到门楣”。
Terms like “capitalism” are not so bodiless. They lie between “mankind” with its observable parade of Adams, and “the sublime” with nothing observable. Referents for “capitalism” are hard but perhaps not impossible to locate. We shall try to find some in a later chapter. It is quite safe to say that few people today have similar referents for “capitalism,” and therefore most of the discussion about it is meaningless.
像“资本主义”这样的术语并不是那么无形。它们介于“人类”和“崇高”之间，“人类”可以观察到亚当斯的游行，而“崇高”则没有任何可观察到的东西。 “资本主义”的指称很难找到，但也许并非不可能。我们将在后面的章节中尝试找到一些内容。可以肯定地说，今天很少有人对“资本主义”有类似的指称，因此大多数关于它的讨论都是毫无意义的。
Experiences of individuals differ. Hence their images for high-order abstractions differ. It is accordingly wise in a discussion, say Ogden and Richards, to start with things to which one can point, simple referents with simple symbols, such as Adam1, that car there, that bank, this baseball game. Then ascend the abstraction ladder gingerly, pausing for frequent checks. It will save time and friction in the end.
个人的经历不同。因此，他们的高阶抽象图像有所不同。因此，奥格登和理查兹说，在讨论中明智的做法是从人们可以指出的事物开始，即带有简单符号的简单指示物，例如亚当1、那里的那辆车、那家银行、这场棒球比赛。然后小心翼翼地登上抽象阶梯，停下来进行频繁的检查。最终会节省时间和摩擦。
The Meaning of Meaning sets forth certain canons for good language. Among them are the following:
《意义的意义》规定了良好语言的某些准则。其中包括以下内容：
One symbol stands for one and only one referent. The word “Rover” in any discussion stands for one particular dog. The referent may be complex, however, like “all Mongolian imbeciles,” “all income-tax payers in Connecticut.” Mathematical symbols have no specific referent, but can be manipulated through laws agreed upon to apply to any given set. We shall enlarge upon this important idea at a later point.
一个符号代表一个且仅一个所指对象。在任何讨论中，“Rover”这个词都代表一只特定的狗。然而，所指对象可能很复杂，比如“所有蒙古傻瓜”、“康涅狄格州所有所得税纳税人”。数学符号没有特定的指示物，但可以通过商定的适用于任何给定集合的定律进行操作。我们稍后将详细阐述这个重要的想法。
Symbols which can be substituted one for another symbolize the same reference, or thought. I am thinking about the same object whether I say “Hobie Baker” or “my yellow cat.”
可以相互替代的符号象征着相同的参考或思想。无论我说“霍比·贝克”还是“我的黄猫”，我都在思考同一个物体。
The referent of a contracted symbol is the referent of that symbol expanded, as in the case of “mankind,” which we have already discussed. A contracted symbol is a short-cut tag, or an abstraction of a higher order.
收缩符号的所指对象是扩展符号的所指对象，就像我们已经讨论过的“人类”的情况一样。收缩符号是一个快捷标签，或者是更高阶的抽象。
A symbol refers to what it is actually used to refer to. It refers to what is in the speaker’s head, not to what good usage demands, or to what the hearer thinks it refers to. If I say “my yellow dog” by a slip of the tongue when I mean my cat, Hobie Baker is the referent, even if you quite naturally think I am talking about a dog. Needless to say, slips of the tongue may effectively block communication. If an English shopgirl says, “The postman is bringing the book,” it is probably a magazine to which she refers, not a “book” as commonly known in other circles.
符号指的是它实际用来指代的东西。它指的是说话者头脑中的内容，而不是良好用法所要求的内容，也不是听者认为它所指的内容。如果我口误说“我的黄狗”，而我指的是我的猫，霍比·贝克就是所指，即使你很自然地认为我在谈论一只狗。不用说，口误可能会有效地阻碍沟通。如果一位英国女店员说：“邮差正在带来这本书”，她指的可能是一本杂志，而不是其他圈子中通常所说的“书”。
“Only such a set of canons,” observe our authors, “will enable the philosopher to discuss more important matters than his own or his colleagues’ peculiarities of expression.”
我们的作者指出，“只有这样一套准则，才能使哲学家讨论比他自己或他同事的表达特性更重要的问题。”
When we define a word, we reach for the dictionary and substitute another symbol for the same referent. A “sofa” is also called a “lounge.” When we define a thing, we describe its characteristics: “This sofa to which I refer is five feet long, three feet broad, made of oak, covered with soft pillows colored green.” The sofa as an object apprehended by the senses is below the verbal level, and the process of description is very different from defining a word by giving a synonym for it.
当我们定义一个单词时，我们会查阅字典并用另一个符号替换相同的指示物。 “沙发”也称为“休息室”。当我们定义一个事物时，我们会描述它的特征：“我指的这张沙发长五英尺，宽三英尺，由橡木制成，上面覆盖着绿色的柔软枕头。”沙发作为感官所理解的物体，处于语言层面以下，描述的过程与通过给出同义词来定义一个词有很大不同。
The Meaning of Meaning was first published in England in 1923. There have been several revised editions, the latest in 1936. C. K. Ogden has devoted many years in the interim to the formulation of Basic English, an international language now displacing such synthetic languages as Esperanto. Eight hundred and fifty English words and five simple rules do the work of 20,000 words. By combining ten fundamental operations of physics with twenty directions of geometry, Ogden got rid of 4,000 English verbs. A bright student can learn Basic in a few weeks, and for that quarter of mankind (half a billion Adams) which already speaks English, only a little polishing is necessary. If Basic becomes general, not only will communication be aided, but one of the reasons for wars will be lessened. It is harder to hate “foreigners” who speak one’s language.
《意义的意义》于 1923 年在英国首次出版。曾有过多次修订版，最近一次修订版是 1936 年。在此期间，CK Ogden 投入多年时间来制定基础英语，这是一种国际语言，现已取代世界语等合成语言。八百五十个英语单词和五个简单的规则就可以完成 20,000 个单词的工作。通过将物理学的十个基本运算与几何学的二十个方向相结合，奥格登摆脱了 4,000 个英语动词。一个聪明的学生可以在几周内学会基础语言，而对于已经会说英语的四分之一的人类（五亿亚当斯）来说，只需要一点点润色就可以了。如果基础变得普遍，不仅会有助于沟通，而且会减少战争的原因之一。讨厌说自己语言的“外国人”更难。
Meanwhile I. A. Richards has been extending the concepts first announced in The Meaning of Meaning in a series of books of his own. One interesting study deals with twelve anonymous poems sent to hundreds of students taking courses in literature in English and American colleges, inviting their detailed interpretations. One could not ask for a more somber example of communication failure. These students, presumably at the forefront of our cultural heritage, differed fantastically in their ideas of what the poems meant—as a whole, or phrase by phrase—and in their evaluations of them. The same poem was extravagantly praised and bitterly condemned. What confused the young people above all was that authors’ names were omitted. How could they be expected to judge verse unless they knew who wrote it? . . . Which puts us in mind of Shaw’s outraged critics in Fanny’s First Play.
与此同时，IA Richards 在他自己的一系列书籍中扩展了《意义的意义》中首次提出的概念。一项有趣的研究涉及十二首匿名诗歌，这些诗歌被发送给数百名在英国和美国大学修读文学课程的学生，邀请他们进行详细的解释。没有比这更悲惨的沟通失败的例子了。这些学生大概处于我们文化遗产的最前沿，他们对诗歌的整体意义或逐句意义的理解以及对诗歌的评价截然不同。同一首诗受到过分的赞扬和严厉的谴责。最让年轻人困惑的是作者的名字被省略了。除非他们知道诗的作者是谁，否则怎么能指望他们去评判诗呢？ 。 。 。这让我们想起了肖在《范妮第一部戏剧》中愤怒的批评者。
In The Philosophy of Rhetoric (an unfortunate title in my opinion), Richards amplifies with great clarity certain aspects of semantics. The studies of rhetoric and grammar assume that words have definite, one-valued meanings. But most words as they pass from context to context change their meanings, and in many different ways. It is their duty and their service to us to do so. We recall Malinowski’s phrase “context of situation,” and his inability to understand the words of a primitive people until he had shared their life. A major cause of communication failure is the one-proper-meaning superstition, to wit, that a word has meaning of its own independent of its use, and controlling its use. As a matter of fact, a word has similar meaning only in a similar context. Here are four statements employing the word “fat”:
在《修辞哲学》（我认为这是一个不幸的标题）中，理查兹非常清晰地阐述了语义学的某些方面。修辞和语法的研究假设单词具有明确的、单值的含义。但大多数单词在从一个上下文传递到另一个上下文时都会以多种不同的方式改变它们的含义。这样做是他们的责任，也是他们为我们提供的服务。我们回想起马林诺夫斯基的短语“情境背景”，以及他在分享原始人的生活之前无法理解他们的语言。沟通失败的一个主要原因是单一意义迷信，即认为一个词有其自身的意义，独立于它的使用，并控制它的使用。事实上，一个词只有在相似的上下文中才具有相似的含义。以下是使用“胖”一词的四种说法：
She is a fat girl.
她是一个胖女孩。
You have a fat chance of winning that race.
你赢得那场比赛的机会很大。
The fat is in the fire.
要出麻烦了。
Below the skin of all mammals is a layer of fat.
所有哺乳动物的皮肤下面都有一层脂肪。
Comment is unnecessary as to the elastic nature of “fat,” or of many words. “What a word means is the missing parts of the contexts from which it draws its delegated efficacy.” Take the statement: “The — swooped out of the sky and taxied to the hangar.” Here the context is incomplete, but it indicates the word “airplane” so clearly that we hardly need to use the label. The image comes without the word.
对于“脂肪”或许多单词的弹性性质没有必要评论。 “一个词的含义是它所代表的功效所在的上下文中缺失的部分。”就拿这句话来说吧：“从天而降，滑行到机库。”这里的上下文不完整，但它清楚地表明了“飞机”这个词，我们几乎不需要使用这个标签。图像没有文字。
The one-proper-meaning superstition is made worse by written words, because on the page they appear with white spaces between them, setting them off as separate and unique. Spoken words run more together, and a statement or a sentence is evaluated as a whole and the context more readily grasped. The avalanche of printed words grows heavier year by year and the offsetting blast of words from radio loud-speakers has its own disadvantages. “The view that meanings belong to words in their own right is a branch of sorcery, a relic of the magical theory of names.”
书面文字使单一正确含义的迷信变得更糟，因为在页面上，它们之间出现空白，使它们显得独立且独特。口语中的单词更加连贯，一个陈述或一个句子被作为一个整体来评估，并且更容易掌握上下文。大量的印刷文字逐年增多，而无线电扬声器发出的大量文字也有其自身的缺点。 “认为意义本身就属于词语的观点是巫术的一个分支，是魔法名称理论的遗迹。”
We point to the dictionary as the conclusive arbiter of meaning. More magic. The dictionary is almost the last place in which to find it. Look to the context, the order and the relation in which the word is being actively employed. No word in isolation can be judged correct or incorrect, beautiful or ugly, or anything else that matters, any more than a single musical note can be judged except in relation to a melody, a composition, or at least a chord. Without context the word may be written “blab.” By long association we come to like the sound of certain words, but try them on a Chinese gentleman. “Through caverns measureless to man” is a fine, ringing line of poetry. Now take the same five words and jumble the order: “measureless man caverns to through.” Ugly and irritating.
我们认为字典是意义的最终仲裁者。更多魔力。字典几乎是最后一个能找到它的地方。查看该词被积极使用的上下文、顺序和关系。任何一个词都不能孤立地被判断为正确或不正确、美丽或丑陋，或者任何其他重要的事情，就像除了与旋律、作曲或至少和弦有关之外，不能判断单个音符一样。如果没有上下文，这个词可能会写成“blab”。经过长期的联想，我们开始喜欢某些词的发音，但可以在一位中国绅士身上尝试一下。 “穿过人类无法估量的洞穴”是一首优美而响亮的诗句。现在用同样的五个词并打乱顺序：“无量的人洞穴通向。”又丑又烦人。
Publishers and theatrical producers are frequently guilty of performing word magic by tearing a phrase from a reviewer’s context and using it in a blurb. The reviewer, for example, says, “This book is a beautiful example of how to confuse the reader.” Next morning the Star-Tribune appears with an advertisement on the book page with a streamhead: “Beautiful example. . . . Q. K. Hokus.” Yet in this case I doubt if the publisher would legally be held guilty of fraudulent practice. He has misrepresented in fact, but so confident are judges and the rest of us that words have meaning in themselves that simply proving Mr. Hokus did say “beautiful example”—which he did—would probably constitute adequate defense.
出版商和戏剧制片人经常犯下这样的错误：从评论者的上下文中撕下一个短语并在简介中使用它，从而施展文字魔法。例如，评论家说：“这本书是如何迷惑读者的一个很好的例子。”第二天早上，《明星论坛报》的书页上出现了一则广告，标题是：“美丽的例子。 。 。 。 QK 霍库斯。”但在这种情况下，我怀疑出版商是否会在法律上被判犯有欺诈行为。他事实上歪曲了事实，但法官和我们其他人都如此自信，以至于言语本身就有意义，仅仅证明霍库斯先生确实说过“美丽的例子”——他确实说过——可能就构成了充分的辩护。
Abstract terms are especially subject to change in meaning as context changes. At a later point we shall note how the meaning of “commerce” has altered since 1787, when the famous Commerce Clause was written into the Constitution. Yet we seek for a fabulous consistency, and we regard a shift in meaning as a flaw, a regrettable accident, rather than as a virtue. The remedy is not to resist such changes, but to follow them gladly, proud of the flexibility of speech. Widely adopted, says Richards, this remedy would be like the introduction of Arabic numerals where Roman had prevailed. (Try to divide MLXXIV by CXVI in those symbols.) It might inaugurate a new era of human understanding and cooperation. The one-proper-meaning superstition stands glumly in the road. Words are not one-valued; they arc often multivalued, and can take as many values as there are contexts.
随着上下文的变化，抽象术语的含义尤其容易发生变化。稍后我们将注意到自 1787 年著名的商业条款写入宪法以来，“商业”的含义发生了怎样的变化。然而，我们寻求一种令人难以置信的一致性，并且我们将意义的转变视为一种缺陷，一种令人遗憾的意外，而不是一种美德。补救办法不是抵制这些变化，而是高兴地跟随它们，并为言论的灵活性感到自豪。理查兹说，这种补救措施被广泛采用，就像罗马数字盛行时引入阿拉伯数字一样。 （尝试在这些符号中将 MLXXIV 除以 CXVI。）它可能会开启人类理解与合作的新时代。这种真正意义上的迷信闷闷不乐地矗立在路上。言语不是单值的；它们通常是多值的，并且可以采用与上下文一样多的值。
ARNOLD AND ROBINSON
阿诺德和罗宾逊
Thurman W. Arnold in his book The Symbols of Government makes an important and entertaining application of semantic theory. His “symbols” apply not to specific words, but to the principles, ideals, dogmas, mostly verbal, which men carry around in their heads. In order to avoid confusion with the more rigorous “symbols” of Ogden and Richards, I shall use “principles” in discussing Arnold. A job lot of American principles today includes:
瑟曼·W·阿诺德 (Thurman W. Arnold) 在他的《政府的象征》一书中对语义理论进行了重要且有趣的应用。他的“符号”并不适用于具体的词语，而是适用于人们头脑中牢记的原则、理想、教条，大部分是口头的。为了避免与奥格登和理查兹更严格的“符号”混淆，我将使用“原则”来讨论阿诺德。当今美国的许多原则包括：
Democracy is the best form of government.
民主是最好的政府形式。
Governments are by nature corrupt and inefficient.
政府本质上是腐败且低效的。
A worthy man can always get a job.
一个有价值的人总是能找到工作的。
Pecuniary thrift is a sterling virtue.
节约金钱是一种纯正的美德。
Laziness is a vice.
懒惰是一种恶习。
The Constitution is a divinely inspired document.
宪法是一份神圣默示的文件。
Private property is a sacred right.
私有财产是一项神圣的权利。
You can’t change human nature.
你无法改变人性。
Principles provide standard rules for judgment and for conduct. Instead of investigating the facts of a situation, one claps a principle upon it. If the principle happens to fît the facts, it may be a useful timesaver. If it is based on facts of a bygone age, its application to new facts and new conditions may be ridiculous or disastrous. Principles often make sense at the time of their origination—although the Aryan myths which the Nazis are now formulating into principles make no sense at alL The trouble is that after adoption, people begin to regard them as eternal, good for any situation, anywhere, at any time.
原则为判断和行为提供了标准规则。人们不是去调查一种情况的事实，而是在其上强加一项原则。如果这个原理恰好符合事实，那么它可能会节省时间。如果它是基于过去时代的事实，那么它应用于新事实和新条件可能是荒谬的或灾难性的。原则在其诞生之时往往是有意义的——尽管纳粹现在将雅利安神话制定为原则根本没有任何意义。问题是，在采用之后，人们开始认为它们是永恒的，适用于任何情况、任何地方，随时。
Taking the job lot listed above, we note that the dogma about the inefficiency of governments probably originated with the English economists around 1820, and ceased to have much relation to the facts after the very efficient British Civil Service was inaugurated in the 1870’s. The principles about the worthy man and his job, the beauties of thrift, and the vices of laziness squared with the facts so long as America was a nation of pioneers. The principles began to be inapplicable in the Eastern section of the country after 1850 and in the West after 1900, when the frontier closed. The divinity of the Constitution was unheard of when the Constitution was drafted and for many years thereafter. The widespread canonization of the document has come in the last few generations. The human-nature principle was laid down before recent work in biology, psychology, and anthropology made it irrelevant. And so it goes.
考虑到上面列出的工作，我们注意到，关于政府效率低下的教条可能起源于1820年左右的英国经济学家，在1870年代非常高效的英国公务员制度建立后，就不再与事实有太大关系了。只要美国是一个开拓者的国家，关于有价值的人和他的工作的原则、节俭的美和懒惰的恶习就符合事实。 1850 年之后，这些原则开始不适用于该国东部地区，1900 年边境关闭后，这些原则开始不适用于西部地区。宪法的神圣性在宪法起草时以及此后的许多年里都是闻所未闻的。在过去的几代人中，该文件得到了广泛的经典化。人性原则是在生物学、心理学和人类学的最新研究使其变得无关紧要之前制定的。事情就是这样。
Principles change from time to time, but normally lag far behind changes in the facts of the outside world. Men are doing things they do not believe in some decades ahead of believing in them. Many of us are now using oaths and swear words but think it wrong to do so. A generation hence, blasphemy will probably be merely a bore, with no moral principle involved. Today government provides work and money for the unemployed. This contravenes the principle of government interference and is regarded in high quarters as a lamentable necessity. A few years hence it will almost certainly be accepted as sound theory.
原则有时会发生变化，但通常远远落后于外界事实的变化。人们早在几十年前就开始做一些他们不相信的事情。我们中的许多人现在都在使用誓言和脏话，但认为这样做是错误的。一代人之后，亵渎可能只是一种无聊的事情，不涉及任何道德原则。今天，政府为失业者提供工作和金钱。这违反了政府干预的原则，并被高层认为是一种可悲的必要性。几年后，它几乎肯定会被接受为合理的理论。
In semantic terms, a principle is a judgment involving high-order abstractions, normally without referents, difficult to test by experiment or operation, revered for itself as such. Some principles appear to make life more tolerable; a greater number have the opposite effect. By intoning principles, and particularly by saying that the application of this great ideal hurts me more than it does you, one can perform many unkind acts with a clear conscience. When we believe in the Malthusian explanation of the slums (the “law” of population growth makes them inevitable), slums cease to trouble us. When we believe that the highest good is a balanced budget, the misery of those cut from relief rolls is a secondary matter. When we are convinced that any worthy man can get a job, unemployment can be disregarded and measures to alleviate it can be opposed.
用语义术语来说，原则是涉及高阶抽象的判断，通常没有指称，难以通过实验或操作来测试，本身就受到尊重。有些原则似乎可以让生活变得更容易忍受；数量较多会产生相反的效果。通过吟诵原则，特别是通过说实施这一伟大理想对我的伤害比对你的伤害更大，一个人可以问心无愧地做出许多不友善的行为。当我们相信马尔萨斯对贫民窟的解释时（人口增长的“规律”使贫民窟不可避免），贫民窟就不再困扰我们。当我们相信平衡预算是最大的好处时，那些被削减救济金的人的痛苦就成了次要问题。当我们确信任何有价值的人都能找到工作时，我们就可以忽视失业问题，并反对缓解失业问题的措施。
A hypocritical person can use principles as smoke screens to further personal ends, but a sincere person often follows them blindly for their own sake, regardless of individual gabs or losses. Thus some employers who are opposed to labor unions on principle are prepared to lose millions of dollars rather than sully their ideals. What they personally lose, society, they hope, will some day gain.
虚伪的人可以利用原则作为烟幕弹来达到个人目的，但真诚的人常常为了自己的利益而盲目地遵循原则，而不顾个人的闲言碎语或损失。因此，一些原则上反对工会的雇主宁愿损失数百万美元也不愿玷污他们的理想。他们希望社会有一天会得到他们个人所失去的东西。
Principles are often tangled up in practical application. A man named Paul LoGiudici was sentenced for murder in the State of New York. Shortly before the sentence was to be carried out, he developed a psychosis. This made it clear that, being insane, he could not be executed. He was morally incapable of distinguishing right from wrong, and so could not derive a salutary lesson from the execution. He was sent to a hospital and given kind and careful treatment for his malady. Thousands of dollars were spent on him over a period of ten years. Finally by a miracle of psychiatric skill he was cured. Obviously he now knew right from wrong, and must be executed. If he were turned loose, there would be no respect for the law. The death chamber was prepared. Governor Lehman, deficient in logic but long on human understanding, commuted the sentence to life imprisonment.
原则在实际应用中常常是混乱的。一名名叫保罗·洛朱迪奇 (Paul LoGiudici) 的男子因谋杀罪在纽约州被判刑。在执行判决前不久，他出现了精神病。这清楚地表明，由于他疯了，所以不能被处决。他在道德上没有辨别是非的能力，因此无法从死刑中得到有益的教训。他被送往医院，并因病情得到了友善和细心的治疗。十年间，他在他身上花费了数千美元。最后，凭借精神病学的奇迹，他被治愈了。显然他现在已经知道是非了，必须被处决。如果他被释放，法律就不会受到尊重。死亡室已经准备好。雷曼州长缺乏逻辑性，但长于人类的理解能力，将判决减为无期徒刑。
Arnold believes that the history of principles “is a succession of romantically unnecessary sacrifices of human life or comfort in their honor.” The blood-sacrifice ideas of the Aztecs come to mind, and the heresy hunts of the Inquisition. Principles are not tools by which discoveries are made, for they tend to close the mind against free inquiry. When men observe the world in the light of ideals which they consider sacred and timeless, they tend to develop priests rather than scientists. Egyptian priests were skilled embalmers, but they learned little practical physiology, for their operations were rigorously governed by ceremonial and precedent.
阿诺德认为，原则的历史“是一系列在浪漫上不必要的人类生命牺牲或为了纪念他们的安慰”。我的脑海中浮现出阿兹特克人的血祭思想，以及宗教裁判所的异端追捕。原则不是发现的工具，因为它们往往会封闭思想，阻碍自由探究。当人们根据他们认为神圣和永恒的理想来观察世界时，他们往往会培养牧师而不是科学家。埃及祭司是熟练的防腐师，但他们很少学到实用的生理学，因为他们的操作受到仪式和先例的严格控制。
A major reason why the social studies are so backward compared to the physical sciences, Arnold observes, is that the former are largely concerned with principles, the latter with experiments. The principles of Washington’s Farewell Address are still considered sources of social wisdom; the methods of Washington’s physician, however, are no longer studied. The social “sciences” look to the past, the physical sciences to the present. Economists, lawyers, students of government, examine the lessons to be learned from history, unmindful that the procession of events we call “history” is an irreversible process. That an event never exactly repeats itself is a cardinal concept of scientists.
阿诺德认为，社会研究与物理科学相比如此落后的一个主要原因是，前者主要关注原理，后者主要关注实验。华盛顿告别演说的原则仍然被认为是社会智慧的源泉。然而，人们不再研究华盛顿医生的方法。社会“科学”着眼于过去，物理科学着眼于现在。经济学家、律师、政府专业的学生研究从历史中汲取的教训，却没有注意到我们称之为“历史”的事件的进程是一个不可逆转的过程。事件永远不会完全重演，这是科学家的一个基本概念。
Rational thinking uncontaminated by experiment compels the professors to seek rounded systems of doctrine and a smooth and consistent flow of absolutes. A court of law which achieves a desirable result in human terms by an inexact use of legal concepts arouses more criticism from legal scholars than a court which achieves a calamitous result in a learned way. The struggle to formulate principles which are sound, systematic, and consistent often leads to the building of utopias by reformers and to the defense of abuses by conservatives. An engineer, on the other hand, is “able to give an adequate explanation of what is wrong with a bridge which falls without blaming the girders that collapsed because they did not have the moral stamina to stand the strain.”
不受实验污染的理性思维迫使教授们寻求全面的学说体系和平稳一致的绝对真理。一个通过不准确地运用法律概念而取得人性化的理想结果的法院，比一个以博学的方式取得灾难性结果的法院更招致法律学者的批评。制定健全的、系统的和一致的原则的斗争常常导致改革者建立乌托邦，并导致保守派为滥用权力辩护。另一方面，工程师“能够对倒塌的桥梁的问题给出充分的解释，而不会责怪倒塌的大梁，因为它们没有承受压力的道德耐力。”
Most people are kind and humane in ordinary situations. But when a given reform becomes entangled with their principles, many of them turn cruel. Arnold observes sardonically that from a strictly humanitarian point of view the best government is found in a modern hospital for the insane. Here principles are at a minimum. The aim of the doctors is to make the patients as comfortable as possible, consistent with the physical facilities at their disposal and the current science of medicine, regardless of the patients’ moral deserts. At this point we locate the principle which Arnold would substitute for many now in vogue: “The ideal that it is a good thing to make people comfortable if the means exist by which it can be done.”
大多数人在平常的情况下都是善良和人道的。但当某项改革与他们的原则纠缠在一起时，他们中的许多人就会变得残酷。阿诺德讽刺地指出，从严格的人道主义角度来看，最好的政府是在一家现代化的精神病医院里。这里的原则是最低限度的。医生的目标是让病人尽可能舒适，符合他们所拥有的物理设施和当前的医学科学，而不考虑病人的道德沙漠。在这一点上，我们找到了阿诺德将取代许多现在流行的原则：“理想的是，如果存在可以实现这一点的手段，那么让人们感到舒适是一件好事。”
The late Professor E. S. Robinson of Yale follows along a similar path. He notes in his Psychology and the Law four kinds of explanations which people give to justify their beliefs:
已故的耶鲁大学教授 ES Robinson 也走着类似的道路。他在《心理学与法律》中指出人们为了证明自己的信仰而给出的四种解释：
The impulsive: Much used by primitive man on the idea that any explanation was better than none.
冲动：被原始人广泛使用，认为任何解释都比没有好。
The authoritarian: It is so because the good book, the King or the medicine man says it is so.
独裁者：之所以如此，是因为好书、国王或药师都这么说。
The rationalistic: It is so because I have reasoned it out in my head (on the left side of the triangle). The facts must fit this reasoning. If they do not, they are unimportant.
理性主义者：之所以如此，是因为我已经在头脑中推理出来了（在三角形的左侧）。事实必须符合这个推理。如果不这样做，它们就不重要。
The scientific: “Here the standard of validity is found in a world of stubborn and irresistible fact which originates outside the thinking process, but which offers a constant discipline and obligation to the honest intellectual life.”
科学的：“在这里，有效性的标准是在一个充满顽固和不可抗拒的事实的世界中找到的，它起源于思维过程之外，但它为诚实的智力生活提供了持续的纪律和义务。”
In dealing with the physical world the test of fact is generally accepted as supreme. In dealing with the world of social control it is widely believed that there are other tests more to be respected—authority, internal consistency, rationalistic thinking, historic principles. To see the world as it is, says Robinson, rather than suffused with the rosy light of principles, is not an effort to get along without ideals, aims, and aspirations; “it is an effort to make these purposes real, to make them attainable in concrete terms.” High ideals can result in the Thirty Years’ War between Catholic and Protestant, or they can result in the vital activities of the Red Cross. On the one side death, on the other life. With more looking outward and less looking inward, we might shift our behavior toward the Red Cross side.
在处理物理世界时，事实检验通常被认为是至高无上的。在处理社会控制领域时，人们普遍认为还有其他更值得尊重的标准——权威、内部一致性、理性思维、历史原则。罗宾逊说，要看到世界的本来面目，而不是充满原则的玫瑰色光芒，并不是要在没有理想、目标和抱负的情况下努力相处；而是要在没有理想、目标和愿望的情况下努力相处。 “这是使这些目标成为现实、使它们具体实现的努力。”崇高的理想可能导致天主教和新教之间的三十年战争，也可能导致红十字会的重要活动。一方面是死亡，另一方面是生命。如果更多地向外看，更少地向内看，我们的行为可能会转向红十字会一边。
Both Robinson and Arnold advance a strong case for mental fictions. They hold that without principles to guide them most men would feel as naked as they would walking down the street without their clothes. Perhaps a collection of fictions is inevitable. But I confess I look forward to the day when we shall dispense with concepts not derived from careful observation and from the necessities of survival and well-being under the conditions of this earth. Nothing else can we know surely, and nothing else should be bowed down to. Or so it seems to me.
罗宾逊和阿诺德都为心理虚构提出了强有力的论据。他们认为，如果没有原则指导，大多数男人会感觉就像赤裸裸地走在街上一样。也许小说集是不可避免的。但我承认，我期待着有一天，我们将抛弃那些并非源自仔细观察以及源自地球条件下生存和福祉必需品的概念。没有什么是我们可以肯定知道的，也没有什么是我们应该屈服的。或者说在我看来是这样。
If Americans were devoid of rigid principles, it is conceivable that poverty would have been virtually liquidated about 1925, when mass production became a dominating element in the manufacture of goods; that the great depression would not have taken place; that the so-called Supreme Court crisis would not have arisen; that the labor situation would not have become acute; that the prospects of a war involving this country would be fantastically remote; that the Democratic and Republican parties would be extinct; and that we could go peaceably about our business of improving our relations to the environment about us.
如果美国人没有严格的原则，可以想象，到 1925 年左右，当大规模生产成为商品制造的主导因素时，贫困实际上已经被消除了。大萧条不会发生；所谓的最高法院危机就不会出现；劳工状况不会变得严峻；涉及这个国家的战争的可能性极其渺茫；民主党和共和党将会消亡；我们可以和平地开展改善我们与周围环境的关系的工作。
This may be a little fantasy of my own. But I do soberly ask, Why, if we must have principles, do many of them have to be so cruel in their tangible effects, and so badly timed for what is happening in the real world now? I think one important answer is found in the structure of the language we use.
这可能是我自己的一点幻想。但我确实要清醒地问，如果我们必须有原则，为什么其中许多原则的实际效果必须如此残酷，而且对于现实世界现在正在发生的事情来说又如此不合时宜？我认为一个重要的答案可以在我们使用的语言的结构中找到。

MEANING FOR SCIENTISTS
对科学家的意义
WHY is the work of Einstein constantly injected into this discussion? Is not semantics difficult enough to grasp without dragging in a scientist whom only a handful of men are said to understand? I sympathize with the harassed reader. For my own sake as well as for his, I wish that in this particular study we could give modern physics a wide berth. But we cannot. We must face the music. I am not, however, going to take you far into technical depths, because, among other reasons, I do not know enough.
为什么爱因斯坦的工作不断被注入到这个讨论中？如果不把据说只有少数人能理解的科学家拉进来，语义难道还不够难以掌握吗？我对受到骚扰的读者表示同情。为了我自己和他的利益，我希望在这项特殊的研究中我们能够对现代物理学敬而远之。但我们不能。我们必须面对现实。然而，我不会带您深入了解技术深度，因为除其他原因外，我还不够了解。
Einstein not only turned the physicists upside down; he also revolutionized certain aspects of human communication. A shock went around the world comparable to that produced by Darwin’s theory of evolution. In the long run, relativity may prove a more important factor in language than in physics. Its impact has caused thoughtful men everywhere to look to their words, to question the validity of their concepts. In the domain of physics, chemistry, biology, relativity has been responsible for an unprecedented crop of young geniuses, due to the sudden expansion of understanding which its concepts promote. To see the outside world primarily in terms of relations rather than in terms of absolute substances and properties seems to develop an intellectual keenness hitherto unknown.
爱因斯坦不仅颠覆了物理学家，而且还颠覆了物理学家。他还彻底改变了人类交流的某些方面。震惊世界的程度堪比达尔文进化论所产生的震撼。从长远来看，相对论在语言中可能比在物理学中更重要。它的影响使得世界各地有思想的人们开始审视他们的言论，质疑他们的概念的有效性。在物理、化学、生物学领域，相对论因其概念所促进的理解的突然扩展而造就了前所未有的年轻天才。主要从关系的角度而不是从绝对的实体和属性的角度来看待外部世界，似乎会发展出一种前所未有的智力敏锐度。
Rest on this thought for a moment. Since 1905, when relativity was first announced, and especially since the 1920’s when the quantum concept began to bulk large in physics, a gathering number of human beings have been thinking and communicating in ways more sure, more powerful, than have any human beings before. The new weapon is so sharp that it sometimes wounds them; there is much to be done in reconciling certain aspects of relativity and quantum theories; but they have set out upon an adventure whose excitement and importance it is difficult to overestimate.
暂时搁置这个想法。自从 1905 年相对论首次被提出以来，特别是自 1920 年代量子概念开始在物理学中广泛传播以来，越来越多的人开始以比以前任何人都更确定、更强大的方式思考和交流。 。新武器太锋利了，有时会伤到他们。在协调相对论和量子理论的某些方面还有很多工作要做；但他们已经开始了一次冒险，其刺激性和重要性是难以估量的。
Einstein separated the observer from the observed. He threw the ego out of physics. He derived a picture of the world relatively undeflected by the human senses. As a result he produced the closest fit yet made to happenings in nature. To communicate what he had done, Einstein employed a mathematical language, the calculus of tensors, which, says E. T. Bell, “threshes out the laws of nature, separating the observer’s eccentricities from what is independent of him, with the superb efficiency of a modern harvester.”
爱因斯坦将观察者与被观察者分开。他把自我从物理学中剔除出去。他得出了一幅相对不受人类感官影响的世界图景。结果，他创造了迄今为止最接近自然界发生的事情的作品。为了传达他所做的事情，爱因斯坦使用了一种数学语言，即张量微积分，ET Bell 说，这种语言“以现代数学方法的卓越效率，推导出自然法则，将观察者的怪癖与独立于他的事物分开”。收割机。”
To measure anything accurately a man must take a scaled rule, a clock, a telescope, or other instruments, and make readings. Every reading depends on the finite velocity of light from meter stick to eye, and on the finite velocity of nerve currents from eye to cortex. Although the finite velocity of light was indicated more than two centuries ago (1676), up to the time of Einstein it was assumed that readings were instantaneous. Newton did not take into consideration the finite velocity of the ray of light from instrument to eye. Einstein did, and Newtonian physics had to be revised. Measurements were found to be distorted, especially measurements over long distances. Newton’s rules of mechanics still work in terrestrial magnitudes with close approximation, but his absolutes have lost their majesty. It was found that “infinite velocity” was but a polite way of speaking about blunders in observation.
为了准确地测量任何东西，人们必须使用带刻度的尺子、时钟、望远镜或其他仪器并进行读数。每个读数都取决于从仪表棒到眼睛的有限光速，以及从眼睛到皮层的神经电流的有限速度。尽管有限光速早在两个多世纪前（1676 年）就已被指出，但直到爱因斯坦时代，人们都认为读数是瞬时的。牛顿没有考虑到光线从仪器到眼睛的有限速度。爱因斯坦这样做了，牛顿物理学也必须修改。测量结果被发现存在失真，尤其是长距离测量。牛顿的力学规则在地球星等上仍然有效，并且非常接近，但他的绝对法则已经失去了威严。人们发现，“无限速度”只是一种礼貌的说法，用来描述观察中的错误。
Einstein thus gave a new cast to meaning. He found the meaning of “length” no longer in absolute space, but in the operations by which the length of physical objects was determined; he checked the meaning of “simultaneity” by operations, and found the concept untenable. It followed that “absolute space” and “absolute time” were metaphysical notions in our heads. When operations were called for, the notions disappeared—to the acute dismay of the majority of physicists.
爱因斯坦因此赋予了意义新的含义。他发现“长度”的意义不再存在于绝对空间中，而是存在于决定物理物体长度的运算中；他通过操作检查了“同时性”的含义，发现这个概念站不住脚。由此可见，“绝对空间”和“绝对时间”是我们头脑中的形而上学概念。当需要进行手术时，这些概念就消失了——这让大多数物理学家感到非常沮丧。
This brings us to another matter of the first importance. If Einstein challenged the massed knowledge of the past, including the immortal Newton, and gave contemporary physicists severe mental indigestion, why did they tolerate such brashness? Why did they not arise as one man and say in effect, “To thunder with you, Mr. Einstein!”? If I challenged the whole structure of money and credit, however persuasively, the economists and statesmen would say, “To thunder with you, Chase!” and turn on their heels. That would probably be the end of it.
这给我们带来了另一个最重要的问题。如果爱因斯坦挑战了包括不朽的牛顿在内的过去的大量知识，并给当代物理学家带来了严重的精神消化不良，那么他们为什么要容忍如此鲁莽呢？为什么他们不作为一个人站起来并实际上说：“与你一起打雷，爱因斯坦先生！”？如果我挑战货币和信贷的整个结构，无论多么有说服力，经济学家和政治家都会说：“蔡斯，和你一起打雷！”并转身离开。事情大概就这样结束了。
Einstein could not be dismissed because he was working within the rigor of the scientific method. I could be dismissed because scientific method is unknown in the domain of money and credit; there is no standard by which sane men can agree that I am wrong or right. Honest scientists applied standards of proof to Einstein’s findings, and much as it pained their inner feelings, they had to agree that he was right. If and when Homo sapiens perishes from this planet, I hope that some creature, somewhere, will remember that once men climbed to this high place. A few members of the race acknowledged a discipline which made them bow, because they knew that it was true, to something that in their hearts they hated.
爱因斯坦不能被解雇，因为他是在严格的科学方法范围内工作的。我可能会被解雇，因为科学方法在货币和信用领域是未知的；没有任何标准可以让理智的人同意我是错还是对。诚实的科学家对爱因斯坦的发现应用了证明标准，尽管这让他们内心感到痛苦，但他们不得不承认他是对的。如果当智人从这个星球上灭绝时，我希望某个地方的某些生物会记得曾经人类爬到过这个高处。种族中的一些成员承认一种让他们屈服的纪律，因为他们知道这是真的，对他们内心讨厌的东西。
Science does not consist of gentlemen with Vandyke beards in white coats squinting down microscopes, as per the toothpaste advertisements headed “Science Says.” Science is actually a high-order abstraction, and cannot say anything. A given scientist may speak from time to time, judiciously or injudiciously as the case may be. The scientific method, or what a scientist does, may be described in some such terms as these, to follow E. T. Bell:
科学并不像牙膏广告中标题为“科学说”的那样，是由穿着白大褂、眯着眼睛在显微镜下留着范戴克胡子的绅士组成的。科学实际上是一种高阶抽象，不能说什么。一位特定的科学家可能会不时地发表明智或不明智的言论，视具体情况而定。科学方法，或者科学家所做的事情，可以用以下一些术语来描述，遵循 ET Bell：
The central position is held by experiment. The experiment must be conducted under rigidly standard conditions, so that another trained man can repeat it. If A claims that he has raised a four months’ corpse from the dead, he must describe his procedure so that B can revivify another corpse, or prove to the world, on A’s own say-so, that A was mistaken, to use no harsher term.
实验占据了中心地位。该实验必须在严格的标准条件下进行，以便另一位受过训练的人可以重复它。如果A声称他已经从死里复活了四个月的尸体，他必须描述他的程序，以便B可以复活另一具尸体，或者根据A自己的说法向世界证明A是错误的，没有使用更严厉的术语。
Next comes a tying-up of experiments into bundles having one or more characteristics in common, a period of classification.
接下来是将实验捆绑成具有一个或多个共同特征的捆绑，即分类阶段。
From the group of experiments, deductions or conclusions are then drawn. Many scientists stop here. (But some of them begin to believe in the ghostly existence of classes as “entities,” and thus fall out of science into philosophy.)
然后从这组实验中得出推论或结论。许多科学家就此止步。 （但他们中的一些人开始相信阶级作为“实体”的幽灵般的存在，从而从科学陷入哲学。）
Laws or generalizations may then be attempted, such as Newton’s law of gravity. The laws of nature are not Mosaic tablets, but practical rules for human action with nature. Obey them or get into trouble.
然后可以尝试定律或概括，例如牛顿万有引力定律。自然法则不是马赛克石碑，而是人类与自然相处的实际规则。服从他们，否则就会遇到麻烦。
Another standard procedure among scientists is to construct from the facts available a hypothesis, or hunch. State it frankly as a hypothesis; or better, keep it to yourself. Then arrange a series of experiments by which the hypothesis can be proved or disproved. As in the case of the revivified corpse, other investigators must be able to repeat the experiments and check the proof. This was essentially Einstein’s procedure. He got an idea; he expressed it in mathematical language, arrived at the shattering hypothesis of relativity, and called for experimental proof.
科学家的另一个标准程序是根据现有事实构建假设或预感。坦率地陈述它作为一个假设；或者更好的是，保留给你自己。然后安排一系列实验来证明或反驳假设。与复活尸体的情况一样，其他调查人员必须能够重复实验并检查证据。这本质上是爱因斯坦的程序。他想到了一个主意；他用数学语言表达了这一点，得出了令人震惊的相对论假设，并呼吁进行实验证明。
It is interesting to follow the course of that proof. Among other predictions which arose from the hypothesis, three were held to be of primary importance: (1) that the motion of the perihelion of Mercury must be approximately 42.9 seconds a century; (2) that a ray of light coming from a distant star must be bent as it passed the sun at an angle of approximately 1.745 seconds; (3) that the displacement of certain lines in the solar spectrum ought to be approximately .008 Angstrom units. Many experiments have been made, and as the measurements have grown more precise, the results have approached more closely to the predictions. The motion of the perihelion of Mercury has been verified with high precision; measurements of the angle of bending light-rays near the sun are now down to 1.72 seconds, with a probable error of .11 seconds plus or minus; the displacement of lines in the spectrum is down to .009 units, where the prediction called for .008.
遵循这个证明的过程是很有趣的。在该假设产生的其他预测中，有三个被认为是最重要的：（1）水星近日点的运动必须大约为每世纪 42.9 秒； (2) 来自遥远恒星的光线在经过太阳时必须以大约 1.745 秒的角度弯曲； (3) 太阳光谱中某些谱线的位移应约为 0.008 埃单位。已经进行了许多实验，随着测量变得越来越精确，结果也越来越接近预测。水星近日点的运动已被高精度验证；太阳附近光线弯曲角度的测量现在已降至 1.72 秒，可能误差为 0.11 秒正负；谱线中的线位移降至 0.009 个单位，而预测要求为 0.008 个单位。
The hypothesis was thus proved correct within the limits of current knowledge, which is enough to expect. But relativity was not made into “eternal truth.” Good scientists were through with “eternals.” Relativity was simply the truest picture of certain aspects of the world yet discovered. In 1938 it still remains so. In 1988 it may be superseded by a concept which shows a closer fit. Darwin, Pasteur, and Chamberlin also began with preliminary hypotheses which were later verified in whole or in part. Unverified remainders go down the drainpipe with the dishwater.
因此，在现有知识的范围内，该假设被证明是正确的，这足以令人期待。但相对论并没有成为“永恒的真理”。优秀的科学家已经摆脱了“永恒”的束缚。相对论只是迄今为止所发现的世界某些方面最真实的图景。 1938年依然如此。 1988 年，它可能会被一个更合适的概念所取代。达尔文、巴斯德和张伯伦也从初步假设开始，这些假设后来被全部或部分验证。未经证实的残留物与洗碗水一起流入排水管。
Here is a scientist investigating a contagious fever. He wants to find out how the disease is transferred from one victim to the next. First he browses around in the literature of contagious diseases. In due time he gets an idea that it might be conveyed by some bloodsucking creature. By prolonged and painstaking research in the field and in the laboratory, in which many bloodsucking creatures are examined and discarded, he finally verifies the hypothesis. The mosquito is found guilty. Any competent man can repeat the experiment and prove it. A conquest has been made far greater than that of Cortes.
这是一位科学家正在研究传染性发烧。他想弄清楚这种疾病是如何从一个受害者传染给下一个受害者的。他首先浏览了有关传染病的文献。在适当的时候，他意识到这可能是由某种吸血生物传达的。通过在现场和实验室进行长期艰苦的研究，对许多吸血生物进行检查和丢弃，他最终验证了这一假设。蚊子被判有罪。任何有能力的人都可以重复这个实验并证明这一点。征服的规模远大于科尔特斯。
Look at another picture for the sake of contrast. A devoted socialist asks if the misery caused by poverty can be cured. Long experience with poor people and rich people leads him to the hypothesis that capitalism is at fault. He cannot verify it by any conclusive experiment which another man can check, so he argues and affirms that capitalism is the mosquito. It may be so, but his only support is a series of scattered observations, logic in his head, and goodwill in his heart. Scientific knowledge moves steadily forward; social reform plunges, rears, falls back to plunge again. The scientist finds his referents and makes positive that others can find them in the dark. The reformer can seldom locate his referents, even if there are any to be found. I have tried to be a reformer and I ought to know.
为了对比，看另一张图片。一位虔诚的社会主义者询问是否可以治愈贫困造成的痛苦。与穷人和富人打交道的长期经验使他得出这样的假设：资本主义有问题。他无法通过任何其他人可以检查的结论性实验来验证这一点，因此他论证并肯定资本主义是蚊子。也许是这样，但他唯一的支撑就是一系列零散的观察、头脑中的逻辑和心中的善意。科学知识稳步前进；社会改革急转直下，后退，再回落。科学家找到了他的参照物，并确信其他人可以在黑暗中找到它们。即使可以找到任何参照物，改革者也很少能找到他的参照物。我曾尝试成为一名改革者，我应该知道这一点。
The scientific method is concerned with how things do happen, not how they ought to happen. Knowledge of the way things do happen, with no ifs, ands, or buts, allows us to deal more effectively with our environment. The method is no more an exclusive matter for professionals than it is a matter of white coats and goggles. Most of us are amateur scientists today, though we are veldom aware of it. You are driving along a strange road and become lost. In what direction are you going? The sun is shining. You look at shadows cast by telephone poles and then look at your watch. It is near noon, so the shadows must run approximately north and south. The operation is crude, but it saves gasoline. I am waging war on tent caterpillars in my orchard. I douse a nest with kerosene. Then one of similar size beside it I paint lightly with kerosene. Next day I look to see if the second method is as effective as the first in killing caterpillars. If it is, I use it on other nests and so save time and kerosene. This is a crude controlled experiment. The scientific method is not primarily a matter of laboratories and atom-smashers or even meter sticks; it is a way of looking at things, a way of gathering from the world outside knowledge which will stay put, and not go wandering off like the wickets in Alice’s croquet game.
科学方法关注的是事情如何发生，而不是事情应该如何发生。了解事情发生的方式，没有如果、和或但是，使我们能够更有效地应对我们的环境。该方法不再是专业人士的专属问题，就像白大褂和护目镜的问题一样。今天，我们大多数人都是业余科学家，尽管我们对此知之甚少。您沿着一条陌生的道路行驶并迷路了。你要去哪个方向？太阳普照。你看着电线杆投下的影子，然后看看手表。现在已经接近中午了，所以影子一定是大致向北和向南延伸。操作虽然简陋，但可以节省汽油。我正在对果园里的帐篷毛毛虫发动战争。我用煤油浇在鸟巢上。然后我在旁边的一个类似大小的地方用煤油轻轻涂漆。第二天，我看看第二种方法在杀死毛毛虫方面是否与第一种方法一样有效。如果是的话，我会在其他巢上使用它，这样可以节省时间和煤油。这是一个粗略的对照实验。科学方法主要不是实验室和原子粉碎机甚至米尺的问题；而是科学方法的核心。这是一种看待事物的方式，一种从外部世界收集知识的方式，这些知识会留在原处，而不是像爱丽丝槌球游戏中的三柱门那样四处游荡。
Greek philosophers argued bitterly about what water was. People today no longer become angry and take sides as to the composition of water. Agreement has been reached and the mind rests. We no longer burn witches as responsible for the outbreak of plague. We burn up the cables for antitoxins and the Red Cross.
希腊哲学家对于水是什么进行了激烈的争论。今天的人们不再对水的成分感到愤怒和偏袒。协议已达成，心已安息。我们不再将烧死女巫视为鼠疫爆发的罪魁祸首。我们烧毁抗毒素和红十字会的电缆。
Every spring the Nile came down and washed out the field boundaries of the ancient Egyptians. It was a damned nuisance. Whose field was where? This question marked the beginning of surveying and geometry. First, the Egyptians had to agree that the problem was worth attacking. Second, they had to see the possibility of a solution on which sane men could agree. Third, the solution had to be such that other sane men, then and in the future, proceeding by the rules laid down, could reach similar conclusions from the given facts. A’s field was here, B’s was there, and no more quarrels and uncertainties. According to Bell, these steps of agreeing to agree, and producing a set of rules on which sane men could agree and obtain similar results, “were the most important ever taken by our race.”
每年春天，尼罗河都会冲垮古埃及人的田野边界。这实在是太麻烦了。哪里是谁的田地？这个问题标志着测量学和几何学的开始。首先，埃及人必须同意这个问题值得解决。其次，他们必须看到是否有可能找到一个理智的人能够达成一致的解决方案。第三，解决方案必须使得其他理智的人在当时和将来按照既定规则行事，能够从给定的事实中得出类似的结论。 A的场在这里，B的场在那里，不再有争吵和不确定性。贝尔认为，这些同意一致的步骤，以及制定一套规则，让理智的人能够达成一致并获得类似的结果，“是我们种族有史以来采取的最重要的一步”。
By the scientific method, men are brought to agreement; in it emotion and passion have no place. The degree of emotion displayed by a disputant, observes Bertrand Russell, is a direct indication of his lack of knowledge of the subject at issue. At the stage of unproved hypothesis, scientists can let themselves go to squabble and scratch, but when the experimental proof comes in, they must cease their bickering and remove their hats.
通过科学方法，人们能够达成一致；其中没有情感和激情。伯特兰·罗素认为，争论者所表现出的情绪程度直接表明他对所争论的主题缺乏了解。在假设未经证实的阶段，科学家们可以放任自己去争吵、抓挠，但当实验证明到来时，他们就必须停止争吵并摘下帽子。
The fact has always been for the physicist the one ultimate thing from which there is no appeal, and in the face of which the only possible attitude is a humility almost religious.
对于物理学家来说，事实始终是最根本的事情，对此没有任何吸引力，面对它唯一可能的态度是近乎宗教的谦卑。
ON THE NATURE OF CONCEPTS
论概念的本质
Let us look more closely into the new meanings suggested by Einstein’s work. A synonym for the word “meaning” is the word “concept.” Scientists prefer the latter term. The lines quoted above about the authority of the fact were written by P. W. Bridgman of Harvard. In this section we will follow the development of concepts as set forth in his Logic of Modern Physics. Wherever scientists are struggling with new forms of meaning this book is known and respected. It is perhaps the dearest statement yet produced of how a scientist today orders, or should strive to order, his intellectual equipment.
让我们更仔细地研究爱因斯坦的工作所暗示的新含义。 “意义”一词的同义词是“概念”一词。科学家更喜欢后一个术语。上面引用的有关事实权威的文字是由哈佛大学的 PW Bridgman 撰写的。在本节中，我们将跟踪他的《现代物理学逻辑》中提出的概念的发展。无论科学家在何处努力探索新的意义形式，这本书都会广为人知并受到尊重。这也许是迄今为止关于科学家如何订购或应该努力订购他的智力设备的最亲切的陈述。
“Our understanding of nature is non-existent apart from our mental processes, so that strictly speaking no aspect of psychology or epistemology is without pertinence.” Thus semantics takes a front seat at the beginning of the performance. Broadly speaking, modern science is concerned with two techniques of parallel importance: (1) instruments for conducting experiments and (2) language with which to explain the experiments. Both techniques have been refined and are constantly improved.
“离开我们的心理过程，我们对自然的理解是不存在的，因此严格来说，心理学或认识论的任何方面都不是没有相关性的。”因此，语义在表演开始时就占据了首位。从广义上讲，现代科学涉及两种同等重要的技术：（1）进行实验的仪器和（2）解释实验的语言。这两种技术都得到了完善并不断改进。
How do we get facts into our heads and form concepts? Einstein shattered a whole cosmology of concepts. Let us not be knocked galley-west again, says Bridgman. The attitude of the physicist must be one of pure empiricism, recognizing no a priori principles or absolutes which determine or limit new experience. Experience is determined only by experience. This means that we must give up the demand that the world outside be embraced in any one formula, either simple or complicated. It may turn out that nature can be so embraced, but thinking must be organized not to demand it as a necessity. Concepts must be so ordered that present experience does not exact hostages of the future. After Newton’s great work, the door to certain new concepts was firmly shut, and when Einstein broke out the side of the house, the faculty nearly froze to death. Keep the door open and get used to fresh air.
我们如何将事实带入头脑并形成概念？爱因斯坦粉碎了整个宇宙学的概念。布里奇曼说，让我们不要再次被击向西边的厨房。物理学家的态度必须是一种纯粹的经验主义，不承认任何决定或限制新经验的先验原则或绝对。经验只能由经验决定。这意味着我们必须放弃用任何一种公式（无论简单还是复杂）来包容外部世界的要求。也许事实证明，自然可以如此被拥抱，但思维必须被组织起来，而不是把它当作一种必然。概念必须如此有序，以确保当前的经验不会成为未来的人质。在牛顿的伟大工作之后，某些新概念的大门被牢牢地关闭了，当爱因斯坦冲破房子的一侧时，教员们几乎冻死了。保持门打开，习惯新鲜空气。
Before Einstein, concepts in physics were usually defined in terms of “properties.” In Book I of Newton’s Principia we read: “Absolute, True and Mathematical Time, of itself, and from its own nature, flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called Duration.” Time is something in and of itself. But, says Bridgman, if we examine the definition of “absolute time” in the light of experience, we find nothing in nature with such properties. Even a layman can check this statement. Try to think of “time” as an entity and you will be almost as baffled as in the case of “the eternal.” You can think of the face of a clock, of what occurred yesterday, or of watching Jesse Owens break the world’s record for the 220-yard dash. You can think of specific “times,” but of no universal.
在爱因斯坦之前，物理学中的概念通常是用“性质”来定义的。在《牛顿原理》第一卷中，我们读到：“绝对的、真实的和数学的时间，就其本身而言，从其本身的性质来看，不考虑任何外部因素而均匀地流动，它的另一个名字叫做持续时间。”时间本身就是某种东西。但是，布里奇曼说，如果我们根据经验来审视“绝对时间”的定义，我们会发现自然界中没有任何东西具有这样的属性。即使是外行也可以检查这个声明。尝试将“时间”视为一个实体，你几乎会像对待“永恒”一样感到困惑。您可以想象钟面、昨天发生的事情，或者观看杰西·欧文斯 (Jesse Owens) 打破 220 码短跑世界纪录。你可以想到特定的“时代”，但没有普遍的“时代”。
Scientists observe “local times” on the earth, or “extended times” in the stellar depths. A light-year is a measurement standard in extended time, but it connotes space traversed in a year’s time. We must not talk about the age of a beam of light, says Bridgman, though the concept of age is one of the simplest derivations of local time here on earth. We must not allow ourselves to think of events taking place in Arcturus now with the connotations attached to events taking place here now. “It is difficult to inhibit this habit of thought, but we must learn to do it.”
科学家观察地球上的“当地时间”，或恒星深处的“延长时间”。光年是延长时间的测量标准，但它意味着一年的时间所走过的空间。布里奇曼说，我们不能谈论光束的年龄，尽管年龄的概念是地球上当地时间最简单的推导之一。我们决不能让自己将现在在大角星上发生的事件与现在在这里发生的事件联系起来。 “抑制这种思维习惯很困难，但我们必须学会去做。”
P. Lecomte du Noüy has recently observed:
P. Lecomte du Noüy 最近观察到：
At different ages it takes different lengths of time to accomplish the same amount of work, and, as everyone realizes, the physiological significance of a day is not identical for insects and for animals that live to be sixty years old. . . . Everything occurs as if sidereal time flowed four times faster for a man of fifty than for a child of ten.
在不同的年龄，完成相同的工作量需要不同的时间长度，而且，众所周知，对于昆虫和活到六十岁的动物来说，一天的生理意义并不相同。 。 。 。一切的发生就好像五十岁的男人的恒星时间比十岁的孩子快四倍。
Do you remember the endless days of childhood? Our biological processes shift with age, and an hour is a different thing to a child and to an adult.
你还记得童年那无尽的日子吗？我们的生物过程随着年龄的增长而变化，对于儿童和成人来说，一小时是不同的事情。
Bridgman develops various concepts for “length” in post-Einsteinian terms—where an absolute property “length” has been dropped overboard. We can talk for years about what “length” means and not arrive anywhere. To find meaning we must heave out of our armchairs, secure some meter sticks or other instruments, and with our hands perform certain operations. Follow carefully now, for we are coming to the “operational approach” so cardinal to semantic understanding. “The concept of length is fixed when the operations by which length is measured are fixed.” The concept involves as much as a set of operations and no more. Applying this to “absolute time,” we find no way to measure it. No operation can be performed in respect to it. Into operations involving time, other factors enter, preventing isolation. We cannot say that “absolute time” either does or does not exist, only that no operations yet found can measure it, and so the concept, as of 1938, is meaningless.
布里奇曼用后爱因斯坦的术语发展了各种关于“长度”的概念——绝对属性“长度”已经被抛弃了。我们可以谈论“长度”的含义很多年，但没有任何结果。为了找到意义，我们必须从扶手椅上站起来，固定一些米尺或其他仪器，并用手执行某些操作。现在请仔细遵循，因为我们即将讨论对语义理解至关重要的“操作方法”。 “当测量长度的操作固定时，长度的概念就固定了。”这个概念只涉及一组操作，仅此而已。将其应用于“绝对时间”，我们找不到测量它的方法。无法对其执行任何操作。在涉及时间的操作中，其他因素也会介入，从而防止孤立。我们不能说“绝对时间”存在或不存在，只是目前还没有发现可以测量它的操作，因此这个概念在1938年是没有意义的。
Concepts not subject to operations are meaningless. Speculations about an expanding universe, the curve of entropy (that is, that the universe is running down like a wound watch), are meaningless, because no experiment can yet measure the phenomena. Such speculations fall under the head of “extrapolation,” which means taking a few points on a curve and riding the line which joins them to Cloudcuckooland. It is exhilarating mental exercise and quite all right if you know that it is Cloudcuckooland. If you become serious about it, you may wake up some morning to find yourself a public laughingstock.
不服从操作的概念是没有意义的。关于宇宙膨胀、熵曲线（即宇宙像上弦手表一样向下运行）的猜测是毫无意义的，因为还没有实验可以测量这些现象。此类推测属于“外推法”，即在曲线上取几个点，然后沿着将它们连接到 Cloudcuckooland 的线行驶。这是令人兴奋的脑力锻炼，如果你知道那是云杜鹃乐园，那就没什么问题了。如果你认真对待这件事，你可能有一天早上醒来会发现自己成为公众的笑柄。
We take our meter stick and measure a house lot. This is a simple operation and gives us one concept for “length.” Next we stand out in front of the house lot and measure a trolley car moving down the street. The car, unlike the house lot, is not at rest and the operations have to change. We have to allow for velocity. When the trolley car stops, measuring operations are similar to those for the house lots, but when it begins to move, length becomes a function of velocity and so “time” gets into the concept.
我们拿起米尺测量了一个房屋的面积。这是一个简单的操作，为我们提供了一个“长度”的概念。接下来，我们站在房屋前，测量一辆沿着街道行驶的无轨电车。与房屋不同，汽车不是静止的，操作必须改变。我们必须考虑到速度。当无轨电车停止时，测量操作与房屋地块的测量操作类似，但当它开始移动时，长度变成速度的函数，因此“时间”就进入了概念。
We now want to measure the distance between the sun and the planet Jupiter. To do so we have to throw away our meter sticks and take to telescopes. Length is no longer tactual, but optical. New operations are demanded and therefore new concepts. “To say that a star is 105 light-years distant is actually and conceptually a different kind of thing than to say that a telegraph pole is 100 feet away.”
我们现在想要测量太阳和木星之间的距离。为此，我们必须扔掉米尺并使用望远镜。长度不再是触觉上的，而是视觉上的。需要新的操作，因此需要新的概念。 “说恒星距离 105 光年实际上和概念上与说电线杆距离 100 英尺是不同的。”
Turning and going down the scale from stars to molecules, we find that other instruments and operations are needed, and so the concept of length must shift again. Presently the measuring gauges are found to be atomic in structure, without clear boundaries. At very short lengths, the concept merges into the field equations of electricity. (“Long” and “short” are terms showing relations, usually relative to a man.)
从恒星到分子，我们发现需要其他仪器和操作，因此长度的概念必须再次转变。目前发现测量仪在结构上是原子的，没有明确的边界。在很短的长度内，这个概念融入到电的场方程中。 （“长”和“短”是表示关系的术语，通常是相对于一个人而言。）
Thus “length” is not something which an object possesses, as a man possesses a shirt; it is a word in our heads. Its meaning is determined by what we do, rather than by what we say, and the concept shifts with our doing. To use the same label “length” for these various concepts, says Bridgman, may be convenient, but is always dangerous, and perhaps costs too much in terms of ambiguity. Some Great Thinker is likely to turn it into stone at any moment, declaring that length is length, now and forever, and let there be no more nonsense about it.
因此，“长度”并不是物体所拥有的东西，就像人拥有一件衬衫一样；它是物体所拥有的东西。这是我们脑海中的一句话。它的含义是由我们所做的而不是由我们所说的决定的，并且这个概念随着我们的行为而变化。布里奇曼说，对这些不同的概念使用相同的标签“长度”可能很方便，但总是危险的，而且可能会因为模糊性而付出太大的代价。某些伟大的思想家可能随时将其变成石头，宣称长度就是长度，从现在到永远，不要再胡言乱语了。
The operational approach makes knowledge about the world outside no longer absolute, but relative. The operation is performed relative to some standard, say the gauge or the meter stick. Concepts emerge from these operations which are definite and verifiable. Another man can perform the operation and check the concept. Concepts, observes Bridgman, must be constructible out of the materials of human experience and workable within that experience. When concepts move beyond the reach of experience, they become unverifiable hypotheses. Knowledge advances when we find how things are related and in what order. This ties in with Korzybski’s central idea of knowledge as structural.
操作方法使关于外部世界的知识不再是绝对的，而是相对的。该操作是相对于某种标准（例如仪表或米尺）进行的。从这些操作中产生的概念是明确且可验证的。另一个人可以执行操作并检查概念。布里奇曼认为，概念必须能够根据人类经验的材料构建出来，并且在该经验中可行。当概念超出经验范围时，它们就变成了无法验证的假设。当我们发现事物如何相关以及以什么顺序相关时，知识就会进步。这与科尔日布斯基关于知识是结构性的中心思想相联系。
In Chapter 1 we noted that the operational approach renders meaningless such Great Questions as: May space be bounded? It clears the air of scores of questions which have bemused or tortured thinkers for thousands of years. Try it yourself. Pose a Great Question, say “Is man a free agent or is his course fatalistically determined?” Look for an operation which can answer it. Keep on looking. Look under the bed, out in the garage, everywhere except into your own mind. In the end you will find that no operation is possible, and the question, to date, is meaningless. You can argue about it if it amuses you, but neither you nor your opponent can know anything about it. At least not yet.
在第一章中，我们注意到，操作方法使得诸如以下这些重大问题变得毫无意义：空间是否有界？它澄清了数千年来困扰或折磨思想家的数十个问题。自己尝试一下。提出一个伟大的问题，说“人是自由人还是他的道路是宿命决定的？”寻找一个可以回答这个问题的操作。继续寻找。看看床底下、车库里，到处看看，除了你自己的头脑。最后你会发现无法进行任何操作，而且这个问题迄今为止毫无意义。如果你觉得有趣，你可以争论它，但你和你的对手都对此一无所知。至少现在还没有。
A hundred years ago the question “Is man a product of evolution?” was in a similar fix. Along came Darwin and Wallace, and by a series of operations, experiments, and deductions fixed the concept of evolution, gave the question meaning, and conclusively answered it in the affirmative. Observe that clocks and meter sticks were not much used by Darwin, but careful observations and descriptions, of a qualitative rather than a quantitative character.
一百年前，“人是进化的产物吗？”这个问题。也有类似的修复。达尔文和华莱士出现了，通过一系列的运算、实验和推论，确定了进化论的概念，赋予了问题意义，并最终给出了肯定的回答。请注意，达尔文并没有大量使用时钟和米尺，而是进行了仔细的观察和描述，其特征是定性而不是定量。
Length to a physicist is no longer a property to be applied to any object, anywhere, at any time; it is a series of concepts—length1, house lots; length2, moving trolley cars; length3, solar distances; length4, atoms—as many concepts as there are different operations. It may be objected that this is all very confusing. On the contrary, it was the old one-valued concept of length which furnished the confusion. When Einstein broke it open, knowledge jumped forward. The new concepts worked.
对于物理学家来说，长度不再是随时随地应用于任何物体的属性；它是一系列概念——长度1、房屋面积；长度2、移动无轨电车； length3，太阳距离； length4，原子——有多少种不同的操作就有多少个概念。也许有人会反对，认为这非常令人困惑。相反，正是旧的单值长度概念造成了混乱。当爱因斯坦打开它时，知识向前飞跃。新概念奏效了。
What a floodlight this throws on the notion of consistency. Consistent with what? Where? When? To use the house-lot concept of length in stellar distances, just to be consistent, brings useful knowledge to a standstill. To use “local-time” concepts in the field of “extended time,” just to be consistent, makes one an anti-Einsteinian today, and something of an ignoramus. Similarly, to lay down the concept of free speech as practiced in America on Asiatic peoples, who have never experienced the American variety of vocal liberty, is consistent if you like, but meaningless. Consistency is a jewel if you keep it in similar contexts. If you go leaping into other times and other places, it turns to paste and colored glass. No statesman can be “consistent” if conditions change while he is in office. Ignorant of the semantic idea involved, he spends sleepless nights worrying about it, and is constantly pretending that he is a paragon of consistency. Meanwhile nothing so fires the literary talents of a newspaper editor as to catch the great man being inconsistent. The statesman should refresh his courage from Walt Whitman: “Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself.”
这给一致性的概念带来了多么大的启发啊。与什么一致？在哪里？什么时候？使用以恒星距离为单位的房屋地段长度概念，只是为了保持一致，就会使有用的知识陷入停滞。在“扩展时间”领域中使用“本地时间”概念，只是为了保持一致，会使今天的人成为反爱因斯坦主义者，并且有些无知。同样，如果你愿意的话，将美国实行的言论自由概念强加给从未体验过美国各种言论自由的亚洲人民是一致的，但毫无意义。如果你在相似的环境中保持一致性，那么一致性就是瑰宝。如果你跳到其他时间和其他地方，它就会变成浆糊和彩色玻璃。如果在任期间情况发生变化，任何政治家都无法做到“始终如一”。由于不了解所涉及的语义概念，他彻夜不眠地担心它，并不断假装自己是一致性的典范。与此同时，没有什么比捕捉这位伟人前后矛盾更能激发报纸编辑的文学才华了。政治家应该从沃尔特·惠特曼那里重拾勇气：“我是否自相矛盾？好吧，那我就自相矛盾了。”
In addition to length, time, space, Bridgman describes modern concepts of velocity, force, mass, energy. temperature, light, quantum theory, identity, causality, all within the framework of operations. We have not time—or, if you prefer, we have not space—to examine them in any detail here. If the reader feels his curiosity aroused, he is earnestly advised to go to the original source.
除了长度、时间、空间之外，布里奇曼还描述了速度、力、质量、能量的现代概念。温度、光、量子理论、同一性、因果关系，所有这些都在操作的框架内。我们没有时间——或者，如果你愿意的话，我们没有空间——在这里详细研究它们。如果读者感到好奇，强烈建议他去查看原始资料。
Poincaré has spoken of the baleful effect of the word “heat” on physics. As it was grammatically classified among substances, physicists spent centuries looking for something in the outside world corresponding to heat—and quite neglecting the three pails of water described in Chapter 6. “Heat” is a symbol not for a thing, but for a relation. Here is a bar of steel. A thermometer shows its temperature to be 60°. One asks, “What is the temperature of an electron in the bar?” I answer smartly, “Sixty degrees.” You answer, more wisely, “I don’t know.” We are both in error. We have not shifted our talk to the electronic level. Temperature by scientific definition depends on molecular vibration, and to have temperature at all there must be at least two molecules. An electron is below this level and so has nothing to be called temperature in its make-up.
庞加莱谈到了“热”这个词对物理学的有害影响。由于它在语法上被归类为物质，物理学家花了几个世纪的时间在外部世界中寻找与热相对应的东西——而完全忽略了第六章中描述的三桶水。“热”不是一个事物的象征，而是一种关系的象征。这是一根钢筋。温度计显示温度为 60°。有人问：“棒中电子的温度是多少？”我聪明地回答：“六十度。”你更明智地回答：“我不知道。”我们都错了。我们还没有将我们的谈话转移到电子层面。科学定义的温度取决于分子振动，并且要具有温度必须至少有两个分子。电子低于这个水平，因此在其构成中没有什么可以称为温度。
We never experience light by itself as a thing. Our experience deals only with things lighted. Therefore light as an object traveling is very difficult to prove, and to date is more hypothesis than observed fact. Einstein assumed that light does travel by itself, but this concept may have to be modified. In the realms of quantum phenomena (behavior within the atom) the ordinary concepts of mechanics are inapplicable. So also are relativity mechanics. Electrons do not whirl like iron wheels. This is a new kind of experience. Like the kitten, we must be still, observe, and gradually form new concepts. Indeed, the laws of mechanics may be only the statistical gross effects of quantum activity, the “aggregate action of a great many elementary quantum processes.”
我们从来没有将光本身视为一个物体。我们的经验只涉及照亮的事物。因此，光作为物体的传播很难被证明，迄今为止更多的是假设而不是观察到的事实。爱因斯坦假设光确实会自行传播，但这个概念可能需要修改。在量子现象（原子内的行为）领域，普通的力学概念不适用。相对论力学也是如此。电子不像铁轮那样旋转。这是一种新的体验。我们必须像小猫一样，静下来，观察，逐渐形成新的概念。事实上，力学定律可能只是量子活动的统计总体效应，即“许多基本量子过程的聚合作用”。
I am not giving these illustrations in an attempt to teach you physics, to explain relativity, or to parade my grasp of science. I know very little about physics, but I am enormously interested in finding out how physicists handle concepts. Above other men in recent years, they have widened the boundaries of human knowledge. Forget the physics recited here, for it is negligible, but do not forget the way a modern physicist forms a concept; above all, do not forget the operational approach.
我提供这些插图并不是为了教你们物理学、解释相对论或炫耀我对科学的掌握。我对物理学知之甚少，但我对了解物理学家如何处理概念非常感兴趣。近年来，他们超越了其他人，拓宽了人类知识的边界。忘记这里背诵的物理学，因为它可以忽略不计，但不要忘记现代物理学家形成概念的方式；最重要的是，不要忘记操作方法。
Let us now turn to the problem of how scientists communicate what they discover. “The essence of an explanation,” says Bridgman, “consists in reducing a situation to elements with which we are so familiar that we accept them as a matter of course, so that our curiosity rests.” When you explain a thing to me and I understand it, what you have said checks with my past experience as per the filing system in my brain. “Yes, sir, that’s ? Thingumbob all right, I’ve seen a carload of them.” An explanation calls up a familiar correlation, but it is by no means “absolute truth.” Its validity depends on the hearer’s experience, which may be. limited. Perhaps I have never encountered a Thingumbob. Perhaps I have misinterpreted it. The explanation that a thunderstorm is caused by an angry god may be good enough for a Trobriand Islander. It is not good enough for a physicist. Bridgman notes three steps in reacting to new experience:
现在让我们转向科学家如何传达他们的发现的问题。布里奇曼说：“解释的本质在于将情况还原为我们非常熟悉的元素，以至于我们将它们视为理所当然，这样我们的好奇心就得到了满足。”当你向我解释一件事并且我理解它时，你所说的内容会根据我大脑中的归档系统与我过去的经验进行核对。 “是的，先生，那是？好吧，我已经看到了一车车了。”一种解释唤起了人们熟悉的相关性，但这绝不是“绝对真理”。它的有效性取决于听者的经验，这可能是。有限的。也许我从来没有遇到过Thingumbob。也许我误解了它。对于特罗布里恩岛民来说，雷暴是由愤怒的神引起的解释可能已经足够了。对于物理学家来说这还不够好。布里奇曼指出了对新体验做出反应的三个步骤：
If the experiment is not too far beyond the margin of known ground, it can be explained in concepts derived from past experience. Thus the kinetic theory of gases slid into focus without trouble.
如果实验没有超出已知范围太远，则可以用从过去经验得出的概念来解释它。因此，气体动力学理论毫无困难地成为人们关注的焦点。
If the experiment is well beyond the margin, an explanatory crisis develops. Relativity and quantum theory produced such crises. The human impulse is to force the new into the old molds and thus feel mentally relieved: “Einstein has discovered nothing new; Newton said it all long ago.” Such unwarranted explanations are pleasant for a time, but sooner or later they will be found out. “Society will not be able to demand permanently from the individual the acceptance of any conviction or creed which is not true, no matter what the gain in other ways to society.” (Reading this, I suddenly feel relieved about the fraudulent concepts—racial and national—which Hitler is trying to foist upon the people of Germany. Sooner or later their falsity will destroy them.)
如果实验远远超出了界限，就会出现解释性危机。相对论和量子理论产生了这样的危机。人类的本能就是将新事物强加于旧事物，从而获得精神上的解脱：“爱因斯坦没有发现任何新东西；牛顿很久以前就说过了。”这种毫无根据的解释一时令人愉快，但迟早会被发现。 “社会将无法永久要求个人接受任何不真实的信念或信条，无论以其他方式给社会带来什么好处。” （读到这里，我突然对希特勒试图强加给德国人民的欺骗性概念——种族和民族——感到宽慰。他们的虚假迟早会摧毁他们。）
The explanatory crisis can be faced squarely, just as the kitten faces it, with cautious investigation and an open mind. “All our knowledge is in terms of experience; we should not expect or desire to erect an explanatory structure different in character from that of experience. . . . But only bigots, unimaginative, obtuse and obstinate, demand that all experience must conform to familiar types.” Some physicists are still afflicted with this bigotry. Why? Partly because they were brought up on Newton and the splendor of his mechanical laws, partly because they are still slaves to bad language. “But just as the old monks struggled to subdue the flesh, so must the physicist struggle to subdue this sometimes nearly irresistible but perfectly unjustifiable desire.”
可以像小猫面对危机一样，以谨慎的调查和开放的心态来面对解释性危机。 “我们所有的知识都是经验；我们不应期望或渴望建立一种与经验不同的解释结构。 。 。 。但只有缺乏想象力、迟钝和固执的偏执狂才会要求所有经验都必须符合熟悉的类型。”一些物理学家仍然受到这种偏执的困扰。为什么？部分原因是他们是在牛顿及其辉煌的机械定律的熏陶下长大的，部分原因是他们仍然是脏话的奴隶。 “但正如老僧人努力征服肉体一样，物理学家也必须努力征服这种有时几乎不可抗拒但完全不合理的欲望。”
If physicists must become ascetics against the lures of absolutes, imagine the travail of a poor economist inured to little but wind for a lifetime. The great depression of 1929 was a slice of new experience as gigantic as it was tragic. Almost unanimously the economics faculty, energetically supported by President Hoover, announced that the depression was nothing new, that we had had plenty of them before—look at 1837 and 1893; that the same curve was always followed; and that it would probably all be over in ninety days. This forcing of the new into the mold of the old, this yearning for the familiar explanation, persisted throughout the catastrophe. For millions of Americans it is unshaken to this day.1 When President Roosevelt, like a modern physicist, tried to meet new experience with new experiment, he suffered an avalanche of bitter protest. The voters with small incomes were the scientists in the premises. Most of them kept on voting to allow him to seek new concepts for new experiences.
如果物理学家必须成为禁欲主义者，抵制绝对的诱惑，想象一下一个可怜的经济学家一生只适应风的痛苦。 1929 年的大萧条是一段新经历，既巨大又悲惨。在胡佛总统的大力支持下，经济学教授们几乎一致宣布，大萧条并不是什么新鲜事，我们以前经历过很多次大萧条——看看 1837 年和 1893 年；始终遵循相同的曲线；九十天内一切可能都会结束。这种将新事物强加于旧事物的模式，这种对熟悉的解释的渴望，在整个灾难中持续存在。对于数百万美国人来说，这一点至今仍没有动摇。1 当罗斯福总统像一位现代物理学家一样，试图通过新实验来迎接新经验时，他遭受了铺天盖地的强烈抗议。收入较低的选民是该场所的科学家。他们中的大多数人继续投票，让他能够寻求新概念、新体验。
Physicists are continually hunting for the fundamental bricks of the universe. It was recently thought that such a brick had been found in electrical charges. There is no justification for this tidy view, no experimental proof. The necessary operations have not been performed. The theory of relativity holds reasonably well for large dimensions in the outside world. The quantum theory holds reasonably well for small dimensions.1 At the borderland, the two theories clash. So the dogmatist leaps to the conclusion that both must be wrong, and that modern physics cannot be taken seriously. But just why must the universe be explained by one consistent universal law? Suppose it does not act that way in fact? Suppose that large-scale and small-scale events do follow different patterns? Suppose that we do live in several kinds of space at the same time? The fact that our minds want simple laws is no reason for supposing that nature must be simple. Will the concept work? Can another man repeat the operation? Here lies the determining factor for knowledge.
物理学家不断寻找宇宙的基本组成部分。最近人们认为在电荷中发现了这样的砖块。这种简洁的观点没有任何理由，也没有实验证明。尚未执行必要的操作。相对论对于外部世界的大维度来说相当有效。量子理论对于小维度来说相当适用。1在边界地带，两种理论发生冲突。因此，教条主义者立刻得出这样的结论：两者都一定是错误的，而且现代物理学不能被认真对待。但为什么宇宙必须用一个一致的普遍法则来解释呢？假设事实上它的行为并非如此呢？假设大规模和小规模事件确实遵循不同的模式？假设我们确实同时生活在几种空间中呢？我们的思想需要简单的法则这一事实并不能成为假设自然必须简单的理由。这个概念会起作用吗？另一个人可以重复这个操作吗？这就是知识的决定因素。
Attempts to simplify nature and reduce it to general laws have had a gloomy history. Newton’s mechanics, gravitation, thermodynamics, the principle of similitude the theory of ultimate rational units, are useful in certain contexts, but they do not unveil the whole world outside. “The task of finding concepts which shall adequately describe nature and at the same time be easily handled by us, is the most important and difficult of physics, and we never achieve more than approximate and temporary success.” Fortunate it is that nature does happen to disclose some simple, approximate rules over certain classes of phenomena that are good enough to allow us to build Boulder Dams and X-ray tubes. I wish we had some simple rules at least half as accurate to guide us in economics and politics.
简化自然并将其简化为一般规律的尝试有着一段悲惨的历史。牛顿的力学、万有引力、热力学、相似原理、终极有理单位理论，在某些情况下是有用的，但它们并没有揭示外面的整个世界。 “寻找能够充分描述自然并同时易于我们处理的概念的任务是物理学中最重要和最困难的任务，而我们只能取得近似和暂时的成功。”幸运的是，大自然确实对某些类型的现象揭示了一些简单、近似的规则，这些规则足以让我们建造博尔德水坝和 X 射线管。我希望我们有一些简单的规则，至少有一半的准确性来指导我们在经济和政治方面的发展。
What is the ultimate nature of matter? The question we know by now is meaningless. It would make layman as well as physicist feel better to answer it—even as the idea of God makes some people feel better. How does the outside world work in a given context, approximately? That seems to be the sum and quest of human knowledge. It will give us as much power over the environment as we are competent to handle.
物质的终极本质是什么？我们现在所知道的问题毫无意义。回答这个问题会让外行和物理学家感觉更好——就像上帝的想法让一些人感觉更好一样。在给定的环境下，外部世界大约是如何运作的？这似乎就是人类知识的总和和追求。它将赋予我们尽可能多的控制环境的能力。
I have taught you very little physics, but I trust I have told you enough to make it clear that Einstein has not shunted science into ghostly realms where “Everything is electricity—electricity is unknown—therefore everything is unknown;” where “Science has banished materialism and spiritualism has returned to the hearts of men.” Gibberish of this nature has been prevalent when nonscientific people have discussed modern physics. It is a mixture of ignorance, wishful thinking, and bad language. By getting rid of absolutes, the scientific method stands on the firmest ground in its history. It is sad that some of the older scientists cannot give up their fixed ideas and accept the gain which has been made.
我教给你的物理知识很少，但我相信我已经告诉你足够多的内容，足以让你明白爱因斯坦并没有将科学带入“一切都是电——电是未知的——因此一切都是未知的”的幽灵领域；在那里，“科学已经驱逐了唯物主义，唯灵论又回到了人们的心中。”当非科学人士讨论现代物理学时，这种性质的胡言乱语已经很普遍了。它是无知、一厢情愿和脏话的混合体。通过摆脱绝对性，科学方法在其历史上站稳了脚跟。令人遗憾的是，一些老一辈的科学家无法放弃自己的固定观念，接受已经取得的成果。
Einstein brought us closer to the world outside, thrusting aside the barriers of the observer’s senses. We have a like task in the social studies, the outside world of behaving human beings. Our problem is to see Germany, see Spain, see big business, see money and credit, see poverty and unemployment, see modern technology, not as entities walking, but as their referents really order themselves. Our task is to thrust aside dogma, one-valued judgments, untenable identifications, and so come closer to what is actually going on beyond our skins. We cannot, alas! bring these matters into the laboratory as the scientist can bring cosmic rays, but we can learn to use our minds like scientists. We can adopt the operational approach; we can appreciate the flexibility of concepts; we can avoid fraudulent explanations of the new in terms of the old; above all, we can strive for the great discipline of agreement.
爱因斯坦打破了观察者感官的障碍，让我们更接近外部世界。我们在社会研究中也有类似的任务，即人类行为的外部世界。我们的问题是看待德国、西班牙、大企业、货币和信贷、贫困和失业、现代技术，而不是行走的实体，而是它们的参照物真正在秩序自己。我们的任务是抛开教条、单一价值判断、站不住脚的认同，从而更接近我们皮肤之外实际发生的事情。我们不能，唉！将这些物质带入实验室，就像科学家可以带宇宙射线一样，但我们可以学会像科学家一样使用我们的思想。我们可以采取操作性的方法；我们可以欣赏概念的灵活性；我们可以避免用旧的来解释新的；最重要的是，我们可以努力达成一致的严格纪律。
By long and painful experience I have learned that a tennis ball goes harder and straighter to its destination when one has a rocking balance, swaying from foot tc foot like a dancer, with muscles flexible and relaxed. When a rigid position is taken, muscles tense, weight firmly planted on both feet, the fearful wallop one gives the ball usually sends it over the backstop or lamely into the net. We need flexible concepts as well as flexible bodies to meet the outside world.
通过长期痛苦的经验，我了解到，当一个人拥有摇摆平衡，像舞者一样从脚到脚摇摆，肌肉灵活而放松时，网球会更努力、更直地到达目的地。当采取僵硬的姿势时，肌肉紧张，重量牢牢地压在双脚上，球所发出的可怕的冲击力通常会将球送过挡网或跛行入网。我们需要灵活的观念，也需要灵活的身体来迎接外部世界。
Modern physics has rung down the curtain on absolutes. Scientists now devote themselves more to cutting into the margin of the unknown than to framing eternal laws. The semantic discipline has a kindred aim. It is not an absolute, but only a useful method for cutting into the margin of opaque language, making communication clearer. It cannot clear up all talk. There are blind spots in Korzybski, in Ogden, in Bridgman. The book you are reading has many of them. Presently, on these foundations, somebody will come along and give the study another forward push—progressively narrowing the margin of the unknown.
现代物理学已经拉开了绝对论的帷幕。科学家们现在更多地致力于探索未知的边缘，而不是制定永恒的法则。语义学科有着相似的目标。它不是绝对的，而只是一种切入不透明语言边缘、使沟通更清晰的有用方法。它不能澄清所有的谈话。科尔日布斯基、奥格登、布里奇曼都存在盲点。你正在读的书里有很多这样的内容。目前，在这些基础上，有人会出现并再次推动这项研究——逐渐缩小未知的范围。

THE LANGUAGE OF MATHEMATICS
数学语言
YOUR grandfather leaves $5,000 to you and your sister. The will provides that she is to receive $650 more than you receive. How will you tell her how much she is to get? In ordinary language you can shuffle the figures around and after a time find the answer. But by using mathematical language you can communicate the news much more quickly and accurately. Let x be your share. Then x + 650 is her share. Both shares equal $5,000. Making an equation or a mathematical sentence of these statements:
你的祖父给你和你的妹妹留下了 5,000 美元。遗嘱规定她将比您多收到 650 美元。你如何告诉她她要得到多少钱？用普通语言，你可以将数字打乱，一段时间后找到答案。但通过使用数学语言，您可以更快、更准确地传达新闻。让 x 成为你的份额。那么x+650就是她的份额。两股均等值 5,000 美元。用这些陈述建立一个方程式或一个数学句子：
Adding the shares for proof 5000
添加证明 5000 的股份
Mathematics has been called the language of science. This is not quite accurate. Each branch of science has also an argot of its own, and as we have seen, even physicists often use ordinary language like the rest of us. Some scientific concepts, however, cannot be communicated except in mathematical terms. This is the case with the central concept of relativity. You must know some calculus to grasp it and make it your own. Many books have been advertised as reducing Einstein to simple terms which “any intelligent layman can understand.” Strictly speaking, the blurb if not the book is fraudulent. One does not understand a story in Russian just because it is written in words of one syllable.
数学被称为科学的语言。这不太准确。每个科学分支都有自己的行话，正如我们所见，即使是物理学家也经常像我们其他人一样使用普通语言。然而，一些科学概念只能用数学术语来传达。相对论的中心概念就是这种情况。您必须了解一些微积分才能掌握它并使其成为您自己的。许多书籍都被宣传为将爱因斯坦简化为“任何聪明的外行人都能理解的”简单术语。严格来说，如果不是这本书的话，那是欺诈性的。人们不能仅仅因为俄语故事是用一个音节的单词写成的而理解它。
A similar situation holds for quantum theory. Ordinary language is not adapted to describe processes within the atom. It is adapted to deal with everyday processes involving exceedingly large numbers of atoms. To talk about what is happening inside one atom, a special language is required.
量子理论也存在类似的情况。普通语言不适合描述原子内的过程。它适合处理涉及大量原子的日常过程。要谈论一个原子内部发生的事情，需要一种特殊的语言。
Must we all turn mathematicians, then, to understand our world? No. But two important observations are in order. For some of the more complicated aspects of nature, mathematics provides the only key; for everyday activities in the Power Age, mathematics provides a very useful aid to clear thinking. Even if one does not master higher mathematics, a knowledge of what this language is about—how it developed, and the ability to handle a little algebra and geometry, to plot a few simple graphs—is worth having. It helps to solve many problems of communication and meaning.
那么，我们都必须成为数学家才能理解我们的世界吗？不。但是有两个重要的观察结果是合理的。对于自然的一些更复杂的方面，数学提供了唯一的钥匙；对于电力时代的日常活动，数学为清晰思维提供了非常有用的帮助。即使一个人不掌握高等数学，了解这种语言的含义——它是如何发展的，以及处理一点代数和几何、绘制一些简单图表的能力——也是值得拥有的。它有助于解决许多沟通和意义问题。
One of the pleasantest ways I know to obtain this knowledge is to read Lancelot Hogben’s Mathematics for the Million. It is not guaranteed painless, but the fact that it has been an outstanding best-seller both here and in England is evidence of its human and practical value. Mathematics, he says, began in the nomadic age to fill a need. It was necessary to count herds and flocks to keep them straight. When agriculture was developed, it became essential to measure crop lands. We have already noted how the Nile washed out boundary marks every spring and encouraged a science of land measure, or geometry. Recurring seasons for planting, harvesting, high-water periods, demanded an accurate calendar, and for this astronomical measurements had to be taken. Many of the first writings were calendar notations. I have seen beautiful examples of such stone writings on Maya stelae in Mexican jungles. As cities grew, timekeeping became essential, and mathematics was broadened to count the hours. The building of temples, especially pyramids, required careful measurements and a geometry of solids. How much stone must be quarried for a truncated pyramid of such and such size? When corn and wine were bartered or sold, standard measurements were essential, so that neither party would be defrauded. Presently galleys and ships began to take journeys beyond sight of land, and navigation was demanded.
据我所知，获得这些知识的最愉快的方法之一是阅读兰斯洛特·霍格本的《百万人的数学》。虽然不能保证它不会带来任何痛苦，但它在英国和英国都成为杰出畅销书的事实证明了它的人文价值和实用价值。他说，数学始于游牧时代，是为了满足某种需要。有必要清点牛群和羊群的数量，以保持它们的整齐。当农业发达时，测量农田就变得至关重要。我们已经注意到尼罗河每年春天如何冲刷边界标记并鼓励土地测量或几何科学。播种、收获、丰水期的重复季节需要精确的日历，为此必须进行天文测量。许多最早的著作都是日历符号。我在墨西哥丛林的玛雅石碑上看到过这种石刻文字的美丽例子。随着城市的发展，计时变得至关重要，数学的范围也扩大到了计算时间。寺庙的建造，尤其是金字塔，需要仔细的测量和固体的几何形状。建造一个这样大小的截头金字塔需要开采多少石头？当玉米和葡萄酒进行易货或出售时，标准尺寸是必不可少的，这样双方都不会被欺骗。不久，桨帆船和轮船开始在看不见的陆地上航行，因此需要导航。
How human this is. Some Heavy Thinker of ancient times did not begin by sitting in his portico and evolving numbers and planes and truncated pyramids out of his head, to plague children in schoolrooms forevermore. The numbers and planes came out of the need of shepherds, farmers, traders, builders—out of the day-by-day life of the people. They came without mystery but not without a kind of mental revolution. Bertrand Russell has observed that it must have taken many ages to discover that a brace of partridges and a couple of days are both instances of the number 2.
这是多么人性啊。古代的一些深思熟虑的人并不是一开始就坐在门廊里，从他的脑海中演化出数字、平面和截头金字塔，永远困扰着教室里的孩子们。这些数字和飞机是出于牧羊人、农民、商人、建筑商的需要——来自人们的日常生活。他们的到来并不神秘，但也并非没有一场精神革命。伯特兰·罗素（Bertrand Russell）观察到，一定要花很多年才能发现一对鹧鸪和几天都是数字 2 的实例。
Certain Greek philosophers took this useful tool and made a dull fetish out of it. They lifted it from the market place and put it in the cloister. They believed bedrock had been reached when they had isolated a point, a line, an angle—something changeless, timeless, eternal. From these absolutes, truth could be reared by reason. The intellectuals of Athens and Alexandria rarely examined the sort of things about which these words can be intelligently used. They dealt with pure theory, not with a living world. In Euclid the analysis of flatness reached its climax, so perfect and often so unreal that it has been a major educational subject ever since. No wonder so many schoolboys are bored by geometry; it connects with nothing in their experience, and no meaning comes through. Euclid was a great man, and his geometry is useful in limited contexts. The objection raised by Hogben is to the worship of Euclid’s valuable findings as truth, good everywhere, for everything, at all times. The word “worship” is used advisedly. A noted divine once wrote a book proving to his own satisfaction that if you destroy Euclid, you necessarily destroy the revealed word of God. Nobody can destroy Euclid. All that can be done is to put his work in the place where it functions and keep it out of places where it does not function. If Einstein had stuck to Euclidian geometry, relativity would never have been heard of.
某些希腊哲学家利用了这一有用的工具，并对它进行了沉闷的崇拜。他们把它从市场上抬起来，放在回廊里。他们相信，当他们分离出一个点、一条线、一个角度——某种不变的、永恒的、永恒的东西时，就已经到达了基岩。从这些绝对的事物中，真理可以通过理性产生。雅典和亚历山大的知识分子很少研究可以明智地使用这些词的事物。他们研究的是纯粹的理论，而不是现实世界。在欧几里得那里，对平面的分析达到了顶峰，它是如此完美，但往往如此不真实，以至于从那时起它就成为了一个主要的教育主题。难怪这么多学生对几何感到厌烦。它与他们的经历没有任何联系，也没有任何意义。欧几里得是一位伟人，他的几何学在有限的环境中很有用。霍格本提出的反对意见是崇拜欧几里得的宝贵发现，将其视为真理，无论何时何地都是善的。 “敬拜”这个词的使用是经过深思熟虑的。一位著名的神学家曾经写过一本书，他自己满意地证明，如果你摧毁了欧几里得，你就必然摧毁了上帝所启示的话语。没有人能摧毁欧几里得。能做的就是把他的工作放在它发挥作用的地方，而把它放在它不起作用的地方。如果爱因斯坦坚持欧几里得几何学，相对论就不会被听说过。
Pythagoras formulated some excellent mathematics more than a century before Euclid. He also made a major contribution to the technique of human knowledge by working out the concept of “proof.” He insisted that assumptions or postulates must first be set down clearly. No extraneous matter must be subsequently introduced. Proof is arrived at by applying close deductive reasoning to the postulates. Having thus immortalized himself, Pythagoras went off into the blind alley of magic numbers, and founded a whole school which stood in awe of the portents and omens of 7’s and 11’s. “Bless us, divine Number, thou who generatest gods and men.” Some people today still cower before the number 13.
毕达哥拉斯比欧几里得早一个多世纪就提出了一些优秀的数学。他还提出了“证明”的概念，对人类知识技术做出了重大贡献。他坚持认为，首先必须明确提出假设或假设。随后不得引入任何无关物质。通过对假设进行严密的演绎推理来得出证明。毕达哥拉斯由此使自己永垂不朽，他走进了魔法数字的死胡同，并建立了一整套学派，对 7 和 11 的预兆和征兆感到敬畏。 “保佑我们，神圣的数字，你创造了众神和人类。”时至今日，仍有一些人在“13”这个数字面前畏缩不前。
The abacus or counting frame was invented to do sums in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. One can still see this device in active use in Russia or at a Chinese laundry. Ic consists of little balls on wires which one pushes around, “carrying over” from one line to the next. The ancients did not know how to do sums on paper; fractions were avoided, decimal points unheard of. One counted on one’s fingers or used the abacus. It was tedious work. Not until long after the fall of the Roman Empire did Western countries adopt the Arabic zero, the sign for the “empty” column of numbers, together with the rudiments of algebra. The zero and Arabic numerals produced a revolution more important than that of the printing press. They liberated mankind from the prison bars of the abacus. The revolution was not, however, unopposed. An edict of 1259 forbade the bankers of Florence to use the infidel symbols. The bankers must still write four characters for 8 (VIII), six characters for 48 (XLVIII), fifteen for 3,888 (MMMDCCCLXXXVIII) . But by using pencil, paper, and the decimal point which the zero permitted, merchants could solve in minutes sums which used to take hours. The electric adding machine is a great improvement over pencil ana paper, but it is as nothing compared to the improvement in mental machinery provided by the zero. Observe also the increased efficiency of algebraic symbols:
算盘或计数框架的发明是为了进行加、减、乘、除运算。人们仍然可以在俄罗斯或中国的洗衣店看到这一设备的活跃使用。 Ic 由电线上的小球组成，人们可以推动这些小球，从一根线“携带”到另一根线。古人不知道如何在纸上算术；避免使用分数，小数点更是闻所未闻。人们用手指或算盘来数。这是一项乏味的工作。直到罗马帝国灭亡后不久，西方国家才采用了阿拉伯数字零（数字“空”列的符号）以及代数的基础知识。零和阿拉伯数字引发了一场比印刷机更重要的革命。他们将人类从算盘的牢笼中解放出来。然而，这场革命并非没有遭到反对。 1259 年的一项法令禁止佛罗伦萨的银行家使用异教徒符号。银行家仍必须为 8 (VIII) 写出 4 个字符，为 48 (XLVIII) 写出 6 个字符，为 3,888 (MMMDCCCLXXXVIII) 写出 15 个字符。但是，通过使用铅笔、纸和零允许的小数点，商人可以在几分钟内算出过去需要几个小时的数字。电动加法机相对于铅笔和纸来说是一个巨大的进步，但与零所提供的心理机制的改进相比，它就微不足道了。还可以观察代数符号效率的提高：
Before algebraic symbols: 3 census et 6 demptis 5 rebus aequatur zero
代数符号之前： 3 census et 6 demptis 5 rebus aequatur 0
After: 3x2 - 5x + 6 = 0
之后：3x2 - 5x + 6 = 0
Observe also that the algebra is direct shorthand translation of longhand talk, a tidier, defter language, not something incomprehensible out of the sky. Slang sometimes performs a similar service: rather than “Disperse yourselves as rapidly as possible,” the American policeman remarks laconically, “Scram!”
还要观察到，代数是手语交谈的直接速记翻译，是一种更简洁、更灵活的语言，而不是天上掉下来的难以理解的东西。俚语有时也能起到类似的作用：美国警察不是“尽快散开”，而是简洁地说：“滚开！”
When early observers could not readily express their measurements in everyday language, they were driven to experiment with symbols. If further observations were inexpressible in the symbols available, new symbols were sought. Thus Newton was stumped to tell the world or even himself what he had discovered about the movement of celestial bodies until he had perfected the differential calculus, which is an admirable language for accurately expressing movement. Thus Gauss was forced to perfect co-ordinates and the integral calculus. So Lobatchevsky in 1826 invented symbols to express non-Euclidian geometry; so Einstein applied and improved the calculus of tensors—not to drive us crazy, but to meet a genuine need. We noted earlier how everyday language has developed by a process of filling the gaps, supplying a new word to take the place of a long, clumsy description. Mathematics has followed a similar course. Furthermore, as Bell points out:
当早期的观察者无法轻易地用日常语言表达他们的测量结果时，他们被迫尝试使用符号。如果可用符号无法表达进一步的观察，则寻找新的符号。因此，牛顿很难告诉世界，甚至他自己，他对天体运动的发现，直到他完善了微分学，这是一种精确表达运动的令人钦佩的语言。因此高斯被迫完善坐标和积分。于是洛巴切夫斯基在1826年发明了符号来表达非欧几里得几何；因此爱因斯坦应用并改进了张量微积分——不是为了让我们发疯，而是为了满足真正的需要。我们之前注意到日常语言是如何通过填补空白、提供新词来代替冗长、笨拙的描述的过程而发展起来的。数学也遵循类似的过程。此外，正如贝尔指出的：
One significant fact stares us in the face. Mathematics is the inexhaustible matrix of new development in the art of thinking. When it declines, close reasoning petrifies into stereotyped and unimaginative repetition of the classics.
一个重要的事实摆在我们面前。数学是思维艺术新发展的取之不尽、用之不竭的矩阵。当它衰落时，严密的推理就会僵化为对经典的刻板和缺乏想象力的重复。
The Middle Ages was such a period of petrifaction.
中世纪就是这样一个石化的时期。
Hogben calls ordinary speech a language of “sorts,” and mathematics a language of “size.” The writing of sort language was once a mystery closely monopolized by priests. The time has come, he says, for another Reformation like that of five hundred years ago when the priestly monopoly was broken, and the mass of the people were permitted to read the Bible and learn to write themselves. Most people today can neither read nor write size language, yet the world they live in depends upon it. Without mathematics there would be no electric power, no steel bridges, no public statistics, no railroads, automobiles or telephones. Without the theory of analytic functions we could not study temperatures or the flow of electricity, and so control them. Without such numbers as √−1 in vector algebra we could not have learned how to build radios or to send telegrams. Without multidimensional geometry we could not construct automobile engines or deal with gases under pressure.
霍格本称普通言语为“种类”语言，而数学为“规模”语言。某种语言的书写曾经是一个被牧师严格垄断的谜。他说，像五百年前那样的宗教改革的时机已经到来，当时牧师的垄断被打破，人民大众被允许阅读圣经并学习自己写作。今天，大多数人既不能读也不能写大小语言，但他们生活的世界却依赖于这种语言。没有数学，就不会有电力、钢桥、公共统计、铁路、汽车或电话。如果没有解析函数理论，我们就无法研究温度或电流，从而控制它们。如果没有矢量代数中的 √−1 这样的数字，我们就不可能学会如何建造无线电或发送电报。如果没有多维几何学，我们就无法建造汽车发动机或处理压力下的气体。
We need to know at least the rudiments of mathematics in sheer self-defense. No society is safe in the hands of priests. Think of the mathematical accompaniment of our daily life: timetables, unemployment figures, insurance based on actuarial computations, taxes, debts, interest, wage rates, pensions, old-age security legislation, bond yields, speed limits, betting odds, baseball averages, football gaining and scoring, calories, weights, temperatures, rainfall, meter readings, radio wave lengths, tire pressures, freight charges, calculation of flood crests, birth rates, death rates. . . . Little of this was essential in Athens, Alexandria, or Rome. With greater urgency than ever before, the mathematician and the plain man need to understand each other. Without a knowledge of the grammar of size and order, we cannot hope to plan an age of plenty. Priests and pundits will prove that it cannot be done and we shall have to submit, unless we know the hocus-pocus in the proof.
出于纯粹的自卫，我们至少需要了解数学的基础知识。在牧师的手中，没有哪个社会是安全的。想想我们日常生活中的数学陪伴：时间表、失业数字、基于精算计算的保险、税收、债务、利息、工资率、养老金、老年保障立法、债券收益率、速度限制、投注赔率、棒球平均数、足球得分和得分、卡路里、体重、温度、降雨量、仪表读数、无线电波长、轮胎压力、运费、洪水顶峰计算、出生率、死亡率。 。 。 。这些对于雅典、亚历山大或罗马来说并不重要。数学家和普通人比以往任何时候都更需要相互理解。如果不了解规模和秩序的语法，我们就无法计划一个富裕的时代。牧师和专家将证明这是不可能的，我们将不得不屈服，除非我们知道证明中的骗术。
Modern engineering is possible because of the similarity in structure between mathematics and the outside world. With confidence we rely upon the structural abstractions which engineers employ to build skyscrapers, bridges, motorcars, and airplanes. A large part of modern behavior, many social institutions, are dependent upon the engineers’ ability to predict what will happen when steel and stone and chemicals are combined thus and so. Without such sureness, bridges might collapse, Boulder Dams might fail. Upon predictability of this nature modern “civilization” has been built.
现代工程之所以成为可能，是因为数学与外部世界在结构上的相似性。我们满怀信心地依靠工程师用来建造摩天大楼、桥梁、汽车和飞机的结构抽象。现代行为的很大一部分，许多社会制度，都依赖于工程师预测当钢铁、石头和化学品如此如此组合时会发生什么的能力。如果没有这样的确定性，桥梁可能会倒塌，博尔德水坝可能会崩溃。现代“文明”就建立在这种性质的可预测性之上。
Predictability, observes Dr. D. G. Campbell, depends upon the discovery of structure, the representation of that structure by a language with similar structural characteristics, and then the manipulation of the symbols of that language to determine what will happen under the conditions of such structural arrangements in the future. It is like a miniature stage used by a stage designer to study lights and color, like a wind tunnel for testing airplane design, like the tank which Starling Burgess uses for testing models of cup-defender yachts. A mathematician, for instance, predicts torsion stresses in a steel bar by measuring stresses in a soap film in which he finds characteristics of similar structure. Relationships are similar and may be represented by mathematical symbols of relationship. Laborious methods of trial and error become unnecessary. From a few measurements, structure in the soap film is discovered; a language corresponding to the structure is utilized; predictability of the behavior of steel bars is made possible.
DG Campbell 博士认为，可预测性取决于结构的发现、用具有相似结构特征的语言来表示该结构，然后对该语言的符号进行操作，以确定在这种结构安排的条件下会发生什么将来。它就像舞台设计师用来研究灯光和色彩的微型舞台，就像测试飞机设计的风洞，就像斯塔林·伯吉斯用来测试杯卫士游艇模型的坦克。例如，一位数学家通过测量肥皂膜中的应力来预测钢筋中的扭转应力，在肥皂膜中他发现了类似结构的特征。关系是相似的并且可以用关系的数学符号来表示。费力的试错方法变得不必要。通过几次测量，我们发现了肥皂膜的结构；使用与该结构相对应的语言；使钢筋行为的可预测性成为可能。
But no man alive predicted the great depression of 1929 with any structural knowledge to support him, and no man knows surely when the next collapse will come.
但没有一个活着的人能用任何结构性知识来支持他预测 1929 年的大萧条，也没有人确切知道下一次崩溃何时到来。
Let us follow Hogben in a few simple exercises in translating mathematics into ordinary language:
让我们跟随霍格本进行一些简单的练习，将数学翻译成普通语言：
Area equals length times breadth. In the language of mathematics, this sentence reads:
面积等于长度乘以宽度。用数学的语言来说，这句话是这样的：
A = 1 × b
A = 1 × b
X and = are the verbs in this expression, while the nouns are A, I and b. Comparing the two languages:
X 和 = 是该表达式中的动词，而名词是 A、I 和 b。比较两种语言：
Ordinary language Mathematical language
普通语言 数学语言
The length l
长度l
must be multiplied by X
必须乘以 X
the breadth b
宽度b
to get a measure of =
测量 =
the area A
A区
Observe the saving in time and space. Observe further that in algebraic symbols of this kind no actual objects, no referents in the world outside, are included. Mathematics is a language of action and relation. But it is easy to supply referents for the sentence above by measuring your kitchen floor in square units. The equation gives orders and relations which must be obeyed. You are not to multiply area by length to get breadth; you follow the rules. Then it is possible to substitute yards or feet or kilometers to apply to oblongs anywhere (within the confines of this “length” concept) and get an answer for what you want to know.
观察时间和空间的节省。进一步观察，在这种代数符号中，不包括任何实际物体，也不包括外部世界的指示物。数学是一种行动和关系的语言。但是，通过以平方单位测量厨房地板，可以很容易地为上面的句子提供参考。该方程给出了必须遵守的顺序和关系。你不能用面积乘以长度来得到宽度；你遵守规则。然后就可以用码、英尺或公里来代替任何地方的长方形（在这个“长度”概念的范围内），并得到你想知道的答案。
You must be careful, however, to deal in similar units, always yards, or always kilometers, in this equation. You must not multiply yards by kilometers, must not add yards to gallons, or you will create a mathematical monster. Before you know it, you will be preparing indices of wholesale prices for the guidance of economists and statesmen.
然而，您必须小心处理类似的单位，在这个等式中总是码或总是公里。你不能将码乘以公里，也不能将码乘以加仑，否则你会创造出一个数学怪物。在不知不觉中，您将准备批发价格指数以供经济学家和政治家指导。
Everyday language contains gerunds, or noun and verb combined in one word, as in “working.” Gerunds are also found in mathematics in such symbols as −3, or √−1, which are numbers with direction attached to them by convention. We find conjunctions: ∴ (therefore) and ∵ (because). The verbs + and − were originally chalked on bales in warehouses to show surplus or short weight. In using these verbs with referents attached we must again be careful not to add or subtract dissimilar things. Two boys + 10 green apples do not foot up to anything—except possibly a couple of stomachaches. This warning has been called the “rule of quantitative similarity.”
日常语言包含动名词，或名词和动词组合成一个词，如“工作”。动名词在数学中也以 −3 或 √−1 等符号出现，这些数字按照惯例带有方向。我们找到连词：∴（因此）和 ∵（因为）。动词 + 和 − 最初是用粉笔写在仓库的捆包上，以显示剩余或短缺的重量。在使用这些带有所指对象的动词时，我们必须再次小心，不要添加或减少不同的事物。两个男孩加上 10 个青苹果根本无法应付任何事情——除了可能有几次胃痛。这一警告被称为“数量相似性规则”。
There are collective nouns in mathematics, but nothing corresponding to the high-order abstractions in everyday language. Capital letters of the alphabet are used, like A or M, to symbolize whole families of numbers having something definite in common. Area, or A, must translate into square units—inches, or feet, or kilometers. This makes it difficult to create fictional entities without observable referents. Mathematics is a powerful corrective for the spook-making of ordinary language. The term “elegant” is frequently applied to mathematical style. It means that rotundities have been removed by the process of elimination. “In the international language of mathematics, we sacrifice everything to making the statement as clear as possible.”
数学中有集体名词，但没有与日常语言中的高阶抽象相对应的。使用字母表中的大写字母（例如 A 或 M）来表示具有明确共同点的整个数字系列。面积或 A 必须转换为平方单位——英寸、英尺或公里。这使得在没有可观察指示物的情况下创建虚构实体变得困难。数学对于日常语言的恐怖行为具有强大的纠正作用。 “优雅”一词经常用于数学风格。这意味着圆形已经通过消除过程消除了。 “用国际数学语言来说，我们牺牲一切来使陈述尽可能清晰。”
Suppose we translate into mathematics the famous problem with which Zeno baffled the Greek logicians. Zeno said that if Achilles allowed a tortoise a head start in a race, no matter how much faster Achilles ran, he could never overtake the tortoise. Why? Because he must first reach the place where the tortoise was when Achilles started. By the time he reaches it, the tortoise, however slow, has made some progress. So Achilles must reach this second place. But by the time he gets there, the tortoise has moved to a third place still ahead, and so on ad infinitum. The distance between them ever narrows, but Achilles can never overcome it. When last seen, to paraphrase Bell, the tortoise was .000005 of an inch ahead and Achilles’ tongue was hanging out half a yard.
假设我们将芝诺困扰希腊逻辑学家的著名问题转化为数学。芝诺说，如果阿基里斯在比赛中让乌龟领先，那么无论阿基里斯跑得多快，他都永远无法超越乌龟。为什么？因为他必须先到达阿喀琉斯出发时乌龟所在的地方。当他到达目的地时，乌龟虽然进展缓慢，但已经取得了一些进展。所以阿喀琉斯必须到达第二位。但当他到达那里时，乌龟已经移动到第三位，仍然领先，如此循环往复。他们之间的距离不断缩小，但阿喀琉斯永远无法克服它。用贝尔的话来说，最后一次出现时，乌龟领先 0.000005 英寸，而阿喀琉斯的舌头伸出了半码。
Dealing in words alone, the logic is unimpeachable. Let it whirl around your cortex from reference to symbol and the chances are that you will be unable to discover anything wrong with it. You may settle yourself in an armchair and think until kingdom come, or until you go mad, and you cannot get around it. But the moment you begin to look for referents, to perform an operation, to place an actual turtle here, and a young athlete there, and start them off, the mental blockage dissolves. When I hear a problem of this nature, my impulse is to reach for a pencil and paper, and undoubtedly you share this impulse. It is a sign of semantic progress. The ancients had no scribbling paper and no adequate symbols for attacking such problems. They knew of course that Achilles could lick the tar out of the tortoise, but how were they to prove it? Here are two simple methods of translation unknown to the Greeks.
单从文字上来说，逻辑是无懈可击的。让它在你的大脑皮层中从参考到符号旋转，你很可能无法发现它有什么问题。你可能会坐在扶手椅上思考，直到天国来临，或者直到你发疯，而你却无法回避它。但当你开始寻找参照物、进行手术、在这里放置一只真正的乌龟、在那里放置一名年轻运动员并让他们开始时，精神障碍就会消失。当我听到这种性质的问题时，我的冲动就是伸手去拿铅笔和纸，毫无疑问，你也有这种冲动。这是语义进步的标志。古人没有书写纸，也没有足够的符号来解决此类问题。他们当然知道阿喀琉斯可以把乌龟身上的焦油舔掉，但是他们如何证明这一点呢？这里有两种希腊人不知道的简单翻译方法。

In this mathematical language of graphs we draw the rate at which the tortoise moves and the rate of Achilles, and where the two lines meet the tortoise is overtaken. Assuming that the tortoise can run a yard a second, that Achilles runs ten times as fast and gives the tortoise a start of 100 seconds, they will meet 111.11 yards down the track. It does not make any difference what rates are taken so long as the tortoise starts first and Achilles runs faster. The slope of the lines will change, but the meeting-point will always appear.
在这种图形的数学语言中，我们绘制了乌龟移动的速率和跟腱的速率，以及两条线相交的地方乌龟被超越。假设乌龟每秒能跑一码，阿喀琉斯跑得快十倍，并给乌龟起步时间为 100 秒，他们将在跑道上相遇 111.11 码。只要乌龟先出发，而阿喀琉斯跑得更快，采取什么速度都没有任何区别。线条的斜率会改变，但交汇点总会出现。
With the same assumptions, let us translate the problem into simple algebra. Let r be the rate of the tortoise. Then Achilles’ rate will be 10r. Let x be the time in seconds taken by the tortoise before they meet. We know that the distance traveled by the tortoise equals the distance traveled by Achilles. The distance a body travels is its rate of travel multiplied by the time traveled. Using this formula:
使用相同的假设，让我们将问题转化为简单的代数。令 r 为乌龟的速度。那么阿基里斯的速率将为 10r。设 x 为乌龟相遇之前所用的时间（以秒为单位）。我们知道乌龟走过的距离等于阿喀琉斯走过的距离。物体移动的距离是其移动速度乘以移动时间。使用这个公式：
They will meet 111.11 seconds after the tortoise starts, or 111.11 yards down the course, as in the graph. Incidentally, most algebra can be translated into graphs, with curved lines for higher powers of x. Engineers ire very partial to graph language. The Greeks had no algebra, no graphical methods, while the geometry of Euclid which they did possess dealt only in spaces and made no allowance for times. Motion, rates of motion, velocity, could not be handled. So you see in what a predicament the logicians found themselves when Zeno, perhaps with an ironical smile, put the problem before them.
他们将在乌龟出发后 111.11 秒相遇，或者在距离路线 111.11 码处相遇，如图所示。顺便说一句，大多数代数都可以转化为图表，其中曲线代表更高的 x 次方。工程师非常偏爱图形语言。希腊人没有代数，没有图形方法，而他们所拥有的欧几里得几何学只涉及空间，不考虑时间。无法处理运动、运动速率、速度。所以你可以看到，当芝诺（也许带着讽刺的微笑）将问题摆在逻辑学家面前时，他们发现自己陷入了多么困境。
At this point a little journey through the fourth dimension with Bell may prove enlightening. Suppose you want to identify and label all the men in Middletown. For each man you ask (1) his age in years, (2) his height in inches, (3) his weight in pounds, (4) dollars in his pocket or bank. You allot a symbol for each characteristic: A for age, H for height, W for weight, D for dollars, and rigorously maintain the order. Having got your facts together, any man can be accurately and quickly identified as follows:
在这一点上，与贝尔一起穿越第四维度的一小段旅程可能会有所启发。假设您想要识别并标记米德尔敦的所有男性。对于每个人，你询问（1）他的年龄（以岁为单位），（2）他的身高（以英寸为单位），（3）他的体重（以磅为单位），（4）他口袋或银行里的美元。您为每个特征分配一个符号：A 代表年龄，H 代表身高，W 代表体重，D 代表美元，并严格保持顺序。综合所有事实后，可以准确、快速地识别任何人，如下所示：
A H W D
AHWD
William Black 35 60 160 2
威廉·布莱克 35 60 160 2
Arthur White 42 68 135 10,000
阿瑟·怀特 42 68 135 10,000
Black, then, is 35 years old, 60 inches tall, weighs 160, and has $2. White is 42, 68 inches tall, weighs 135, and has $ 10,000. The set of labels A, H, W, D is a simple kind of four-dimensional manifold—a term which has long terrorized the nonmathematical. We can make it five-dimensional by adding S for size of shoe, and six-dimensional by adding C for number of children, and so on.
布莱克今年 35 岁，身高 60 英寸，体重 160 美元，拥有 2 美元。怀特身高 42 68 英寸，体重 135 英寸，拥有 10,000 美元。标签集 A、H、W、D 是一种简单的四维流形——这个术语长期以来一直让非数学界感到恐惧。我们可以通过添加鞋子的尺寸S来使其成为五维，通过添加孩子的数量C来使其成为六维，依此类推。
Moving this idea over into the field of mechanics, we can set up ordered symbols for three distance measurements and one time measurement. With this four-dimensional manifold the position of any particular object can be fixed at any particular instant. Consider a fly in a room. Let E be the east wall, N the north wall, F the floor, T the time after 12 o’clock. The units arc inches and seconds.
将这一想法转移到力学领域，我们可以为三个距离测量和一个时间测量设置有序符号。有了这个四维流形，任何特定物体的位置都可以在任何特定时刻固定。考虑房间里的一只苍蝇。设E为东墙，N为北墙，F为楼层，T为12点以后的时间。单位为英寸和秒。
E N F T
欧洲自由贸易协定
12 2 3 5
12 2 3 5
means that the fly was 12 inches from the east wall, 2 inches from the north wall, 3 inches from the floor, at 5 seconds after 12 o’clock. The next label might be 60, 100, 36, 6—which you can translate yourself. “By refining our observations to the limit of endurance, we could fit labels enough to describe the erratic flight of the fly for an hour with sufficient accuracy for all human purposes.” This hour’s history is a four-dimensional manifold by definition, and gives us a useful method of describing the order of certain happenings in the outside world.1
表示苍蝇距离东墙 12 英寸，距离北墙 2 英寸，距离地板 3 英寸，时间为 12 点后 5 秒。下一个标签可能是 60、100、36、6——您可以自己翻译。 “通过将我们的观察细化到耐力的极限，我们可以贴上足够的标签来描述苍蝇一小时内不稳定的飞行，并且足够准确地满足所有人类的目的。”根据定义，这一小时的历史是一个四维流形，它为我们提供了一种有用的方法来描述外部世界某些事件的顺序。1
It is meaningless to talk of the “the fourth dimension.” We can construct as many dimensions in manifolds of this kind as we wish. Yet no sooner did relativity become news than a lady with a piercing eye undertook to tell the good people of Pasadena—for a fee—exactly how “the fourth dimension” would enable them to recapture their virility, their dividends, their faith in God, and their straying husbands or wives. Remember that fly, and do not cringe before the fourth dimension again.
谈论“第四维度”是没有意义的。我们可以根据需要在此类流形中构造任意多个维度。然而，相对论一成为新闻，一位目光锐利的女士就开始向帕萨迪纳的好人们免费讲述“第四维度”将如何使他们重新获得他们的男子气概、他们的红利、他们对上帝的信仰，以及他们出轨的丈夫或妻子。记住那次飞翔，不要再在第四维度面前畏缩。
The relatively young science of agrobiology is an excellent example of the usefulness of mathematics to farmers, to gardeners, and to the public in general Observe the progression. First Liebig determined, by growing plants in earthenware pots, the various chemical substances essential to plant life—phosphorus, potash, nitrogen, sulphur, magnesium, and the rest. Then Mitscherlich carried on the experiments to show the specific effect of each chemical on plant yields. For a pot of oats, no nitrogen resulted in no yield; .35 grams of nitrogen gave 80 grams of dried oat plant; .7 grams of nitrogen gave 120 grams of plant; 14 grams gave 150, and 3.5 grams 160. This was the end. No matter how much more nitrogen was added to the pot, the yield could not be raised above 160 grams.
农业生物学这门相对年轻的科学是数学对农民、园丁和公众有用的一个很好的例子。观察其进展。首先，李比希通过在陶罐中种植植物，确定了植物生命所必需的各种化学物质——磷、钾、氮、硫、镁等。随后 Mitscherlich 进行了实验，以展示每种化学物质对植物产量的具体影响。对于一盆燕麦来说，不施氮就没有产量； .35克氮产生80克干燕麦植物； 0.7克氮产生120克植物； 14克为150，3.5克为160。这就是结局。无论向盆中添加多少氮，产量都无法提高到160克以上。
Now when these figures are neatly tabulated and checked by scores of experiments, mathematics enters, and a curve is plotted. Curves are similarly prepared for the effect on oats of potassium, phosphorus, and the other chemicals. Measured quantities of water are applied, and curves are prepared for that. When oats are finished, corn, wheat, roses, and other plants are grown in pots and their curves in turn are plotted. Presently a law is derived: “When we take as the unit of a growth factor that quantity of it that will produce 50 per cent of the total yield, then each cumulative unit is only half as effective as the unit that went before.” The more fertilizer you add, the greater the yield—this side of the limit—but at a diminished rate. It was once thought that plant growth went up in a straight line as fertilizer was added.
现在，当这些数字被整齐地制成表格并通过大量实验进行检查时，数学就进入了，并绘制了一条曲线。同样，我们还绘制了钾、磷和其他化学物质对燕麦的影响曲线。应用测量的水量，并为此准备曲线。当燕麦完成后，玉米、小麦、玫瑰和其他植物就会种植在盆中，并依次绘制出它们的曲线。目前推导出一条定律：“当我们以能产生总产量50%的数量作为生长因子的单位时，那么每个累积单位的效果只有前一个单位的一半。”添加的肥料越多，产量就越高（在极限的这一侧），但产量会降低。人们曾经认为，随着肥料的添加，植物的生长会直线上升。
Thus the agrobiologists discovered with the aid of mathematics a practical law of the utmost importance. They have done more. They have calculated the possible maximum yield of many plants, and are prepared to do it for any plant that grows except the fungi, which follow different rules. The maximum yield of corn, for instance, is 225 bushels per acre. This quantity of corn has actually been raised. Agrobiology is already revolutionizing the art of growing things, and the future effects, economic, political, and international, promise to be epoch-making. It employs the language of mathematics to a great extent, and indeed would be nonexistent without mathematics. Note carefully, however, that this machine does not run on air; it runs on pots of oats and corn.1
因此，农业生物学家在数学的帮助下发现了一条极其重要的实践法则。他们做得更多。他们计算了许多植物可能的最大产量，并准备对除真菌之外的任何植物进行计算，因为真菌遵循不同的规则。例如，玉米的最高产量为每英亩 225 蒲式耳。这个数量的玉米实际上已经被提高了。农业生物学已经彻底改变了植物生长的艺术，其未来的经济、政治和国际影响有望是划时代的。它在很大程度上运用了数学的语言，而且如果没有数学，它就根本不存在。但请注意，这台机器不是靠空气运行的。它以燕麦和玉米为食。1
Mathematical language is also susceptible of abuse. It is not so widespread as the abuse of ordinary language, but it is serious enough. It takes various forms. Ever since numbers were invented people have become intoxicated with their possible combinations and have gone off on magnificent ghost chases after mystical numbers. Numbers, of course, are nothing but useful symbols to fill gaps in meaning and communication. They originated in the human cortex and are unreported anywhere in nature. We have objectified them, as we have done with so many other symbols, into puissant forces in the world outside. Consider the vast amount of tosh erected around the number 7: the Seven Candlesticks, the Seven Deadly Sins, the Seven Planets. In the year that Piazzi discovered Ceres—or planet Number 8—Hegel wrote upbraiding the scientists for their neglect of philosophy. Philosophy, he said, had established seven as the only possible number of planets. Why waste time looking for more?
数学语言也容易被滥用。它不像普通语言的滥用那么普遍，但也足够严重了。它有多种形式。自从数字被发明以来，人们就沉迷于它们可能的组合，并开始了对神秘数字的宏伟幽灵追逐。当然，数字只不过是填补意义和沟通空白的有用符号。它们起源于人类皮质，在自然界中尚未有报道。正如我们对许多其他符号所做的那样，我们将它们客观化为外部世界的强大力量。想想围绕数字 7 竖起的大量垃圾：七烛台、七大罪、七大行星。在皮亚齐发现谷神星（或八号行星）的那一年，黑格尔写信谴责科学家们忽视哲学。他说，哲学已经确定七颗行星是唯一可能的行星数量。为什么要浪费时间去寻找更多呢？
Again, many men, including mathematicians, have failed to realize the limitations of the language. The technique is wonderfully useful for establishing relations and orders, but what are the things between which we desire to establish the relations? Mathematics is purely abstract, and says nothing about that. Just to whirl relations about in the head may be an amusing method of killing time, but no knowledge is gained until concrete things are hitched to the symbols. These objects must be carefully selected. A distinguished professor recently sent me a monograph in which calculus was solemnly applied to various kinds of consumers’ goods, such as potatoes and automobiles, including, if you please, “subjective wants.” Try to count anything in the real world corresponding to “subjective wants”! The result of all this fine mathematics, of course, was blab.
同样，包括数学家在内的许多人都没有意识到该语言的局限性。该技术对于建立关系和秩序非常有用，但是我们希望在哪些事物之间建立关系呢？数学纯粹是抽象的，并没有说明这一点。仅仅在头脑中旋转关系可能是一种消磨时间的有趣方法，但只有将具体事物与符号联系起来，才能获得知识。这些对象必须经过仔细选择。一位杰出的教授最近寄给我一本专着，其中微积分被郑重地应用于各种消费品，例如土豆和汽车，如果你愿意的话，还包括“主观需求”。试着数一下现实世界中与“主观需求”相对应的一切！当然，所有这些精细数学的结果都是空洞的。
Mathematics has been likened to a sausage machine. Feed it proper raw materials and turn the crank. Something useful, if not edible, comes out. Feed it nothing and turn the crank. There is much grinding of gears, but nothing comes out. Feed it scrap iron mixed with broken glass and the machine refuses to work. A good deal of what passes for pure mathematics consists in whirring the works with nothing edible inside. Meanwhile the makers of various kinds of economic index numbers are feeding the sausage machine scrap iron and broken glass. Bertrand Russell has characterized pure mathematics as “that science in which we neither know what we are talking about, nor whether what we say is true.”
数学被比作香肠机。喂入适当的原材料并转动曲柄。一些有用的东西，即使不能食用，也会出来。不给它喂食并转动曲柄。齿轮磨了很多次，但什么也没出来。如果把废铁和碎玻璃混合在一起喂给它，机器就无法工作。很多被认为是纯数学的东西都是在内部没有任何可食用的东西的情况下运转的。与此同时，各种经济指标的制造者正在向香肠机喂入废铁和碎玻璃。伯特兰·罗素将纯数学描述为“我们既不知道我们在谈论什么，也不知道我们所说的是否正确的科学”。
Always examine the data assumed. If the assumptions are without tangible validity, the mathematical theories deduced from them may scintillate with dazzling plausibilities, but they will be worthless. A dangerous abuse of mathematics appears in the practice of extrapolation—described earlier as riding a trend curve to Cloudcuckooland. Here deductions are made from facts, but there are not enough facts. Example: The earth will maintain vegetation for the next 5,000,000 years. A wild guess. No operations are available except some crude data on the rate of the earth’s cooling. Another example: The New York Metropolitan Area will have a population of 21,000,000 by 1965. This is a more careful guess, based on actual population trends prior to 1920. The fact of birth control, among others, was neglected, and it now looks as though the New York metropolitan population in 1965 would be far less than the original estimate.
始终检查假设的数据。如果这些假设没有切实的有效性，那么从中推导出来的数学理论可能会闪烁着令人眼花缭乱的合理性，但它们将毫无价值。外推法的实践中出现了对数学的危险滥用——前面描述的是沿着趋势曲线到达云杜鹃乐园。这里是根据事实推论，但事实还不够。示例：地球将在未来 5,000,000 年里维持植被。一个疯狂的猜测。除了一些关于地球冷却速度的粗略数据外，没有任何可用的操作。另一个例子：到1965年，纽约都会区的人口将达到21,000,000。这是根据1920年之前的实际人口趋势进行的更仔细的猜测。节育等事实被忽视了，现在看来尽管1965年纽约大都市的人口将远远少于最初的估计。
Be exceedingly chary of large generalizations under the caption “Science Says That Universe Is Running Down,” or “Science Says That Universe Is Blowing Up,” or “Science Says That in Ten Thousand Years the Human Race Will Have Lost Its Teeth.” Some professor is probably making an extrapolating ass of himself. Bell furnishes a list of famous extrapolations about the age of the earth.
对“科学说宇宙正在衰落”、“科学说宇宙正在爆炸”或“科学说在一万年内人类将失去牙齿”标题下的大概括要格外小心。某些教授可能是在自我推断。贝尔提供了一系列关于地球年龄的著名推断。

Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, and pick your winner! Here is another choice item of extrapolation paraphrased from a book by Stewart and Tait, physicists of fifty years ago.
女士们先生们，站起来，选出您的获胜者！这是五十年前物理学家斯图尔特和泰特所著书中的另一个外推选择项。
Matter is made up of molecules (size A) which are vortex rings composed of luminiferous ether. The ether is made up of much smaller molecules (size B), vortex rings in the subether. This is the Unseen Universe. Here the human Soul exists. It is made up of B molecules. It permeates the body like a gas. Thought is vibratory motion in the A molecules, but part of the vibration, following the law of the conservation of energy, will be absorbed by the B molecules, the Soul. Therefore the Soul has memory. When the body dies, the Soul keeps memory intact, and becomes a free agent in the subether. The physical possibility of the immortality of the Soul is thus demonstrated.
物质由分子（大小A）组成，分子是由发光以太组成的涡环。以太由更小的分子（尺寸 B）、亚以太中的涡环组成。这就是看不见的宇宙。这里存在着人类的灵魂。它是由B分子组成的。它像气体一样渗透到身体里。思想是A分子中的振动运动，但根据能量守恒定律，部分振动将被B分子（灵魂）吸收。因此灵魂有记忆。当身体死亡时，灵魂保持完整的记忆，并成为以太中的自由者。灵魂不朽的物理可能性由此得到证明。
The volume in which this charming balderdash appeared was widely read in the 1870’s and 1880’s.
出现这个迷人的胡言乱语的那本书在 1870 年代和 1880 年代被广泛阅读。
Mathematics can do no more, explain no more, than the tangible things to which its symbols are hitched permit. Beyond this limit, it goes off the deep end and has no meaning. In the language of mathematics no less than in ordinary language we must find the referent for the symbols. There is no truth in the machinery of mathematics as such, only an endless series of tautologies. Two plus 2, we say, is 4, and with glittering eye challenge the world to get around this great truth. Bartenders get around it every day, for 2 quarts of alcohol plus 2 quarts of water do not make 4 quarts of highball, but something less. A chemical change shrinks the volume of the mixture. “Two plus 2 is 4” is a statement which may be true in one context and untrue in another. Find the referent. Two what? Where? When? Upward reports a primitive tribe whose language unmasks this absolute even more effectively. The tribe has a word for “one,” a word for “two,” but no word for “four.” The word for “two” is “burla.” So when the chief intones the great truth, he says, “Burla and burla is always and forever burla-burla!”
数学所能做的事情、解释的事情，都超出了其符号所允许的有形事物的范围。超出这个限度，就脱离了深渊，没有任何意义。在数学语言中，正如在普通语言中一样，我们必须找到符号的所指对象。数学机制本身并不存在真理，只有一系列无穷无尽的同义反复。我们说，二加二等于四，并用闪闪发光的眼睛挑战世界，让他们绕过这个伟大的真理。调酒师每天都在回避这个问题，因为 2 夸脱的酒精加 2 夸脱的水并不能制成 4 夸脱的高球威士忌，而是更少的东西。化学变化使混合物的体积缩小。 “二加 2 等于 4”这种说法在某种情况下可能是正确的，但在另一种情况下可能是错误的。找到参照物。两个什么？在哪里？什么时候？ 《向上》报道了一个原始部落，他们的语言更有效地揭示了这一绝对性。该部落有一个表示“一”的词，一个表示“二”的词，但没有表示“四”的词。 “二”这个词是“burla”。因此，当酋长吟诵这个伟大真理时，他说：“Burla 和 burla 永远都是 burla-burla！”
Mathematics, as Korzybski presents it, is a language with structural similarity to the human nervous system and to the world outside. If the cortex exercises its switchboards with mathematics, the man inside can improve his grasp of the world without. Witness the case of applying mathematics to Achilles and the tortoise. But if he neglects facts from the world without, or makes false assumptions about them, he can strangle meaning as effectively with mathematics as with other languages. The process is even more dangerous, for it is widely supposed that figures speak with extrahuman authority. In its field, mathematics is good human talk, just as music is. It developed, as we have seen, to meet urgent human needs. Combined with the operational approach of modern physics, it has extended knowledge into unprecedented areas, and the extension goes steadily forward. It has been taught us badly, and we shy away from its symbols. This is our misfortune, for mathematics might be a shield and buckler against verbal confusions.
正如科日布斯基所说，数学是一种与人类神经系统和外部世界结构相似的语言。如果大脑皮层用数学来锻炼它的交换机，那么大脑皮层中的人就可以提高对外部世界的理解。看看将数学应用到阿喀琉斯和乌龟身上的例子。但如果他忽视了外部世界的事实，或者对这些事实做出了错误的假设，他就可以像其他语言一样有效地扼杀数学的意义。这个过程甚至更加危险，因为人们普遍认为人物具有超人的权威。在其领域，数学是人类的美好谈话，就像音乐一样。正如我们所见，它的发展是为了满足人类的迫切需求。结合现代物理学的操作方法，它把知识拓展到了前所未有的领域，并且拓展稳步推进。我们对它的教导很糟糕，我们回避它的象征。这是我们的不幸，因为数学可能是抵御语言混乱的盾牌和盾牌。
MUSIC AS A LANGUAGE
音乐作为一种语言
Both mathematics and music are international languages. Notes of music are signs which reach the ear through sound-waves in the atmosphere. They are produced by vibrating a vocal chord or a string of metal or sheep gut, by blowing through a wooden tube, and by other mechanisms for producing vibrations. The vibrations are arranged in two ways: (1) by varying relations of pitch or frequency of waves, either in sequence, called “melodic structure,” or simultaneously, as in a chord, called “harmonic structure”; (2) by varying the time of the release of sound-waves, including the rate of melodic sequence, and so imposing repeated orderly divisions.
数学和音乐都是国际语言。音乐的音符是通过大气中的声波到达耳朵的符号。它们是通过振动声带、金属串或羊肠、吹过木管以及其他产生振动的机制来产生的。振动以两种方式排列：（1）通过改变波的音调或频率关系，可以按顺序排列，称为“旋律结构”，也可以同时排列，如和弦，称为“和声结构”； (2)通过改变声波释放的时间，包括旋律序列的速率，等等来施加重复的有序划分。
These factors can be analyzed as mathematical relations, though it does not follow that music is a branch of mathematics. Nowhere are its structure and order more dramatically shown than when a great symphony orchestra finishes tuning its instruments, and at the tap of the conductor’s baton begins, for instance, the opening bars of Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony. What a change from chaos to order, to the pleasure of perceiving structure in sound!
这些因素可以作为数学关系来分析，尽管这并不意味着音乐是数学的一个分支。例如，当一支伟大的交响乐团完成其乐器的调音，指挥棒的敲击开始时，它的结构和秩序就得到了最戏剧性的体现，例如贝多芬第七交响曲的开场小节。从混乱到秩序，到在声音中感知结构的乐趣，这是多么大的转变啊！
When a group of people play or listen to the same composition, they are perceiving as a rule meanings similar to those of the composer. Minds meet. The variety of interpretation can change the meaning within narrow limits. The meanings are indescribable in words, but are readily perceived as order and relation. In addition, they seem to have a definite effect connected with the rhythm of pulse, breathing, and other human processes. Emotional effects are tied to the physiological. Perhaps musical structure comes close to the structure of the human nervous system.
当一群人演奏或聆听同一首作品时，他们通常会感知到与作曲家的含义相似的含义。心灵相遇。不同的解释可以在狭窄的范围内改变含义。这些含义是无法用语言描述的，但很容易被理解为顺序和关系。此外，它们似乎对脉搏、呼吸和其他人体过程的节奏有一定的影响。情绪影响与生理影响有关。也许音乐结构与人类神经系统的结构很接近。
Modern composers are probably on a surer track when they invent new mathematical relations of harmony and rhythm than when they are concerned with bombarding all music prior to 1900. If they are trying to reflect human society in 1938, no discords could be strident enough. The task is obviously beyond them. Disorderly music is a contradiction in terms and in physical fact.
现代作曲家在发明新的和声与节奏的数学关系时，可能比他们关注轰炸 1900 年之前的所有音乐时走得更稳。如果他们试图反映 1938 年的人类社会，那么任何不和谐都不够刺耳。这个任务显然超出了他们的能力范围。无序的音乐在术语和物理事实上都是矛盾的。
Chapter X
第十章
INTERPRETING THE ENVIRONMENT
解释环境
HERE is a man suddenly plunged into a personal crisis, moral, emotional, or financial. Perhaps he has been implicated in a public scandal. Or his young lady has thrown him down. Or he cannot meet the mortgage due next Friday. Things look black; he is profoundly depressed. No road of escape appears. He begins to generalize with a free use of absolute terms like “all,” “never,” “always.” “I can never succeed. I’ve always been a failure. I can never surmount this difficulty. All my life I’ve made a mess of things. I’ll never pay off that debt. No girl will ever have me. I’ll never get over this disgrace. What’s the use? Better end it all.”
这是一个男人突然陷入道德、情感或财务上的个人危机。也许他卷入了一桩公共丑闻。或者是他的小姐把他摔倒了。或者他无法偿还下周五到期的抵押贷款。事物看起来是黑色的；他非常沮丧。没有任何逃生之路。他开始自由地使用“全部”、“从不”、“总是”等绝对术语进行概括。 “我永远不可能成功。我一直都是个失败者。我永远无法克服这个困难。我一生都把事情搞得一团糟。我永远不会还清这笔债务。没有女孩会拥有我。我永远无法摆脱这种耻辱。什么用途？最好结束这一切。”
Sometimes the poor devil does. What has been happening in his mind? He has been generalizing from inadequate referents. The characteristics of the situation are not fully reported, but he has extrapolated a curve as brashly as any measurer of the age of the earth. He thinks this unfortunate “time” is all “times.” Blinded by absolutes, he cannot see other “times.” He believes this case is identical with all past and future cases in his life. He sees this woman as all women, this debt as all debt, this disgrace as an eternity of disgrace.
有时可怜的魔鬼也会这么做。他的心里到底发生了什么？他一直在根据不充分的参考资料进行概括。这种情况的特点没有得到充分报道，但他像任何地球年龄测量者一样粗率地推断出一条曲线。他认为这个不幸的“时间”就是所有的“时间”。由于被绝对所蒙蔽，他看不到其他“时代”。他认为这个案件与他一生中过去和未来的所有案件都是相同的。他认为这个女人就是所有的女人，这种债务就是所有的债务，这种耻辱就是永恒的耻辱。
If he were trained in semantics, he would say: “This is bad; this is painful, depressing, almost intolerable. But my life, my organism, is a process, always changing. Nothing stands still. What has happened can never exactly repeat itself; no two contexts are the same. There are no absolutes to bind me. Snap out of it, brother, snap out of it! Prepare for the next context—a better one for all you know.” Often he can deliberately force a change of context by shifting a job, going away for a while, developing a new interest. His task is to break away from the semantic blockage of “This is so, now and forever,” to rid his mind of an unwarrantable identification of the “this” with all things and all times.
如果他接受过语义学训练，他会说：“这很糟糕；这很糟糕。”这是痛苦的、令人沮丧的、几乎无法忍受的。但我的生命，我的有机体，是一个不断变化的过程。没有什么是静止的。已经发生的事情永远不会完全重演；没有两个上下文是相同的。没有绝对的东西可以约束我。振作起来，兄弟，振作起来！为下一个环境做好准备——据你所知，这是一个更好的环境。”通常，他可以通过换工作、离开一段时间、培养新的兴趣来故意迫使环境发生变化。他的任务是摆脱“如此，现在如此，永远如此”的语义障碍，摆脱他对“此”与所有事物和所有时间的无理认同。
The pioneers of semantics whose work we have attempted to summarize in the last four chapters have not produced a body of knowledge which can be called a science of communication, in the sense that physics, or even anthropology, is a science. Korzybski has perhaps come nearest to doing so. Each has contributed valuable material which, in combination, certainly gives us an introduction to a science, and from which a mature discipline may presently develop.
我们试图在最后四章中总结语义学先驱们的工作，但他们并没有产生可以被称为传播科学的知识体系，就像物理学甚至人类学是一门科学一样。科日布斯基也许最接近这样做了。每个人都贡献了宝贵的材料，这些材料结合起来无疑为我们介绍了一门科学，并且目前可以从中发展出一门成熟的学科。
Such a discipline demands four things: First, very extensive observation of how people use language. Second, deductions and inferences from these observations upon which (third) sane men can agree. Fourth, a continuous checking of the deductions by experiment.
这样的学科需要四件事：首先，对人们如何使用语言进行非常广泛的观察。其次，从这些观察中得出的推论和推论是（第三个）理智的人能够同意的。第四，通过实验不断检验推论。
The pioneers have assembled many facts, as we have seen. Many more are needed. They have drawn a number of deductions and agree on some of them. Korzybski has begun the fourth step by inventing the structural differential and arranging for its application to mental patients in hospitals, and to children in schools. Some of the patients have been cured, some groups of children have raised their I.Q.’s. Thus his hypothesis is being checked by controlled experiment.
正如我们所见，先驱们收集了许多事实。还需要更多。他们得出了一些推论，并就其中一些推论达成了一致。科日布斯基已经开始了第四步，他发明了结构差异，并安排将其应用于医院的精神病患者和学校的儿童。一些病人被治愈了，一些孩子的智商也提高了。因此，他的假设正在通过对照实验得到验证。
Let us list categorically those deductions upon which there appears to be agreement by two or more observers, and no announced disagreement.
让我们明确列出那些似乎得到两个或更多观察者一致同意且没有公开反对的推论。
That words are not things. (Identification of words with things, however, is widespread, and leads to untold misunderstanding and confusion.)
那句话不是东西。 （然而，将词语等同于事物的现象很普遍，并且会导致无数的误解和混乱。）
That words mean nothing in themselves; they are as much symbols as x or y.
这些话本身毫无意义；它们与 x 或 y 一样多的符号。
That meaning in words arises from context of situation.
言语中的含义源于情境的上下文。
That abstract words and terms are especially liable to spurious identification. The higher the abstraction, the greater the danger.
抽象的单词和术语特别容易被错误识别。抽象程度越高，危险就越大。
That things have meaning to us only as they have been experienced before. “Thingumbob again.”
事物只有在以前经历过的情况下才对我们有意义。 “又是辛格博布。”
That no two events are exactly similar.
没有两个事件是完全相同的。
That finding relations and orders between things gives more dependable meanings than trying to deal in absolute substances and properties. Few absolute properties have been authenticated in the world outside.
寻找事物之间的关系和秩序比试图处理绝对的物质和属性具有更可靠的意义。很少有绝对的财产在外部世界得到证实。
That mathematics is a useful language to improve knowledge and communication.
数学是增进知识和交流的有用语言。
That the human brain is a remarkable instrument and probably a satisfactory agent for clear communication.
人脑是一种非凡的工具，并且可能是清晰沟通的令人满意的代理人。
That to improve communication new words are not needed, but a better use of the words we have. (Structural improvements in ordinary language, however, should be made.)
为了改善沟通，不需要新的单词，而是更好地使用我们现有的单词。 （但是，应该对普通语言进行结构改进。）
That the scientific method and especially the operational approach are applicable to the study and improvement of communication. (No other approach has presented credentials meriting consideration.)
科学方法，特别是操作方法适用于沟通的研究和改进。 （没有其他方法提供值得考虑的凭据。）
That the formulation of concepts upon which sane men can agree, on a given date, is a prime goal of communication. (This method is already widespread in the physical sciences and is badly needed in social affairs.)
沟通的首要目标是在特定日期制定出让理智的人能够达成一致的概念。 （这种方法在物理科学中已经广泛应用，在社会事务中也急需。）
That academic philosophy and formal logic have hampered rather than advanced knowledge, and should be abandoned.
学术哲学和形式逻辑阻碍了而不是先进的知识，应该被抛弃。
That simile, metaphor, poetry, are legitimate and useful methods of communication, provided speaker and hearer are conscious that they are being employed.
只要说话者和听者都意识到它们正在被使用，明喻、隐喻、诗歌都是合法且有用的交流方法。
That the test of valid meaning is: first, survival of the individual and the species; second, enjoyment of living during the period of survival.
有效意义的检验是：首先，个体和物种的生存；第二，生存期间的生活享受。
Not everything in this list is startlingly new. Some items come close to what you and I have long regarded as common sense. The new thing is the growing precision of standards which may be applied to communication, standards upon which wide agreement may presently be possible.
并非此列表中的所有内容都是惊人的新内容。有些项目很接近你我长期以来所认为的常识。新事物是可应用于通信的标准的日益精确，目前在这些标准上可能达成广泛的一致。
A large fraction of what passes for human folly is failure of communication. The exciting promise of a science of semantics is that certain kinds of folly can, for the first time, be analyzed and modified. A standard is swinging into focus where men can at last agree that this statement makes sense and that statement makes blab. We are in sight of a technique which will let us take a political speech, a dictator’s ukase, a masterpiece of philosophy, a plan to save the world, a column by Mark Sullivan, analyze it, and tell specifically what is wrong with it, down to counting the blabs.
人类愚蠢的行为很大一部分是因为沟通失败。语义科学令人兴奋的承诺是，某些类型的愚蠢行为第一次可以被分析和修改。一个标准正在成为人们关注的焦点，人们最终可以同意这种说法是有道理的，而这种说法是胡言乱语。我们看到了一种技术，可以让我们对政治演讲、独裁者的命令、哲学杰作、拯救世界的计划、马克·沙利文的专栏进行分析，并具体指出其中的问题所在，直到数着废话。
FACTS
事实
The pioneers examined have insisted upon the priority of the fact, the event, the tangible happening. What do they mean by this? “Fact” is of course an abstract term of a very high order. When an impression hits the sensory nerves from the outside world, it is probable that factual material has caused it and demands interpretation. In this context a fact is a sign from “beyond me” to “me.” The impression can be subjected to the operational approach; often it can be measured. When two or more competent observers have agreed upon it, the factual material takes definite form. If Adam1 reports a pain in his leg, his doctor may examine the leg for injury or disease. If he finds none, neither he nor Adam1 has any other way to check this fact, if fact it be. But if Adam1 and Carpenter!, both sober and of good eyesight, see an eclipse of the moon at the same hour, there is reason to suppose that the eclipse is a fact. Below is a rough classification of factual matter:
所考察的先驱者坚持以事实、事件、切实发生的事情为优先。他们这是什么意思？ “事实”当然是一个非常高级的抽象术语。当外部世界的印象触动感觉神经时，很可能是事实材料造成的并需要解释。在这种情况下，事实是从“超越我”到“我”的标志。印象可以受到操作方法的影响；通常它是可以测量的。当两个或更多有能力的观察者达成一致意见时，事实材料就具有确定的形式。如果 Adam1 报告腿部疼痛，他的医生可能会检查腿部是否受伤或患病。如果他什么也没找到，那么他和 Adam1 都没有任何其他方法来检查这个事实（如果事实确实如此）。但是，如果亚当和卡朋特都清醒且视力良好，在同一时间看到月食，那么就有理由假设月食是事实。以下是对事实的粗略分类：
Material objects at given places and dates: This cat here; this apple; this woman named Susan Jones; this cut on my finger.
给定地点和日期的实物：这里是这只猫；这个苹果；这个女人名叫苏珊·琼斯；我的手指被割伤了。
Collections of objects at given places and dates: The people in Madison Square Garden on the night of January 6, 1937. All American locomotives in operation on April 1, 1938. (Count them.)
特定地点和日期的物品收藏：1937 年 1 月 6 日晚上麦迪逊广场花园的人们。1938 年 4 月 1 日运行的所有美国机车。（数一下。）
Happenings at given places and dates: Airship Hindenburg burns May 6, 1937, at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Armistice terminates the World War, November 11, 1918. Lincoln assassinated in a Washington theater, 1865. Napoleon evacuates Moscow, 1812. Such happenings, to be classified as facts, must be verified by competent observers at the time. Historical facts, such as Napoleon in Moscow, can be verified by records written by observers then living.
特定地点和日期发生的事件： 1937 年 5 月 6 日，兴登堡号飞艇在新泽西州莱克赫斯特燃烧。停战协议结束了世界大战，1918 年 11 月 11 日。林肯在华盛顿剧院被刺杀，1865 年。拿破仑撤离莫斯科，1812 年。这些事件若要被归类为事实，必须得到当时有能力的观察者的证实。历史事实，例如莫斯科的拿破仑，可以通过当时在世的观察者所写的记录来证实。
Processes verified scientifically: Ethyl ether boils at 34.5° C. All bodies fall with equal velocity in a vacuum. The speed of light is approximately 186,000 miles per second. A scientific fact can be rechecked at any time, and its validity can be established. A historical fact cannot be rechecked, although additional documents may be found to establish or refute it.
经过科学验证的过程：乙醚在 34.5° C 沸腾。所有物体在真空中以相同的速度下落。光速约为每秒 186,000 英里。一个科学事实可以随时重新检验，并可以确定其有效性。尽管可以找到其他文件来证实或反驳历史事实，但无法重新检查该历史事实。
A fact, then, to generalize, is an event subject to operational verification, or judged reasonably likely because of documentary evidence. The inventory of factual material does not include any high-order abstractions such as “time,” “space,” “the eternal,” “the truth,” because such things have never been observed. Most of our facts we must accept at second hand. Are the observers competent?
那么，概括而言，事实是一个需要进行操作验证的事件，或者根据文件证据判断为合理可能的事件。事实材料的清单不包括任何高阶抽象概念，例如“时间”、“空间”、“永恒”、“真理”，因为这些东西从未被观察到。我们的大部分事实都必须从二手资料中接受。观察者是否有能力？
Facts are the central exhibit of the scientific method. They are obscured by mystics, spellbinders, theologians, spiritualists, Herr Goebbels, the pain and beauty advertisers, the formal logicians, the backers of the tortoise against Achilles. Around the fact the fakers throw their verbal smoke. But ultimately the fog lifts. It must lift. We are creatures of a world of stubborn and unyielding facts. On their recognition and correct interpretation depends our existence as a species. We cannot live on lies, fantasies, and propaganda.
事实是科学方法的核心展示。它们被神秘主义者、迷惑者、神学家、唯灵论者、戈培尔先生、痛苦与美丽的广告商、形式逻辑学家、乌龟对抗阿喀琉斯的支持者所掩盖。造假者围绕这一事实抛出他们的口头烟雾。但最终迷雾消散。它必须升起。我们是一个充满顽固和不屈服事实的世界的生物。我们作为一个物种的存在取决于它们的认识和正确解释。我们不能靠谎言、幻想和宣传来生活。
CONCEPTS OF MEANING
意义的概念
The term “meaning,” like the term “fact,” is a highorder abstraction, and becomes useful only in specific contexts. There are at least five sources of meaning. It can come to us (1) from signs which are not symbols, (2) from gestures, (3) from spoken words and symbols, (4) from written words and symbols, (5) from “ideas” which seem to appear spontaneously in cur heads.
“意义”一词与“事实”一词一样，是一种高阶抽象，只有在特定的上下文中才有用。至少有五个意义来源。它可以来自（1）来自非符号的符号，（2）来自手势，（3）来自口语和符号，（4）来自书面文字和符号，（5）来自似乎出现的“想法”自发地在顽固的头脑中。
Meaning as interpretation of signs which are not symbols. You are driving a car along a road at night. The headlights illuminate pavement, shoulders, fences, trees, houses. The route is clear and in good order. No words come through, but in that you keep the speedometer at 45 miles an hour, it is evident that meaning comes through. Referents are being accurately interpreted. Suddenly, as you approach a curve, the scene goes blank, The shadows are wrong. Is that a field or a pond? Does the road swing right or left? Is that a tree you are heading for? Most motorists have experienced this devastating failure of meaning. What do you do? You do what any healthy animal does in a similar perplexity. You slow down, look sharp, wait until the world outside reassembles itself into a pattern you know. If you do not wait, you may be killed.
意义是对非符号符号的解释。晚上，您正在路上开车。车头灯照亮人行道、路肩、栅栏、树木、房屋。路线清晰，秩序良好。没有任何言语表达出来，但当你将车速表保持在每小时 45 英里时，很明显，意思就表达出来了。指称正在被准确地解释。突然，当您接近弯道时，场景一片空白，阴影错误。那是田地还是池塘？道路向右还是向左倾斜？那是一棵你要去的树吗？大多数驾车者都经历过这种毁灭性的意义缺失。你做什么工作？你会像任何健康的动物一样，陷入类似的困惑。你放慢速度，目光敏锐，等待外面的世界重新组合成你所知道的模式。如果你不等待，你可能会被杀。
This is perception of “meaning” in its primary form. A pain in some part of the body, hunger for food, an urge to sexual activity, also give elemental meanings, and are part of the survival mechanism. The higher animals receive similar signs—though they do not drive motorcars—and similar meanings. Hobie receives the message “food” from his own insides or from observing the family at table.
这是对“意义”的主要形式的感知。身体某些部位的疼痛、对食物的饥饿、对性活动的渴望，也赋予了基本的意义，并且是生存机制的一部分。高等动物也有类似的符号（尽管它们不驾驶汽车）和类似的含义。霍比从自己的内心或在餐桌上观察家人时接收到“食物”的信息。
Above the survival level, but also wordless, are various esthetic stimuli: the pleasure taken in a landscape, a well-proportioned building, the notes of music, the pattern of a dance or of games being witnessed. In these nonverbal contexts, meaning becomes sharper with experience, as the Thingumbobs are more readily recognized. Language does not enter, and semantic reform is not seriously called for.
在生存层面之上，但也是无言的，是各种审美刺激：风景中获得的愉悦、比例匀称的建筑、音乐的音符、所目睹的舞蹈或游戏的模式。在这些非语言环境中，意义随着经验而变得更加清晰，因为 Thingumbobs 更容易被识别。语言没有进入，语义改革也没有得到认真的呼吁。
Meaning as interpretation of gestures. You are out in the woodlot cutting down a tree. You hear a whistle and, looking up, see your wife beckoning. That means the pesky life insurance man has come. The beckoning is a nonverbal symbol, and carries plenty of meaning. It is the oldest human language. Hobie Baker employs it when he sits up and begs for food. Semantic improvement is not a requisite here. Per contra, communication might be improved if we made more use of gesture language Pointing, despite Emily Post, nails down referents as nothing else can.
意义作为手势的解释。你在林地里砍倒一棵树。你听到一声口哨，抬头一看，看到你的妻子在招手。这意味着讨厌的人寿保险人来了。招手是一种非语言符号，具有丰富的意义。它是最古老的人类语言。霍比·贝克（Hobie Baker）在坐起来乞讨食物时就会使用它。语义改进在这里不是必需的。相反，如果我们更多地使用手势语言，沟通可能会得到改善。 尽管艾米莉·波斯特（Emily Post）指出，指向是其他任何方法都无法比拟的。
Meaning as interpretation of spoken words. Here the higher animals leave us, although dogs and horses react to speech, even if they cannot imitate the words spoken. You talk to me; I talk to you. You tell me to watch for the red light at the railroad crossing, to stop making a fool of myself, to be sure and vote the Republican ticket, else the Constitution will be violated and the nation destroyed. The first warning is good communication leading to my survival; the last is mostly blab.
意义作为口语的解释。在这里，高等动物离开了我们，尽管狗和马对言语有反应，即使它们无法模仿所说的话。你跟我说;我跟你说话。你告诉我要注意铁路道口的红灯，不要再出洋相，一定要投票给共和党，否则宪法就会被违反，国家就会被毁灭。第一个警告是良好的沟通使我得以生存；最后一个大部分都是废话。
A similar conclusion must be drawn when Adam1 speaks to you and me as part of a crowd. If Adam1 is a policeman or a fireman with an urgent message for our immediate safety, well and good. If he is an actor in a play, well and good. If he is an orator, a lecturer, a diplomat, a counsel on public relations, a communist, or a member of the Chamber of Commerce, God help us.
当亚当1作为人群中的一员向你我讲话时，我们也必须得出类似的结论。如果 Adam1 是一名警察或消防员，为我们的即时安全传达紧急信息，那就太好了。如果他是戏剧中的演员，那就太好了。如果他是一位演说家、讲师、外交官、公共关系顾问、共产党员或商会会员，愿上帝保佑我们。
Verbal meaning is especially intense in a joke. If you get the point, it blazes. If you do not, you feel a sorry fool. So you laugh anyway. When you become baffled by the concepts of meaning, think of jokes.
笑话中的言语意义尤其强烈。如果你明白了这一点，它就会燃烧。如果你不这样做，你就会觉得自己是一个对不起的傻瓜。所以你还是笑吧。当你对意义的概念感到困惑时，想想笑话。
I have used the term “survival” several times as a touchstone for “meaning.” Let us find some referents for this concept. Here is a row of them: food and drink, houses, the birth and care of children, provision for physical and mental health, facilities for play, the Red Cross in action, the work of Dr. Victor Heiser as set forth in An American Doctor’s Odyssey, the activities of the United States Government in the Ohio flood of 1937.
我曾多次使用“生存”这个词作为“意义”的试金石。让我们为这个概念找到一些参考。以下是其中的一排：食物和饮料、房屋、儿童的出生和照顾、身心健康的规定、游戏设施、红十字会的行动、维克多·海瑟博士在《美国人》中所阐述的工作《Doctor's Odyssey》，美国政府在 1937 年俄亥俄州洪水中的活动。
Meaning as interpretation of written words and symbols. In this division the nonverbal context ranges from Pop-Eye in the comic strips to the tensor calculus. Illiterates are not affected by semantic difficulties here, but one cannot afford to be illiterate in the Power Age. One might overlook a third-rail sign, or somewhat less fatally, a one-way street sign. In mathematical symbols, semantic confusion is at a minimum, as we have seen, provided one steers clear of number magic and the pitfalls of extrapolation. In written language—notably advertising, legal opinions, state papers, and treatises on political economy—there is frequent confusion.
意义是对书面文字和符号的解释。在这个分类中，非语言上下文的范围从漫画中的大力眼到张量微积分。在这里，文盲不会受到语义困难的影响，但在电力时代，人们不能承受文盲的后果。人们可能会忽略第三条铁路标志，或者稍微不那么致命的单向街道标志。正如我们所看到的，在数学符号中，只要避开数字魔法和外推法的陷阱，语义混乱就最少。在书面语言中，尤其是广告、法律意见、国家文件和政治经济学论文中，经常会出现混乱。
Meaning as apparently spontaneous ideas within one’s head. I am writing this book. It is constantly on my mind. I wake in the night and begin to think about a chapter. Suddenly I get an idea of how to develop it or conclude it. Where did the idea come from? Did I receive a sign from without, a sound, an itch, a light-beam, that started me thinking? Or was the mechanism internal, an intricate electrical disturbance among the six quadrillion cell dynamos of my brain? Psychologists make a good case for association of ideas, how one thing leads to another. You see a fire engine. It makes you think of the night you watched a skyscraper burn at the corner of Central Park. The boards of the scaffolding flung out like fiery feathers. Which makes you think of a scarlet tanager. Which reminds you to clean out the wren house, for it is early May.
意思是一个人头脑中明显自发的想法。我正在写这本书。它一直在我的脑海里。我在夜里醒来并开始思考一章。突然我知道如何开发它或结束它。这个想法从何而来？我是否收到了来自外界的信号、声音、痒感、光束，让我开始思考？或者是内部机制，是我大脑的六千万个细胞发电机之间复杂的电干扰？心理学家为思想联想提供了很好的案例，即一件事如何导致另一件事。你看到一辆消防车。它让你想起在中央公园拐角处看到一座摩天大楼燃烧的那个夜晚。脚手架的木板像火热的羽毛一样被抛飞出去。这让你想起猩红唐纳雀。这提醒你清理鹪鹩屋，因为现在是五月初。
The wren-house idea came straight from the fire-engine sign. But what about ideas in the dark, still night? Is a sign always necessary before the cortex goes to work? I do not know; probably no one yet knows. What I do know is that internal ideas, whether spontaneous or not, are felt before they are verbalized. The feeling is often vivid. I do know that meanings of this nature are charged with dynamite—brilliant, noisy, and dangerous. If the idea can be handled as a hypothesis, pending facts to verify it, it may be useful; more, it may mark the beginning of important new knowledge. Scientists frequently report a kind of mental spontaneous combustion which fuses facts upon which they have been working into a splendid deduction. But if the idea is rushed into print without verification, as a segment of “truth,” rather than as a preliminary hypothesis, we may have a sad spectacle of false conclusions or at best pure jargon. The libraries are full of such treatises.
鹪鹩屋的想法直接来自消防车标志。但是在漆黑、寂静的夜晚里的想法又如何呢？在大脑皮层开始工作之前，信号总是必要的吗？我不知道;可能还没人知道。我所知道的是，内在的想法，无论是否自发的，在表达出来之前都会被感受到。这种感觉常常是生动的。我确实知道这种性质的意义充满了炸药——辉煌、喧闹和危险。如果这个想法可以作为一个假设来处理，等待事实来验证它，那么它可能是有用的；更重要的是，它可能标志着重要新知识的开始。科学家经常报告一种精神自燃，将他们一直在研究的事实融合成精彩的推论。但如果这个想法未经验证就匆忙付诸印刷，作为“真理”的一部分，而不是作为初步假设，我们可能会看到一个令人悲伤的景象，即错误的结论或充其量是纯粹的行话。图书馆里充满了这样的论文。
Meaning clicks, but is it a correct interpretation of the facts? The motor road at night clears as suddenly as it clouded, but what one was sure was a shadow turns out to be a new-dug ditch. Here is the argument of this book in a sentence. We need true meanings for survival, either as motorists or as a biological species. We need protection from chasms made by words as well as from dangerous ditches across the roadway. By and large, interpretation is accurate for nonverbal things; otherwise we should have perished with the saber-toothed tiger. For verbal things the case is less happy.
意思是点击，但这是对事实的正确解释吗？夜晚的汽车道路突然变得晴朗起来，但人们确信一个阴影原来是一条新挖的沟渠。这是这本书的论点一句话。无论是作为驾车者还是作为生物物种，我们都需要生存的真正意义。我们需要保护，免受言语造成的鸿沟以及道路上危险的沟渠的影响。总的来说，对于非语言事物的解释是准确的。不然我们早就和剑齿虎一起灭亡了。对于言语方面的事情，情况就不那么愉快了。
Meanings in a given situation may be true, false, absent, or combinations thereof. Absent meanings may be characterized as blab. Foreign words, new words, long words, higher mathematics, often register blab. No savvy. New experiences, like things seen by the kitten first opening its eyes, give no meanings initially. False meanings arise from misinterpretations of signs; from misunderstanding of words in which the hearer’s referents differ from those of the speaker; from emotions aroused by such terms as “red,” “atheist,” “infidel,” “capitalist,” “international banker” (a favorite spook of Henry Ford’s).
给定情况下的含义可能是正确的、错误的、不存在的或它们的组合。缺失的意义可能会被认为是废话。外来词、新词、长词、高等数学，经常出现废话。没有悟性。新的经历，比如小猫第一次睁开眼睛看到的东西，最初没有任何意义。错误的含义源于对符号的误解；由于听者的所指对象与说话者的所指对象不同而对词语产生误解；来自“红色”、“无神论者”、“异教徒”、“资本主义者”、“国际银行家”（亨利·福特最喜欢的恐怖人物）等术语所引起的情绪。
Perhaps the greatest contribution of a science of semantics would be to turn false meanings into no meanings, to hear nothing but blab blab when the high abstractions were rolling back and forth. This negative reaction would probably do more to improve communication than positive action. One’s mind would shut out bad language as the turn of a radio dial shuts out a third-rate crooner—leaving a clear and lovely silence.
也许语义科学的最大贡献就是将错误的意义变成无意义，当高度抽象的概念来回滚动时，除了废话之外什么也听不到。这种消极反应可能比积极行动更能改善沟通。一个人的大脑会排除脏话，就像收音机的转动会排除三流歌手的声音一样，留下清晰而可爱的沉默。
Communication between man and man is a two-way process. The hearer may work as hard as the speaker. Recall the Ogden and Richards triangle. The speaker receives a sign which gives him a referent to talk about. He interprets the referent in his mind and symbolizes the thought in words. For the hearer, the sound-waves (or the light-waves from the printed page) are the sign; the mind then goes to work on them to find out what they mean. The minds of speaker and hearer meet when they agree on the same referent. If the hearer finds no referent (blab) or selects a referent different from that of the speaker, their minds do not meet. Agreement is impossible. Bitter arguments are incipient.
人与人之间的沟通是一个双向的过程。听话者可能和说话者一样努力工作。回想一下奥格登和理查兹三角。说话者收到一个信号，为他提供了一个可以谈论的对象。他在心中解释所指事物，并用语言象征思想。对于听者来说，声波（或来自印刷页面的光波）是符号；然后大脑就会开始研究它们以找出它们的含义。当说话者和听话者对同一所指对象达成一致时，他们的思想就相遇了。如果听话者找不到所指对象（闲话）或选择了与说话者不同的所指对象，那么他们的思想就不会相交。达成协议是不可能的。激烈的争论才刚刚开始。
Thinking of a candle flame, A says to B, “Light is a discontinuous flux in the nonluminiferous ether.” B finds no referents for this high-sounding remark, and replies, “You don’t say so”—a tactful substitute for “I don’t know what in hell you are talking about.” Communication is zero. Again C, a theologian, says to D, a member of the Nazi party, “We must drive out the Devil.” D finds a referent immediately by identifying “Devil” with “Jew” or “Churchman,” and speeds up the persecution process. Communication is viciously in reverse.
想到蜡烛的火焰，对 B 说：“光是不发光的以太中的不连续通量。” B 找不到这句冠冕堂皇的话的指称，于是回答说：“你没有这么说”——这是“我不知道你到底在说什么”的巧妙替代。沟通为零。神学家C再次对纳粹党成员D说：“我们必须赶走魔鬼。” D 通过将“魔鬼”与“犹太人”或“教士”等同起来，立即找到了指称，并加快了迫害过程。沟通是恶性的逆转。
Let us arrange a sequence of statements and note what happens as we pass from no meaning to maximum precision.
让我们排列一系列语句，并注意当我们从无意义过渡到最大精度时会发生什么。
“Beyond the Whither is Elsinore stoobled.”
“埃尔西诺的彼岸就是被困的地方。”
Persons looking for referents here are headed for Bedlam or Bellevue.
在这里寻找参照物的人会前往贝德兰 (Bedlam) 或贝尔维尤 (Bellevue)。
“The divine is rightly so called.”
“所谓神是正确的。”
There are many quarters in which a statement like this will be listened to respectfully. X may agree that “Divine” is just the right word for the divine; Y argues that a better word might have been selected, say “Omnipotent”—“It gives more a feeling of power. The divine should be powerful, brooking no opposition.” Z is disposed to quarrel with the whole idea of divinity ana proposes to substitute the “laws of nature.” Here is something, he says, which is really divine, and begins to quote lines of poetry about God and Nature. This commands a hushed silence from the assembly, and a general nodding of heads. And so on, for hours, days. Yet the statement under semantic analysis has no more meaning than poor stoobled Elsinore. No referents can be found for it; no operations are possible to give it validity as a concept.
在很多方面，这样的声明都会受到尊重。 X可能同意“神圣”这个词对于神圣来说正是正确的； Y 认为，可能会选择一个更好的词，比如“全能”——“它给人更多力量的感觉。神应该是强大的，不容反抗的。” Z 倾向于反对整个神性观念，并提议用“自然法则”来代替。他说，这确实是神圣的，并开始引用有关上帝和自然的诗句。会议现场一片肃静，大家纷纷点头。等等，几个小时，几天。然而，语义分析下的陈述并不比可怜的笨蛋埃尔西诺更有意义。找不到它的参考对象；没有任何操作可以赋予它作为概念的有效性。
“Fascism must be destroyed.”
“法西斯主义必须被摧毁。”
You have probably often heard this statement greeted with fiery approval or fierce resentment. “Fascism” today calls up more emotional associations than “Divine.” The possibility of finding referents has perhaps improved slightly, but there is little disposition either to look for them or to agree upon them. Does the statement mean that Mussolini must be destroyed? All black shirts destroyed? All black and brown shirts? Their wearers? All dictators abolished? Including South American dictators? Including Stalin? All expressions of nationalism put down? Including Senator Borah? Or what? The maker of the statement does not clearly know what he means by it. No hearer knows clearly what is meant. In the next chapter we will prove the ambiguity of the term by citing the results of asking a number of people what it means to them.
你可能经常听到这句话受到热烈的赞同或强烈的怨恨。今天，“法西斯主义”比“神圣”更能唤起情感联想。找到参照物的可能性也许略有提高，但几乎没有人愿意去寻找它们或就它们达成一致。这个声明是否意味着墨索里尼必须被消灭？所有黑衬衫都被毁了？全是黑色和棕色衬衫？他们的佩戴者？所有独裁者都被废除了吗？包括南美独裁者？包括斯大林？所有民族主义的表达方式都被压制了吗？包括参议员博拉？或者是什么？该声明的发表者并不清楚他的意思。没有听者清楚地知道这意味着什么。在下一章中，我们将通过引用询问一些人的结果来证明该术语的歧义性。
“Consumers’ co-operatives are more efficient than private business.”
“消费者合作社比私营企业更有效率。”
This produces another turmoil of assent and dissent. But here there appears to be a real glimmer of meaning. Consumers’ co-operatives are definite organizations. Perhaps an operation can be performed comparing them with private enterprises? No, not at this point, unfortunately. The statement as it stands is meaningless. What kind of consumers’ co-operatives are more efficient? Where are they more efficient? When are they more efficient? What is meant by “efficient”? If a group of Rochdale co-operatives operating grocery stores in Milwaukee for the five years 1930–34 are compared, in respect to certified profit-and-loss statements, with a group of chain stores in Milwaukee of similar size for the same five years, and are found to make more money per dollar of turnover—then we might make a qualified statement about the superior efficiency of co-operative societies which would have some meaning. But the statement under consideration, while it may be good propaganda, is bad language. (It was taken verbatim from a 1937 news release.)
这又产生了同意和反对的另一场混乱。但这里似乎有一丝真正的意义。消费者合作社是一定的组织。或许可以和民企做一个比较？不，不幸的是，目前还没有。目前的声明毫无意义。什么样的消费合作社更有效率？他们在哪里更有效率？他们什么时候更有效率？ “高效”是什么意思？如果将 1930-34 年五年间在密尔沃基经营杂货店的一组罗奇代尔合作社与 1930-34 年在密尔沃基经营类似规模的一组连锁店进行比较，就经核证的损益表而言，并且发现每一美元的营业额可以赚更多的钱——那么我们就可以对合作社的卓越效率做出一个有保留的声明，这将具有一定的意义。但正在考虑的声明虽然可能是良好的宣传，但却是脏话。 （这是逐字摘自 1937 年新闻稿的。）
“America supports the New Deal.”
“美国支持新政。”
This statement, made in November, 1936, is capable of operational test. Count the votes for President Roosevelt. As it stands, however, it does not carry precise meaning. It needs a date. It needs referents for “America” and for “New Deal.” Probably 40,000,000 Americans who were not in favor of re-electing the President may have been in favor of one or more of the measures inaugurated by his administration. Meanwhile very few of those who voted for him were in favor of all his measures. Again, what are the referents for “New Deal”? Are they all measures enacted since March, 1933, or only the “progressive” measures? Or laws plus the execution thereof? Or execution alone? Under analysis, the statement is vague, but at a given date it probably carries enough meaning to warrant using it. President Roosevelt obviously relied on it for his legislative program in 1937. Observe how important a correct semantic interpretation may become.
这一声明于 1936 年 11 月作出，是可以进行操作检验的。计算罗斯福总统的选票。然而，就目前情况而言，它并不具有确切的含义。它需要一个日期。它需要“美国”和“新政”的指称。可能有 40,000,000 名不赞成连任总统的美国人可能赞成他的政府推出的一项或多项措施。与此同时，投票给他的人中很少有人赞成他的所有措施。再说了，“新政”指的是什么？它们都是1933年3月以来制定的措施，还是只是“进步”措施？还是法律加上执行？还是单独执行？经过分析，该声明含糊不清，但在特定日期，它可能具有足够的含义来保证使用它。罗斯福总统在 1937 年的立法计划中显然依赖于它。观察一下正确的语义解释可能变得多么重要。
“My dog has four puppies.”
“我的狗有四只小狗。”
Here at last we have a reasonably clear and concrete statement. See the dog, count the pups, establish the “my” relation. The only aspect which is not altogether clear is whether that dog gave birth to those puppies. There are ways of establishing this, but it may take a little time. Disagreement in statements of this kind is rare.
我们终于有了一个相当清晰和具体的声明。看狗，数小狗，建立“我的”关系。唯一不完全清楚的是那只狗是否生下了那些小狗。有多种方法可以实现这一点，但这可能需要一些时间。此类声明中出现分歧的情况很少见。
“Water is at its maximum density at 4° C.”
“水在 4°C 时密度最大。”
Go into the laboratory and prove it with your hands and eyes. In scientific statements of this nature, agreement is universal at a given date. The operational approach is conclusive, and meaning is found in its most precise form.
走进实验室，用你的双手和眼睛来证明它。在这种性质的科学陈述中，在特定日期达成一致是普遍的。操作方法是决定性的，并且以最精确的形式找到意义。
In the sequence above we have taken a leaf from Bridgman when he says: “Let anyone examine in operational terms any popular present-day discussion of religious or moral questions to realize the magnitude of the reformation awaiting us.” As one gains in semantic understanding he begins to hear grown men and women, presumably sane, trying to describe and settle social and political problems in words which have no more application to the grave situations at issue than the bedtime stories of children. The dream world which the eager imagination of the child builds may or may not assist the child’s development. When one hears adults solemnly employing similar fantasies in trying to cope with wars, strikes, depressions, one stands appalled at the thought of where this infantile process will lead.
在上面的序列中，我们借鉴了布里奇曼的说法：“让任何人从操作角度审视当今任何流行的宗教或道德问题讨论，以认识到等待我们的改革的规模。”当一个人在语义理解上获得进展时，他开始听到成年男女（大概是心智正常的）试图用语言来描述和解决社会和政治问题，这些语言与儿童的睡前故事一样不适用于所涉及的严重情况。孩子的热切想象力所构建的梦想世界可能有助于也可能不会有助于孩子的发展。当人们听到成年人庄严地运用类似的幻想来试图应对战争、罢工、萧条时，人们会为这种幼稚的过程将导致的结果感到震惊。

THE SEMANTIC DISCIPLINE
语义规则
WE have sketched a method and described a few foundations for what may some day become a better language structure. With these beginnings the reader may agree. He gives them verbal assent. But the semantic discipline is not to be achieved verbally. One must practice it, as in other disciplines. Training in semantics gets into the reflex arcs of the nervous system and after a while we respond, as an airplane pilot responds to a shift of wind or pressure.
我们已经勾勒出一种方法，并描述了一些基础，以便有一天可能成为更好的语言结构。读者可能会同意这些开头。他口头同意了他们。但语义纪律不是通过口头来实现的。正如在其他学科中一样，人们必须实践它。语义训练进入神经系统的反射弧，一段时间后我们就会做出反应，就像飞行员对风或压力变化的反应一样。
One learns by doing. You ask me, “Do you drive a car?” I reply, “I do.” “All right,” you say, “drive mine.” But if I reply, “No, but I know all about it,” you will not allow me to touch the wheel, if you are in your senses. Schoolchildren are learning semantic reactions with Korzybski’s structural differential. For myself, I try to learn by analyzing everything I read; by listening closely to conversations; by applying the test of operations to statements whose referents are hazy; by asking what, when, where? Semantics provides a method for reaching agreement. On how much can we get together—before the controversy begins? One’s attitude toward argument, political, economic, social, begins to change as he practices. One shifts from the belligerent “You’re wrong!” to “Exactly what do you mean by your statement?”
一个人通过实践来学习。你问我：“你会开车吗？”我回答：“我愿意。” “好吧，”你说，“开我的吧。”但如果我回答：“不，但我知道这一切”，如果你神智清醒，你就不会允许我碰方向盘。小学生正在学习科尔日布斯基结构差异的语义反应。就我自己而言，我尝试通过分析我读到的所有内容来学习；仔细聆听对话；通过将操作测试应用于所指对象模糊的语句；通过询问什么、何时、何地？语义学提供了一种达成一致的方法。在争议开始之前，我们能聚到什么程度？一个人对政治、经济、社会争论的态度随着他的实践而开始改变。一种态度从好战的“你错了！”转变为一种态度。到“你的陈述到底是什么意思？”
Says Adam1, “Man is a creature of environment and nothing else.”
亚当说：“人是环境的产物，除此之外别无其他。”
Says Adam2, “You’re wrong! Man is solely a product of heredity.”
Adam2 说：“你错了！人只是遗传的产物。”
And so hammer and tongs for two or three heated hours. Suppose that Adam2, was, as it were, in training. He does not counter with a charge of lying. He mildly asks what Adam1 means by “man,” “environment,” “nothing else,” in the context. He notes that the statement is charged with absolutes, is without meaning as it stands, and that there is nothing to accept or refute. Now, says Adam2, let us put the matter into a specific situation. Here is Adam1 living in the slums of New York, an immigrant from the plains of Poland. How much of his behavior is the result of generations of peasantry, how much the result of Rivington Street? Unless Adam1 is a hopeless bigot, he will be interested in the behavior of Adam3, and will come down from his high horse. After enough cases are examined, he will probably admit that people are influenced both by their genes and by experience. Mutual referents are thus found; agreement is reached. Then, if Adam1 and Adam2 have nothing better to do, they can commence an argument, on this foundation, as to the relative strength of environment and heredity. Referents are harder to find here. I have been in training long enough not to waste much time with relative strengths—unless the prospects for other diversions are limited. At this point in the discussion, I begin to look about for a game of tennis.
然后用锤子和钳子加热两三个小时。假设 Adam2 正在接受训练。他并没有反驳说谎的指控。他温和地问亚当1在上下文中所说的“人”、“环境”、“没有别的”是什么意思。他指出，这种说法过于绝对，没有任何意义，没有什么可以接受或反驳的。 Adam2 说，现在让我们把这个问题放到一个具体的情境中。这是住在纽约贫民窟的亚当，他是一位来自波兰平原的移民。他的行为有多少是几代农民的结果，有多少是利文顿街的结果？除非 Adam1 是一个不可救药的偏执狂，否则他会对 Adam3 的行为感兴趣，并且会放下架子。在检查了足够多的案例后，他可能会承认，人们既受到基因的影响，也受到经验的影响。这样就找到了相互的参照物；达成协议。那么，如果亚当1和亚当2没有更好的事情可做，他们就可以在此基础上开始争论环境和遗传的相对强度。在这里很难找到引用。我已经训练了足够长的时间，不会在相对优势上浪费太多时间——除非其他消遣的前景有限。讨论进行到这里，我开始寻找一场网球比赛。
Suppose we try to describe a trained semanticist a decade or more hence. I picture a good-humored young man with quick eyes and a slow tongue. You doubtless know the type and perhaps belong to it yourself. (For “young man” also read “young woman.”) Sensible and tolerant to start with, he has developed these qualities and others until he can make a clear judgment as skillfully as a trained patternmaker stamps a die. He will be aware of the growth and the structure of language. He will have some scientific knowledge about the world outside him on the three levels of macroscopic or normal, microscopic, and submicroscopic; and some knowledge of the senses, the cortex, and nerve currents, inside. He will have a clear idea of what the scientific method means, for which he must perform from time to time a few simple scientific experiments. He will know a fact from an inference as a watchdog knows his master from a chicken thief. He will know when an inference is a sober hypothesis and when it is a drunken extrapolation. He will cut down on his use of the “is” of identity. He will try never to forget that words are as much symbols as p and q and have no power in themselves. He will be extremely conscious of high-order abstractions, constantly on the search for referents, with the operational approach always in his cartridge belt.
假设我们尝试描述十年或更长时间后受过训练的语义学家。我想象一个幽默的年轻人，眼睛敏捷，舌头迟钝。毫无疑问，你知道这种类型，也许你自己就属于这种类型。 （“年轻人”也可以读作“年轻女子”。）他一开始就明智而宽容，后来逐渐发展出这些品质和其他品质，直到他能够像训练有素的制版师在模具上印章一样熟练地做出清晰的判断。他会意识到语言的发展和结构。他会对外部世界有宏观或正常、微观、亚微观三个层面的一些科学知识；以及一些关于内部感官、皮质和神经电流的知识。他会清楚地了解科学方法的含义，为此他必须时不时地进行一些简单的科学实验。他会从推论中知道一个事实，就像看门狗知道他的主人和小鸡贼一样。他会知道什么时候推论是清醒的假设，什么时候是醉酒的推断。他将减少对身份“是”的使用。他永远不会忘记，词语与 p 和 q 一样都是符号，它们本身没有力量。他将对高阶抽象具有极其敏锐的意识，不断地寻找参照物，而操作方法始终在他的墨盒带中。
He will be wary of terms with emotional tie-ups, such as “rugged individualism” and “sanctity of the home.” He will be practically impervious to most debates, arguments, and heated discussions, except for clinical purposes. He will devote little time to classical philosophy, political commentaries, polite essays, or newspaper editorials, but he will appreciate fiction, poetry, accounts of travel and exploration, and competent research work. His natural sense of humor will be pleasantly exercised by constant search for verbal spooks. His standard of evaluation will be survival and comfort: Does this event seem to contribute to improved conditions of human livelihood, or does it not? About other principles he will be diffident. He will tend, through no particular merit of his own, to become more kindly in his judgments. This is inevitable as he shifts from a one- or two-valued to a multiple-valued standard, and ceases to class “bad” girls or “lazy” boys as wholly bad or wholly lazy. The two-valued logic of absolute choice between “either” and “or” will no longer bind him. He knows that in a given situation there are normally many choices. As he begins to look outside rather than inside, rigidities and hatreds will tend to melt. His country is not going to the dogs because of what a labor leader or a President or a great banker says he is going to do, or even because of what they do. When he takes a stand, it will be based not on hifalutin principles but on factual information. It will be a pleasure to see him fight when the stand is taken.
他会对涉及情感联系的术语持谨慎态度，例如“粗暴的个人主义”和“家庭的神圣性”。除了临床目的之外，他实际上不会受到大多数辩论、争论和激烈讨论的影响。他不会花太多时间研究古典哲学、政治评论、礼貌文章或报纸社论，但他会欣赏小说、诗歌、旅行和探索的记录以及干练的研究工作。他天生的幽默感将通过不断寻找言语幽灵而得到愉快的锻炼。他的评价标准将是生存和舒适：这一事件似乎有助于改善人类生活条件，还是没有？对于其他原则，他会感到羞怯。尽管他自己没有什么特别的优点，但他的判断会变得更加仁慈。这是不可避免的，因为他从一价值或二价值标准转变为多价值标准，并且不再将“坏”女孩或“懒”男孩归为完全坏或完全懒惰。 “非此即彼”和“或”绝对选择的二值逻辑将不再束缚他。他知道在特定情况下通常有很多选择。当他开始向外看而不是向内看时，僵化和仇恨就会逐渐消失。他的国家不会因为劳工领袖、总统或伟大的银行家说他要做的事情，甚至因为他们所做的事情而陷入困境。当他表明立场时，不会基于希法鲁汀原则，而是基于事实信息。当出庭时看到他战斗将是一件很高兴的事。
The young semanticist will realize that he cannot acquire useful concepts by thinking alone. Most concepts also demand doing. It is perfectly hopeless to sit down and think about “money,” “credit,” “democracy,” “sex,” “internationalism.” The cortex turns into a merry-go-round. No, if he wants more knowledge, he must go outside his mind and observe things in action, take measurements and records, inspect the results of those who have observed and recorded. He knows that if a concept is inconstructible and unworkable in the real world, it is meaningless. And from time to time he remembers Stefansson’s account of the ostrich in The Standardization of Error. The ostrich, by popular accord and definition, is a bird which buries its head in the sand at the approach of danger. Actual or biological ostriches, however, run like hell.
年轻的语义学家会意识到，他无法仅通过思考来获得有用的概念。大多数概念也需要实践。坐下来思考“金钱”、“信用”、“民主”、“性”、“国际主义”是完全没有希望的。皮质变成了旋转木马。不，如果他想要更多的知识，他必须跳出自己的思维，观察事物的运行，进行测量和记录，检查那些观察和记录的人的结果。他知道，如果一个概念在现实世界中无法构建、行不通，那么它就毫无意义。他时不时地想起史蒂芬森在《错误的标准化》中对鸵鸟的描述。根据流行的说法和定义，鸵鸟是一种在危险临近时将头埋在沙子里的鸟。然而，真正的鸵鸟或生物鸵鸟却跑得像地狱一样。
His mind will be open for exciting discoveries in the real world—inventions, new ways of employing energy, new sorts of atoms, finer observations in medicine and physiology, but especially verifiable knowledge about political and social affairs. He will tend to be at peace with his environment, content with the understanding that this is his world and he is a part of it, and not yearning for other worlds whose locations, dates, and compositions cannot be determined.
他的思想将对现实世界中令人兴奋的发现持开放态度——发明、利用能源的新方法、新型原子、医学和生理学中更精细的观察，尤其是有关政治和社会事务的可验证知识。他倾向于与环境和平相处，满足于理解这是他的世界，他是其中的一部分，而不是向往其他位置、日期和组成无法确定的世界。
Pursuit of “fascism” As a specific illustration, let us inquire into the term “fascism” from the semantic point of view. Ever since Mussolini popularized it soon after the World War, the word has been finding its way into conversations and printed matter, until now one can hardly go out to dinner, open a newspaper, turn on the radio, without encountering it. It is constantly employed as a weighty test for affairs in Spain, for affairs in Europe, for affairs all over the world. Sinclair Lewis tells us that it can happen here. His wife, Dorothy Thompson, never tires of drawing deadly parallels between European fascism and incipient fascism in America. If you call a professional communist a fascist, he turns pale with anger. If you call yourself a fascist, as does Lawrence Dennis, friends begin to avoid you as though you had the plague.
对“法西斯主义”的追求 作为一个具体的说明，我们从语义的角度来探讨一下“法西斯主义”一词。自从墨索里尼在第一次世界大战后不久普及了这个词以来，这个词就一直在谈话和印刷品中出现，直到现在，人们几乎每次出去吃饭、打开报纸、打开收音机都会遇到它。它经常被用作西班牙事务、欧洲事务和世界各地事务的重大考验。辛克莱·刘易斯告诉我们，这可能发生在这里。他的妻子多萝西·汤普森（Dorothy Thompson）乐此不疲地将欧洲法西斯主义与美国初期的法西斯主义进行致命的比较。如果你称一个职业共产主义者为法西斯主义者，他会气得脸色苍白。如果你像劳伦斯·丹尼斯一样称自己为法西斯分子，朋友们就会开始避开你，就像你患有瘟疫一样。
In ancient Rome, fasces were carried by lictors in imperial processions and ceremonies. They were bundles of birch rods, fastened together by a red strap, from which the head of an ax projected. The fasces were symbols of authority, first used by the Roman kings, then by the consuls, then by the emperors. A victorious general, saluted as “Imperator” by his soldiers, had his fasces crowned with laurel.
在古罗马，权杖是在帝国游行和仪式上由刀锋手携带的。它们是一捆捆的桦木棒，用一条红色带子固定在一起，从带子上伸出斧头。束带是权力的象征，首先由罗马国王使用，然后由执政官使用，最后由皇帝使用。一位胜利的将军，被他的士兵们尊称为“皇帝”，他的权杖上戴着月桂树。
Mussolini picked up the word to symbolize the unity in a squad of his black-shirted followers. It was also helpful as propaganda to identify Italy in 1920 with the glories of imperial Rome. The program of the early fascists was derived in part from the nationalist movement of 1910, and from syndicalism. The fascist squadrons fought the communist squadrons up and down Italy in a series of riots and disturbances, and vanquished them. Labor unions were broken up and crushed.
墨索里尼选择这个词来象征他的黑衫追随者的团结。将 1920 年的意大利与罗马帝国的辉煌等同起来，这也有助于宣传。早期法西斯主义者的纲领部分源自 1910 年的民族主义运动和工团主义。法西斯军团在意大利各地与共产主义军团进行了一系列的骚乱和骚乱，并击败了他们。工会被瓦解和镇压。
People outside of Italy who favored labor unions, especially socialists, began to hate fascism. In due time Hitler appeared in Germany with his brand of National Socialism, but he too crushed labor unions, and so he was called a fascist. (Note the confusion caused by the appearance of Hitler’s “socialism” among the more orthodox brands.) By this time radicals had begun to label anyone they did not like as a fascist. I have been called a “social fascist” by the left press because I have ideas of my own. Meanwhile, if the test of fascism is breaking up labor unions, certain American communists should be presented with fasces crowned with laurel.
意大利以外支持工会的人们，尤其是社会主义者，开始憎恨法西斯主义。希特勒适时地带着他的国家社会主义品牌出现在德国，但他也镇压工会，因此他被称为法西斯主义者。 （请注意希特勒的“社会主义”在更正统的品牌中出现所造成的混乱。）此时，激进分子已经开始给他们不喜欢的任何人贴上法西斯分子的标签。我被左派媒体称为“社会法西斯主义者”，因为我有自己的想法。与此同时，如果法西斯主义的考验是瓦解工会，那么某些美国共产党人就应该被授予戴着桂冠的法西斯。
Well, what does “fascism” mean? Obviously the term by itself means nothing. In one context it has some meaning as a tag for Mussolini, his political party, and his activities in Italy. In another context it might be used as a tag for Hitler, his party, and his political activities in Germany. The two contexts are clearly not identical, and if they are to be used one ought to speak of the Italian and German varieties as fascism] and fascism:.
那么，“法西斯主义”是什么意思？显然，这个术语本身没有任何意义。在某种情况下，它作为墨索里尼、他的政党以及他在意大利活动的标签具有一定的意义。在另一种情况下，它可能被用作希特勒、他的政党以及他在德国政治活动的标签。这两个上下文显然不相同，如果要使用它们，应该将意大利和德国的变体称为法西斯主义]和法西斯主义：。
More important than trying to find meaning in a vague abstraction is an analysis of what people believe it means. Do they agree? Are they thinking about the same referent when they hear the term or use it? I collected nearly a hundred reactions from friends and chance acquaintances during the early summer of 1937.1 did not ask for a definition, but asked them to tell me what “fascism” meant to them, what kind of a picture came into their minds when they heard the term. Here are sample reactions:
比试图在模糊的抽象中寻找意义更重要的是分析人们认为它意味着什么。他们同意吗？当他们听到或使用这个术语时，他们是否想到的是同一个所指对象？我在 1937 年初夏收集了近百个朋友和偶然认识的人的反应。1 没有询问定义，而是请他们告诉我“法西斯主义”对他们来说意味着什么，当他们听到“法西斯主义”时，他们脑海中浮现出什么样的画面？期限。以下是反应示例：

Further comment is really unnecessary. It is safe to say that kindred abstractions, such as “democracy,” “communism,” “totalitarianism,” would show a like reaction. The persons interviewed showed a dislike of “fascism,” but there was little agreement as to what it meant. A number skipped the description level and jumped to the inference level, thus indicating that they did not know what they were disliking. Some specific referents were provided when Hitler and Mussolini were mentioned. The Italian hairdresser went back to the bundle of birch rods in imperial Rome.
进一步评论确实没有必要。可以肯定地说，类似的抽象概念，例如“民主”、“共产主义”、“极权主义”，也会表现出类似的反应。受访者表现出对“法西斯主义”的厌恶，但对其含义却没有达成一致。一些人跳过了描述层面，跳到了推理层面，这表明他们不知道自己不喜欢什么。当提到希特勒和墨索里尼时，提供了一些具体的指称。这位意大利理发师又回到了罗马帝国的那捆桦木棒。
There are at least fifteen distinguishable concepts in the answers quoted. The ideas of “dictatorship” and “repression” are in evidence but by no means uniform. It is easy to lump these answers in one’s mind because of a dangerous illusion of agreement. If one is opposed to fascism, he feels that because these answers indicate people also opposed, then all agree. Observe that the agreement, such as it is, is on the inference level, with little or no agreement on the objective level. The abstract phrases given are loose and hazy enough to fit our loose and hazy conceptions interchangeably. Notice also how readily a collection like this can be classified by abstract concepts; how neatly the pigeonholes hold answers tying fascism up with capitalism, with communism, with oppressive laws, or with lawlessness. Multiply the sample by ten million and picture if you can the aggregate mental chaos. Yet this is the word which is soberly treated as a definite thing by newspapers, authors, orators, statesmen, talkers, the world around.
引用的答案中至少有十五个可区分的概念。 “独裁”和“镇压”的观念显而易见，但绝不统一。由于存在一种危险的一致幻觉，人们很容易将这些答案混为一谈。如果一个人反对法西斯主义，他觉得因为这些答案表明人们也反对，所以所有人都同意。观察到，这种一致只是在推论层面上达成的，而在客观层面上几乎没有达成一致。给出的抽象短语足够松散和模糊，可以互换地适应我们松散和模糊的概念。还要注意像这样的集合可以很容易地通过抽象概念进行分类；这些文件夹里的答案多么整齐地把法西斯主义与资本主义、共产主义、压迫性法律或无法无天联系在一起。将样本乘以 1000 万，然后想象一下你的心理混乱情况。然而，这个词却被报纸、作家、演说家、政治家、谈话家和周围的世界清醒地视为明确的事物。
Let us now introduce a man with really exceptional mental equipment. Here is a definition by Harold Laski in a foreword to a recent book on Germany—not Italy, mind you, but Germany.
现在让我们介绍一位具有非凡智力的人。这是哈罗德·拉斯基（Harold Laski）在最近一本关于德国的书的前言中给出的定义——请注意，不是意大利，而是德国。
I suggest the conclusion that Fascism is nothing but monopoly capitalism imposing its will on the masses which it has deliberately transformed into slaves. The ownership of the instruments of production remains in private hands.
我提出这样的结论：法西斯主义只不过是垄断资本主义，将其意志强加于大众，并故意将其转化为奴隶。生产资料的所有权仍然掌握在私人手中。
A poor-white tenant farmer in Arkansas reading this statement would get almost nothing from it—a succession of blabs. The words and the phrasing are as unfamiliar to him as though Laski were talking a foreign language. A reader of the New Republic living in New York has no such blank reaction. The statement is to him apparently clear.
阿肯色州的一位贫穷白人佃农读到这份声明后几乎什么也得不到——一连串的废话。这些词语和措辞对他来说很陌生，就像拉斯基在说外语一样。居住在纽约的《新共和》的读者却没有这种茫然的反应。这句话对他来说显然很清楚。
But the student of semantics, while he sees well enough what the reader of the New Republic sees, goes further. Meaning in the form of a row of abstractions does not satisfy him. He finds three high-order terms equated and an inference applied to one or all of them: private ownership = capitalism = fascism. He is immediately suspicious of the identification of three timeless, spaceless, descriptionless entities. He never saw an “ism” imposing its will. He asks what are the referents for “private ownership,” “monopoly capitalism,” and “fascism.” He wonders what is meant by “capitalism imposing its will on the masses,” remembering that this is a stock phrase in socialist propaganda. He thinks of chain gangs, galley slaves, Negroes on plantations before the Civil War. “Ownership of the instruments of production” troubles him as another stock phrase. He recalls how Berle and Means in their Modern Corporation and Private Property show that many legal “owners” of large corporations have nothing to say about their “property.” They collect dividends, if any, and drop their proxies in the wastebasket. “Private hands” worries him more. He knows that whatever titles private persons may hold to property in Germany or Italy, the Government jolly well tells them when, where, and how much to let go of.
但是语义学的学生虽然对《新共和》的读者所看到的东西看得很清楚，但他却走得更远。一排抽象形式的意义并不能让他满意。他发现三个高阶术语是相等的，并且推论适用于其中一个或全部：私有制=资本主义=法西斯主义。他立即对这三个永恒、无空间、无描述的实体的识别产生了怀疑。他从未见过一个“主义”将其意志强加于人。他询问“私有制”、“垄断资本主义”和“法西斯主义”的指称是什么。他想知道“资本主义将其意志强加于群众”是什么意思，并记住这是社会主义宣传中的常用短语。他想到了内战前的铁链帮派、厨房奴隶和种植园里的黑人。 “生产工具的所有权”是另一个令他烦恼的俗语。他回忆起伯利和米恩斯在他们的《现代公司和私有财产》中如何表明，大公司的许多合法“所有者”对他们的“财产”无话可说。他们收取股息（如果有的话），然后将其代理人扔进废纸篓。 “私人之手”让他更担心。他知道，无论私人在德国或意大利拥有何种财产所有权，政府都会很好地告诉他们何时、何地以及放弃多少。
In brief, by the time he gets through trying to find referents for these exalted terms, his mind is about as blank as that of the Arkansas farmer. He is not disposed to argue with Mr. Laski, because the apparent meaning has faded into a series of semantic blanks. Laski is not necessarily wrong; he is saying nothing worth listening to. Knowledge cannot be spread, sensible action cannot be taken, on the basis of such talk.
简而言之，当他试图为这些崇高的术语找到指称时，他的大脑就像阿肯色州农民一样一片空白。他不愿意与拉斯基先生争论，因为表面的含义已经消失为一系列语义空白。拉斯基不一定是错的；他的观点是正确的。他没有说什么值得听的。基于这样的言论，知识无法传播，也无法采取明智的行动。
But should not one be afraid of fascism and fight against it? The student of semantics is not afraid of evil spirits and takes no steps to fight them. If he observes, or is reliably informed, of secret societies devoted to seizing by force the United States Government, he may be prepared to fight them. If he sees a citizen or an official preventing other citizens from talking about their grievances or airing their views, he may be prepared to fight. If he observes a group persecuting people called Jews or members of the Negro race, he may be prepared to fight. If the armies of Mussolini or Hitler invade his country, he is prepared to fight. But he refuses to shiver and shake at a word, and at dire warnings of what that word can do to him at some unnamed future date.
但人们不应该害怕法西斯主义并与之斗争吗？语义学的学生并不害怕邪灵，也不会采取任何措施与它们对抗。如果他观察到或得到可靠消息，有秘密社团致力于用武力夺取美国政府，他可能会准备与他们作战。如果他看到一名公民或官员阻止其他公民谈论他们的不满或表达他们的观点，他可能会准备战斗。如果他看到一个团体迫害犹太人或黑人，他可能会准备战斗。如果墨索里尼或希特勒的军队入侵他的国家，他准备战斗。但他拒绝因任何一句话而颤抖，也拒绝因这个词在未来某个不知名的日期对他造成的可怕警告而颤抖。
The analysis of “fascism” shows what the student of semantics is likely to find in many departments of human affairs. How much are educational methods in the schools and colleges affected by bad language? How about the learned body of doctrine known as “art criticism,” across whose battered corpus art critics glare angrily at one another? Can appreciation of those forms we label “art” be taught through words, or only at the lower level of direct sense impression? How far is failure of meaning responsible for those grave difficulties between men and women we call “sexual problems”? What is the semantic justification for the people termed “intellectuals”? Do they know what they are talking about? Are they wise, or just wordy? What is the semantic explanation, if any, of “mental healing”? Does the healer eliminate one set of absolutes in the patient’s mind only to install another set?
对“法西斯主义”的分析表明了语义学的学生可能会在人类事务的许多部门中发现什么。学校和大学的教育方法受到脏话的影响有多大？被称为“艺术批评”的博学学说怎么样？在其饱受摧残的语料库中，艺术批评家们愤怒地互相瞪视？对我们标记为“艺术”的那些形式的欣赏可以通过语言来教授，还是只能在较低水平的直接感官印象中教授？意义的缺失在多大程度上导致了我们称之为“性问题”的男女之间的严重困难？被称为“知识分子”的人的语义理由是什么？他们知道自己在说什么吗？他们是聪明人还是只是啰嗦？如果有的话，“心理治疗”的语义解释是什么？治疗师是否会消除病人心中的一套绝对，只是为了安装另一套绝对？
Do some certified doctors treat names of diseases rather than bodily disorders? Dr. F. G. Crookshank, contributing a monograph to The Meaning of Meaning, asserts that they do, and gives a long case history of “infantile paralysis” to prove it. Dr. Alexis Carrel in Man the Unknown is equally emphatic. He says that physicians must take into account the uniqueness of each patient, and that their chief function is to relieve the sufferings of that patient and to cure him. Many doctors still persist in pursuing abstractions. “Medicine, installed in its palaces, defends, as did the Church of the Middle Ages, the reality of Universals.” There is untold confusion cf the symbols indispensable to the creation of a science of medicine with the concrete patient who has to be treated and relieved.
一些经过认证的医生是否治疗疾病名称而不是身体疾病？ FG Crookshank 博士为《意义的意义》撰写了专着，断言它们确实如此，并给出了长期的“小儿麻痹症”病史来证明这一点。 《未知的人》中的亚历克西斯·卡雷尔博士同样强调这一点。他说，医生必须考虑到每个患者的独特性，他们的主要职责是减轻患者的痛苦并治愈他。许多医生仍然坚持追求抽象。 “就像中世纪的教会一样，在宫殿中安装的医学捍卫了普遍性的现实。”对于创建医学科学必不可少的符号与必须接受治疗和缓解的具体患者来说，存在着难以言表的混乱。
The physician’s lack of success comes from living in an imaginary world. Instead of his patients, he sees the diseases described in the treatises of medicine. . . . He does not realize sufficiently that the individual is a whole, that adaptive functions extend to all organic systems, and that anatomical divisions are artificial.
医生的失败源于生活在想象的世界中。他看到的不是他的病人，而是医学论文中描述的疾病。 。 。 。他没有充分认识到个体是一个整体，适应性功能延伸到所有有机系统，并且解剖学划分是人为的。
The separation of the body into parts for study has been necessary and helpful. But to apply these artificial divisions to the patient-as-a-whole is dangerous and costly both for patient and for physician. Thus many doctors have fallen into the same word traps as the older scientists, with their matter, space, and time as separate entities.
将身体分成几个部分进行研究是必要且有益的。但是，将这些人为的划分应用于整个患者是危险的，而且对于患者和医生来说都是昂贵的。因此，许多医生和老一辈科学家一样陷入了同样的词汇陷阱，将物质、空间和时间视为独立的实体。
How many of our fixed horrors—of blood, spiders, mice, snakes, thunderstorms, catching cold, darkness, enclosed places, tramps—are fears of words rather than of actual things, of an abstract “spider” rather than of real spiders weaving in a real world? How far can the semantic discipline dissolve these horrors, and restore to us a calm interpretation of our environment? I broke a mild case of snake horror by first studying the characteristics of snakes, then watching them at zoos, and finally allowing a friendly king snake—his name was Humphrey—to crawl up under my vest and out at my neck in the presence of a roomful of people to keep me steady. That ended that. I experienced snakes instead of worrying about Snakes with a capital S.
我们有多少固定的恐惧——血液、蜘蛛、老鼠、蛇、雷暴、感冒、黑暗、封闭的地方、流浪汉——是对文字的恐惧，而不是对实际事物的恐惧，是对抽象“蜘蛛”的恐惧，而不是对真正编织的蜘蛛的恐惧。在现实世界中？语义学科能在多大程度上消除这些恐惧，并恢复我们对环境的冷静解释？我打破了一个轻微的蛇恐怖案例，首先研究了蛇的特征，然后在动物园观察它们，最后让一条友好的王蛇——他的名字叫汉弗莱——在我面前爬到我的背心下面，从我的脖子上爬出来。满屋子的人让我保持稳定。就这样结束了。我体验过蛇，而不是担心带有大写S的蛇。
Highbrow and lowbrow. The semantic discipline throws a curious light on what constitutes intelligence. As matters stand, there is a kind of vested interest in intellectual matters claimed by some of us who are handy with our words, especially the long ones. It probably comes down from the time when plain people could neither read nor write, and the priest was both spiritual and intellectual leader. In spite of the indefatigable labor of the modern high-speed press, awe of the printed word persists. Do we word men deserve this homage and respect?
高雅和低俗。语义学科对智力的构成提供了一种好奇的视角。就目前情况而言，我们中的一些善于言辞的人声称对知识问题有一种既得利益，尤其是长篇大论。这可能是从那个时代流传下来的，当时普通人既不会读书，也不会写字，而牧师则是精神和知识的领袖。尽管现代高速印刷机付出了不懈的努力，但人们对印刷文字的敬畏依然存在。我们这个词人值得这样的敬意和尊重吗？
Robert1 is a writer and lecturer dealing with social problems. In the dark of the night, turning upon his pillow, he gets an idea. He revolves it on the triangle’s left side. It sounds good. Presently he is writing a book about it, buttressing it with such facts as prove amenable. Publishers are impressed. Even some reviewers bow low at such lofty abstractions, such obvious learning. Adam1 buys the book and finds it hard going. He puts it on top of the piano, hoping to study it at a later date. Clearly there must be diamonds under the thick rock. The important subject, the long words, deserve intensive drilling. Perhaps they do. More often the book may be left upon the piano, for Robert1 has not located many of his referents.
罗伯特1是一位处理社会问题的作家和讲师。漆黑的夜里，他翻过枕头，突然想到了一个主意。他在三角形的左侧旋转它。这听起来不错。目前他正在写一本关于这个问题的书，并用经证实的事实来支持它。出版商对此印象深刻。甚至一些评论家也对如此崇高的抽象、如此明显的学习低头。 Adam1 买了这本书，发现很难读。他把它放在钢琴上，希望以后能研究一下。显然，厚厚的岩石下面一定有钻石。重要的主题，冗长的文字，值得深入练习。也许他们会。更多时候，这本书可能会留在钢琴上，因为罗伯特没有找到他的许多参照物。
You ask, “What is fire burning?” Robert1 replies with a knowing look, “Oxidation.” You are awed into silence, although “oxidation” means no more to you than “burning.” Neither does it to him. By using a synonym with more letters, he takes his place as your intellectual superior. He is often unable to perform or describe the operations which give validity to the concept of oxidation. How often are children put in their places by such fraudulent means? How many professors instructing the young keep their positions because it is widely held that they know a subject when all they know is the symbolization connected with it? The fact that one knows the names of insects or plants does not make him a competent biologist.
你问：“什么是火在燃烧？”罗伯特一脸会意地回答道：“氧化。”你敬畏地保持沉默，尽管“氧化”对你来说并不比“燃烧”更重要。对他来说也没有。通过使用带有更多字母的同义词，他取代了你的智力优势。他常常无法执行或描述使氧化概念有效的操作。儿童通过这种欺诈手段被安置的频率有多高？有多少教授指导年轻人保持自己的立场，因为人们普遍认为他们了解一门学科，而他们所知道的只是与之相关的象征？知道昆虫或植物的名称这一事实并不能使他成为一名称职的生物学家。
Cincinnatus1 grows corn and hogs in Iowa. He went to work when he was fourteen. He knows about George Washington and the cherry tree, and about Lincoln freeing the slaves. He once read Uncle Tom’s Cabin and now reads the Farmer’s Own Journal, the bulletins of the Department of Agriculture, and the Saturday Evening Post. He was mighty glad to receive his AAA checks, for they saved his farm, but he complains of “long-haired professors” at Washington.
Cincinnatus1 在爱荷华州种植玉米和生猪。他十四岁时就出去工作了。他了解乔治·华盛顿和樱桃树，也了解林肯解放奴隶。他曾经读过《汤姆叔叔的小屋》，现在读《农民自己的杂志》、农业部公报和《星期六晚邮报》。他非常高兴收到 AAA 支票，因为它们拯救了他的农场，但他抱怨华盛顿的“长发教授”。
Robert1 works with words, Cincinnatus1 with his hands. The intellectual deals in abstractions and generalizations, the plain man with the soil, trees, cement, tools. A recent school examination manual reads: “There is nothing in which stupid persons cut a poorer figure than in grappling with the abstract. . . . Their thinking clings tenaciously to the concrete. . . . It is the very essence of the higher thought processes to be conceptual and abstract.” Thank whatever gods may be for that tenacious clinging! Cincinnatus1 has a store of lofty generalizations of his own, mostly theological, but he is not interested in ideas, or where he fits into the scheme of things—until something like the depression or the drought hits him hard. He is much closer to his referents than is Robert1. His meanings are clear where Robert’s are often vague. He handles more Thingumbobs. The plain man by reason of richer firsthand experience may be a wiser human being than the intellectual, and has thus a genuine grievance against those who work sorceries with words.
罗伯特1用文字工作，辛辛那图斯1用双手工作。知识分子处理抽象和概括，普通人处理土壤、树木、水泥和工具。最近的一本学校考试手册写道：“愚蠢的人在处理抽象问题时表现得最糟糕。 。 。 。他们的思想顽强地坚持具体。 。 。 。概念性和抽象性是高级思维过程的本质。”感谢上帝的顽强坚持！辛辛纳图斯1有自己的崇高概括，大部分是神学的，但他对思想或他融入事物计划的地方不感兴趣——直到大萧条或干旱等事情对他造成了沉重打击。他比罗伯特更接近他的参照物。他的意思很明确，而罗伯特的意思常常很模糊。他处理更多的 Thingumbobs。普通人由于拥有更丰富的第一手经验，可能比知识分子更聪明，因此对那些用语言施行巫术的人怀有真正的不满。
The difficulty is not that intellectuals deal in words and theory, but that most of them do only half a job. Too frequently they are off chasing ghosts with Plato, Nietzsche, or Spengler. The plain man will not be saved by half-truths, but neither will he be saved by looking down his nose at his manure-spreader. A semantic discipline may provide intellectuals with opportunity to do a real job and assume a leadership which they often do not merit now.
困难不在于知识分子搞文字和理论，而在于他们大多数只做了一半的工作。他们经常与柏拉图、尼采或斯宾格勒一起追鬼。普通人不会因为半真半假的事实而得救，但也不会因低头看撒肥机而得救。语义学科可以为知识分子提供从事真正工作并担任领导职务的机会，而他们现在通常不值得这样做。
This brings us to a consideration of that worthy human being known as a “liberal.” Referent? Say many readers of the New York Nation. Such people are actuated by love of fair play—a complex balance between intellectual judgments and generous feelings, in proportions varying with each individual. In a given social situation—Spain, Cuba, the Herndon case—they whip from their pockets, as it were, a foot rule of principles concerning “democracy,” “justice,” “liberty,” “free speech,” “the rights of minorities,” with which they proceed to measure the event, as Mr. Justice Roberts measures an Act of Congress by placing it alongside the Constitution. If the situation does not fit the foot rule, the moral indignation of the liberal knows no bounds.
这让我们考虑到被称为“自由主义者”的有价值的人。指涉？许多《纽约国家报》的读者如是说。这些人受到对公平竞争的热爱所驱动——这是智力判断与慷慨情感之间的复杂平衡，其比例因人而异。在特定的社会情境中——西班牙、古巴、赫恩登案——他们从口袋里掏出一套关于“民主”、“正义”、“自由”、“言论自由”、“权利”的原则。正如罗伯茨法官通过将国会法案与宪法放在一起来衡量国会法案一样，他们以此来衡量这一事件。如果情况不符合脚规则，自由主义者的道德义愤将是无止境的。
I ask in all seriousness, is this enough to form an intelligent judgment? As the whats, whens, wheres, of the modern world grow more complex, expert knowledge is more necessary than moral judgments. The liberals have recently got themselves into some pretty bad messes in trying to settle the affairs of Puerto Rico, the doctrinal purity of Mr. Trotsky, and certain labor troubles in cooperative and consumers’ organizations. Even legal procedure is getting ahead of them. Compare the efficiency of the new arbitration machinery for settling cases out of court with the aid of technical experts. When a manufacturer sues a jobber in the textile business, and both parties agree to arbitrate, an expert in the textile industry hears the case and makes the award.
我严肃地问，这足以形成明智的判断吗？随着现代世界的事物、时间、地点变得越来越复杂，专业知识比道德判断更加必要。自由派最近在试图解决波多黎各事务、托洛茨基先生的教义纯洁性以及合作社和消费者组织中的某些劳工问题时陷入了一些相当糟糕的混乱。甚至法律程序也领先于他们。比较新仲裁机制在技术专家的帮助下庭外解决案件的效率。当制造商起诉纺织行业的批发商，双方同意仲裁时，由纺织行业的专家审理案件并做出裁决。
The liberal type is too valuable to waste time befuddling itself with foot rules. I prefer to see it, as it sometimes does, modernize its approach to social problems, listen more to experts, reserve judgment, get full of referents rather than of principles and moral indignation. Intelligent individuals generally should stop feeling obliged to have “sound” opinions on every issue. It is humanly impossible.
自由派太有价值了，不能浪费时间去迷惑脚部规则。我更愿意看到它，就像它有时所做的那样，使其解决社会问题的方法现代化，更多地听取专家的意见，保留判断力，充满参考而不是原则和道德义愤。聪明的人通常应该不再觉得有必要对每个问题提出“合理”的意见。这对人类来说是不可能的。
The student of semantics will tend to reverse the usual relationships between speaker and listener. If he is the listener, it is the duty of the speaker to use language which he can understand. This is a cardinal principle of good communication. If the speaker is unable to use words which connect with the listener’s experience, better keep quiet, or talk about the weather. It is the speaker’s task to study his audience, for an audience should not be expected to endure unintelligible noises.
语义学的学生往往会扭转说话者和听者之间通常的关系。如果他是听者，那么说话者就有责任使用他能理解的语言。这是良好沟通的基本原则。如果说话者无法使用与听者的经历相关的词语，最好保持安静，或者谈论天气。研究听众是演讲者的任务，因为听众不应该忍受难以理解的噪音。
When the speaker is a scientist or a technician, versed in the jargon of his trade, and when the listener wants to learn about earthquakes or bacteria or the technique of marginal trading in Wall Street, then speaker and listener must work hard together, finding common referents. The former keeps his technical terms at a minimum, the latter locates referents as rapidly as possible and adopts the proper technical terms for them. With patience and a little understanding, the communication gulf can presently be bridged.
当说话者是一名科学家或技术人员，精通其行业术语时，当听者想了解地震或细菌或华尔街的边际交易技术时，说话者和听者必须共同努力，找到共同点。所指对象。前者将技术术语保持在最低限度，后者尽可能快地找到所指对象并为其采用适当的技术术语。只要有耐心和一点点理解，沟通鸿沟很快就能被弥合。
A man is not a fool because he does not understand your technical language, any more than an American is a fool because he does not understand Persian. In a mixed audience of both specialists and laymen, the speaker must decide, of course, to which group he shall primarily address himself. There is no fixed principle involved, only a general admonition to talk to the people one is talking to, rather than to oneself. There still remain a few wilderness areas on the continent where soliloquies are in order.
一个人不会因为不懂你的技术语言而成为傻瓜，就像美国人不会因为不懂波斯语而成为傻瓜一样。当然，在由专家和外行组成的混合听众中，演讲者必须决定他主要向哪个群体讲话。没有固定的原则，只是一个一般性的警告，要与交谈的人交谈，而不是与自己交谈。大陆上仍然存在一些荒野地区，那里有独白。
“Unfamiliar terms,” says Huse, “are understood by translation into the familiar; abstractions by translation into concrete terms. . . . We have no guide except our own experience.” What a talisman for authors! Wc should try to write prose which connects with the maximum number of Thingumbobs in the reader’s experience, and so carries over a maximum of meaning. An obvious corollary is that good writing for grown-ups may be bad writing for children, and good writing for farmers may be bad writing for factory workers. The test of excellence shifts from rhetoric to the background of the listener.
胡斯说：“不熟悉的术语可以通过翻译成熟悉的术语来理解；通过将抽象的内容翻译成具体的术语。 。 。 。除了我们自己的经验之外，我们没有任何指导。”对于作家来说这是多么大的护身符啊！我们应该尝试写出与读者体验中最大数量的Thingumbobs相关的散文，从而承载最大的意义。一个明显的推论是，对成年人来说好作品对孩子来说可能是坏作品，对农民来说好作品对工厂工人来说可能是坏作品。对卓越的考验从修辞转向听众的背景。
Side glance at the pedagogues. Teaching children is too often a one-way process. Many teachers shower the pupil with symbols, but because of limited Thingumbobs, the pupil hears little save blab. If he is to pass examinations and not suffer the torture of falling behind in his classes, the pupil may be literally forced into psittacism: learning like a parrot, understanding nothing. No one has leaned over him and helped hold the bowstring where symbol and referent meet. When you teach your boy to drive an automobile, handling clutch, brake, and wheel, what an eager student he suddenly becomes! Progressive schools seem to be on the right track when they seek to tie words to things, but frequently their methods are sentimental and artificial. They erect models of a phoney life for children to touch and handle. Also progressive schools sometimes fill youngsters with principles and political opinions. Even if the opinions appear admirable, they are no part of good educational method. Children should be taught to seek facts and delay conelusions if they are going to learn to think.
侧目看向老师们。教育孩子往往是一种单向的过程。许多老师向学生展示大量的符号，但由于 Thingumbobs 有限，学生几乎听不到任何废话。如果他想通过考试并且不遭受成绩落后的折磨，那么学生可能会被迫陷入唯心主义：像鹦鹉学舌一样学习，一无所知。没有人俯身在他身上帮助握住符号和指示物交汇处的弓弦。当你教你的孩子驾驶汽车、操纵离合器、制动器和车轮时，他突然变得多么热切的学生啊！当进步派学校试图将文字与事物联系起来时，他们似乎走在正确的道路上，但他们的方法往往是感性的和做作的。他们建立了虚假生活的模型，供孩子们触摸和操作。进步的学校有时也会向年轻人灌输原则和政治观点。即使这些观点看起来令人钦佩，它们也不是好的教育方法的一部分。如果孩子要学会思考，就应该教导他们寻求事实并延迟结论。
The “pupil,” observes Henshaw Ward, is an abstraction who can absorb all knowledge, is on fire with zeal, amenable to all improvement. The “pupil” can be trained to all perfections by “education.” But Tommy and Sally are human beings with a surprising power to resent the intrusion of book learning. We should realize that such a Gibraltarlike defense probably has a biological reason behind it. In America we have a faith that all our problems will be resolved by education. We refuse to look at Tommy and Sally sprawled glumly in their seats; we concentrate on education up somewhere in the clouds. “The present orgies of reason at Teachers College will probably seem to the educators of 1960 on a par with the belief of Luther that a bodily Satan came through his window.” Two words now dominate the pedagogues, according to Ward, “constructive” and “creative.” To say that a method of teaching is “not constructive” is to utter a curse, while to call it “creative” is to bless it. Meanwhile the going language of educators as expressed in their learned papers reflects “the most repellent style ever developed by insensitive minds.” Ward is perhaps unduly hard on the pedagogues, but I confess that I fall into a swoon whenever I try to read their output. Much educational theory is apparently up a blind alley at the present time. Perhaps an understanding of semantics might fetch it out upon the main road.
汉肖·沃德 (Henshaw Ward) 认为，“学生”是一个抽象的概念，可以吸收所有知识，充满热情，愿意接受一切改进。通过“教育”可以将“学生”训练至完美。但汤米和莎莉是人类，他们对书本学习的侵扰有着令人惊讶的力量。我们应该认识到，这种类似直布罗陀的防御背后可能有其生物学原因。在美国，我们相信我们所有的问题都将通过教育解决。我们拒绝看汤米和莎莉闷闷不乐地坐在座位上。我们专注于云端某个地方的教育。 “对于 1960 年的教育工作者来说，师范学院目前的理性狂欢可能与路德的信仰不相上下，即一个肉体的撒旦从他的窗户进来了。”沃德表示，现在有两个词在教育者中占主导地位：“建设性”和“创造性”。说一种教学方法“没有建设性”就是咒骂，而说它“有创意”就是祝福它。与此同时，教育工作者在学术论文中所表达的现行语言反映了“麻木不仁的头脑所发展出的最令人厌恶的风格”。沃德也许对教育者过于严厉，但我承认，每当我试图阅读他们的作品时，我就会陷入昏厥。目前，许多教育理论显然已经走进了死胡同。也许对语义的理解可以把它带上主要道路。
The semantics of sex. In the department of sexual behavior, as in other departments, it is difficult to draw a line between language habits and the folkways that accompany them. We can be reasonably sure that language influences folkways at the growing tip, the point where customs shift and change. Sometimes words apply a brake to change. A public man may orate about the sanctity of the home and urge that divorce be made harder when he knows that his own son is even then consulting with a lawyer to frame evidence for a collusive divorce. This does not necessarily indicate hypocrisy. He may be sincerely defending a principle to which his son’s dilemma is a regrettable exception. It is like paying relief money while denouncing the dole.
性的语义。在性行为部门，就像在其他部门一样，很难在语言习惯和伴随语言习惯的民俗习惯之间划清界限。我们可以相当肯定，语言会在风俗习惯转变和变化的尖端影响民俗。有时言语会阻碍改变。一个公众人物可能会大肆宣扬家庭的神圣性，并敦促加大离婚力度，因为他知道自己的儿子甚至正在与律师协商，为串通离婚提供证据。这并不一定表明虚伪。他可能真诚地捍卫一项原则，但他儿子的困境是一个令人遗憾的例外。这就像在谴责救济金的同时支付救济金。
Reformers try to change institutions largely by means of words. Years ago people began to talk about the emancipation of “woman,” but many talkers continued to treat their wives like dummies. Arguments for the “equality of the sexes” fell into a swamp of false identification: woman = man. This is an overswing of the pendulum from the principle of feminine inferiority. Both principles are meaningless in the light of operations. A woman is not a man and is not inferior to a man, but is an organism with certain different characteristics.
改革者试图主要通过言语来改变制度。多年前，人们开始谈论“女性”的解放，但许多谈论者仍然把自己的妻子当作傻瓜。关于“性别平等”的争论陷入了错误认同的沼泽：女人=男人。这是从女性自卑原则出发的钟摆过度摆动。从操作的角度来看，这两个原则都毫无意义。女人不是男人，也不逊色于男人，而是一个具有某些不同特征的有机体。
For centuries the concepts associated with the words “masculine” and “feminine” hindered the education of both sexes. A boy in his efforts to live up to the abstraction “masculine” would try to be virile, dominating, dissipated, chivalrous, overtouchy about his honor, convinced of his intellectual superiority, and so on. A girl would try to be submissive, abnormally modest, given to fainting spells, coy, full of nonsensical notions about clinging vines, convinced that her poor silly head was incapable of adding up a column of figures, and so on. This process of monster-making threw grave difficulties in the path of John and Mary when they fell in love. Neither could know much about the real characteristics of the other, because of the artificial concepts with which the heads of both were stuffed. When they were silent they might become real youth and maiden; when they opened their mouths they often could not find each other for the bales of straw scarecrows between them.
几个世纪以来，与“男性”和“女性”相关的概念阻碍了两性的教育。一个男孩在努力实现“男性气概”这个抽象概念的过程中，会试图表现得阳刚、专横、放荡、侠义、对自己的荣誉过于敏感、坚信自己的智力优势等等。一个女孩会试图表现得顺从、异常谦虚、容易晕倒、腼腆、对攀附的藤蔓充满荒谬的想法、相信她那可怜的愚蠢的头脑无法算出一列数字，等等。这种怪物制造的过程给约翰和玛丽的恋爱之路带来了严重的困难。两人都无法了解对方的真实特征，因为两人的头脑中都塞满了人为的概念。当她们沉默的时候，她们可能会成为真正的青年和少女；当他们张开嘴时，常常因为中间夹着成捆的稻草人而找不到对方。
Into this extreme differentiation of the sexes, the words about “equality” swept like a fresh wind. Many men gave up with a sigh of relief the attitude of protecting women. Many girls and women struggled against biological limitations to surpass their brothers in sports, and their husbands in money-making. The pendulum is still swaying between the artificially contrasted roles of the sexes and the artificially identified roles that succeeded them. If “equality” had not befuddled us, we might have analyzed the real differences and developed them to enrich the lives of both men and women.
在这种极端的性别分化中，“平等”的字眼如一阵清风吹过。很多男人松了口气，放弃了保护女性的态度。许多女孩和妇女努力克服生理限制，在体育方面超越她们的兄弟，在赚钱方面超越她们的丈夫。钟摆仍然在人为对比的性别角色和人为确定的继任性别角色之间摇摆。如果“平等”没有让我们感到困惑，我们可能会分析真正的差异并发展它们以丰富男性和女性的生活。
What can we know? If the semantic analysis is accepted, one may legitimately inquire, What can we know? Granted the maps we now carry around are distorted, where shall we find better ones? If Adam1’s map of the Spanish situation today is dotted with nonexistent “fascisms,” “communisms,” “anti-Gods,” “anarchisms,” what can be done to replace it?
我们能知道什么？如果语义分析被接受，人们就可以合法地询问，我们能知道什么？假设我们现在随身携带的地图都是扭曲的，我们到哪里才能找到更好的地图呢？如果亚当描绘的西班牙当今局势地图上点缀着不存在的“法西斯主义”、“共产主义”、“反神”、“无政府主义”，那么可以采取什么措施来取代它呢？
It is one thing to create semantic defenses against an erroneous picture; it is another thing to draw a better picture. After all, one feels impelled to discuss the Spanish situation, to have ideas about it and express them, to form judgments, to support one side or the other, to refer the problem to public policy in America, to vote and to act in respect to Spain—or Mexico, or China, or Youngstown in the midst of a steel strike. One is inclined to say, “My map may be wrong, but it is the only map I have, and so better than none.”
创建针对错误图片的语义防御是一回事；而创建语义防御是一回事。画出更好的图画是另一回事。毕竟，人们感到有必要讨论西班牙的局势，有关于它的想法并表达它们，形成判断，支持一方或另一方，将问题提交给美国的公共政策，投票并采取尊重的行动去西班牙——或者墨西哥，或者中国，或者正在进行钢铁罢工的扬斯敦。人们倾向于说：“我的地图可能是错误的，但它是我唯一拥有的地图，所以总比没有好。”
For myself, I would rather make my way with pocket compass than with a map I knew to be inaccurate. If the Spanish situation furnishes no dependable facts, I should prefer to keep my mouth shut. This is hard for people with active brains, but the semantic discipline demands it. When one does not know what he is talking about, he had best keep quiet. If there is no “constructive” action in sight, it is unfortunate, to be sure, but better to accept it than to go drawing pictures of terra incognita in the zeal for being “constructive.”
就我自己而言，我宁愿使用袖珍指南针，也不愿使用我知道不准确的地图。如果西班牙的情况没有提供可靠的事实，我宁愿闭嘴。这对于大脑活跃的人来说很难，但语义学科要求这样做。当一个人不知道他在说什么时，他最好保持安静。如果看不到任何“建设性”行动，固然是不幸的，但接受它比热衷于“建设性”去描绘未知领域要好。
No completely accurate picture of any situation involving large numbers of people in action, especially violent action, can be formed by one individual. The characteristics are too complex. But no completely accurate map was ever drawn by a topographer. Maps good enough to chart a course can be drawn when enough facts are gathered, and that is as much as laymen can ask for in social affairs. It is ridiculous, of course, to hold that no judgment can be made, no action taken, until we have personally acquainted ourselves with all the relevant facts of every social situation which confronts us. One must find competent people whose observations can be trusted. For foreign affairs, journalists like John Gunther and Raymond Swing come to mind. They report what they see, not what they would like to see. One must do a certain amount of estimating as to where the balance lies.
一个人无法完全准确地描述任何涉及大量人员行动的情况，尤其是暴力行动。特征太复杂了。但地形学家从未绘制过完全准确的地图。当收集到足够多的事实时，就可以绘制出足以绘制路线的地图，而这正是外行在社会事务中所能要求的。当然，如果我们没有亲自了解我们所面临的每种社会情况的所有相关事实，就不能做出任何判断，也不能采取任何行动，这是荒谬的。必须找到有能力、其观察结果可信的人。谈到外交事务，人们会想到约翰·冈瑟（John Gunther）和雷蒙德·斯温（Raymond Swing）等记者。他们报告他们所看到的，而不是他们想看到的。人们必须对平衡点进行一定程度的估计。
What the semantic discipline does is to blow ghosts out of the picture and create a new picture as close to reality as one can get. One is no longer dogmatic, emotional, bursting with the rights and wrongs of it, but humble, careful, aware of the very considerable number of things he does not know. His new map may be wrong; his judgment may err. But the probability of better judgments is greatly improved, for he is now swayed more by happenings in the outside world than by reverberations in his skull.
语义学科的作用就是把幽灵从画面中吹走，创造出一幅尽可能接近现实的新画面。一个人不再教条主义、情绪化、充满是非，而是谦虚、谨慎、意识到相当多的他不知道的事情。他的新地图可能是错误的；他的判断可能会出错。但做出更好判断的可能性大大提高了，因为他现在更多地受到外部世界发生的事情的影响，而不是头骨中的回响。

PROMENADE WITH THE PHILOSOPHERS
与哲学家一起漫步
IT is reported that a brilliant Englishwoman, Lady Welby, once offered a prize of £1,000 to any philosopher submitting documentary evidence that he (1) knows what he means, (2) knows what anyone else means, (3) knows what anything means, (4) means what everyone else means, (5) can express what he means. . . . Philosophers, like artists, are notoriously an impecunious brotherhood, but at last accounts the prize had not been claimed.
据报道，一位才华横溢的英国女士韦尔比女士曾向任何提交书面证据的哲学家提供 1,000 英镑的奖金，证明他（1）知道他的意思，（2）知道其他人的意思，（3）知道任何东西的意思，（4）能表达别人的意思，（5）能表达他的意思。 。 。 。哲学家和艺术家一样，都是出了名的贫穷的兄弟会，但最后的报道称，该奖项尚未有人领取。
I have a grievance against philosophers which has perhaps unduly embittered these pages. Their works have caused me many hours of conscientious toil in years past, and I resent both the conscientiousness and the wasted hours. In this chapter I propose to move the warfare from the skirmish line to pitched battle. But I owe the philosophers an honorable salute before the foils are crossed. Their sincere desire to advance knowledge cannot be questioned. Aristotle was obviously afire with this aim. Many have sacrificed honors, preferment, financial competence, home, and health in the quest. Their intellectual capacity cannot be questioned, for among their numbers are listed the mental giants of the ages. Most of them have been distinguished for toleration, fairness, and human decency, except when disputing technical points with their brethren. Strictly speaking, I have no quarrel with Socrates1 or Socrates2—rather with the philosophic method. I like to agree and get on with the matter in hand. The scientific method encourages this, while in philosophy one school after another arises on the ashes of the last, to be consumed in its turn.
我对哲学家怀有一种不满，这也许让这些书页变得过分痛苦。他们的工作在过去的几年里让我付出了很多个小时的认真劳动，我既讨厌这种认真，也讨厌浪费时间。在本章中，我建议将战争从冲突线转移到激战。但在这一切之前，我要向哲学家们致以崇高的敬意。他们对增进知识的真诚渴望是不容置疑的。亚里士多德显然对这个目标充满热情。许多人在追求的过程中牺牲了荣誉、晋升、经济能力、家庭和健康。他们的智力是不容置疑的，因为他们当中不乏历代精神巨人。他们中的大多数人都因宽容、公平和人类正派而闻名，除非与他们的弟兄争论技术问题。严格来说，我对苏格拉底1或苏格拉底2并无异议，而是对哲学方法有异议。我喜欢同意并继续处理手头的事情。科学方法鼓励这一点，而在哲学中，一个又一个学派在前一个学派的灰烬上诞生，又依次被消灭。
William James was once asked to define philosophy and he replied, “Just words, words, words!” The philosopher is aware of the potency of his mind. He goes to it for knowledge. He believes that if he can only think energetically enough, the road will be opened. His processes are thus from reference to symbol and back to reference again, on the left side of the Ogden and Richards triangle: word, thought, word. Little of importance has yet been discovered by this method. To advance knowledge on which sane men can agree, the process must be from referent to reference to symbol, constantly checking with the world outside. To say that philosophers avoid facts is not true. But they are not governed by the facts; they are not humble before the facts; facts are not central in their concepts, but come in on tiptoe through the side door. As I see it, there are three main counts against the philosophic method.
威廉·詹姆斯曾被问及如何定义哲学，他回答说：“只是文字，文字，文字！”哲学家意识到他的思想的力量。他去那里寻求知识。他相信，只要他能够足够积极地思考，道路就会被打开。因此，他的过程是从参考到符号，然后再次回到参考，在奥格登和理查兹三角形的左侧：文字，思想，文字。这种方法还没有发现什么重要的东西。为了推进理智的人能够达成一致的知识，这个过程必须是从指称到指称再到符号，不断地与外部世界进行核对。说哲学家回避事实是不正确的。但它们不受事实的支配；他们在事实面前不谦虚；事实并不是他们概念的核心，而是从侧门蹑手蹑脚地进来的。在我看来，反对哲学方法的主要罪名有三点。
First, the waste of time on unanswerable or meaningless questions—“being,” “becoming,” “the one,” “the superman,” the nice distinctions between “Humanism,” “Realism,” and “Materialism.”
首先，把时间浪费在无法回答或毫无意义的问题上——“存在”、“成为”、“一”、“超人”、“人文主义”、“现实主义”和“唯物主义”之间的微妙区别。
Second, the application of philosophical deductions to the real world, with the result of distorting knowledge of that world. Trying to make the world behave as the words behave.
其次，将哲学推论应用于现实世界，结果扭曲了对现实世界的认识。试图让世界像言语那样运转。
Third, arousing public opinion—usually unintentionally—to violent action when the facts warrant no such action. Witness Nietzsche as used by the Germans in 1914, and Spengler as used by the Nazis today.
第三，在事实不值得采取暴力行动的情况下，引起公众舆论（通常是无意的）采取暴力行动。看看 1914 年德国人使用的尼采，以及今天纳粹使用的斯宾格勒。
The ancients. The Greek philosophers sought knowledge primarily with their heads and disdained to use their hands. Aristotle thought there were eight legs on a fly and wrote it down. For centuries scholars were content to quote his authority. Apparently not one of them was curious enough to impale a fly and count its six legs. Aristotle may have erred, which is human; the significant point is the behavior of the philosophers who followed him. By watching stones and leaves fall to the ground, Aristotle arrived at the hypothesis that heavy bodies fall faster than light bodies. This conclusion he then extrapolated into absolute properties of “heaviness” and “lightness,” which were supposed to govern the descent of all physical objects on a sliding scale of speed in proportion to weight. Not until Galileo performed an operation two thousand years later were these remarkable “principles” dethroned.
古人。希腊哲学家主要用头脑寻求知识，不屑于用手。亚里士多德认为苍蝇有八条腿，并将其写下来。几个世纪以来，学者们乐于引用他的权威。显然，他们中没有一个人有足够的好奇心去刺穿一只苍蝇并数出它的六条腿。亚里士多德可能犯了错误，这是人之常情；重要的一点是追随他的哲学家的行为。通过观察石头和树叶落到地上，亚里士多德得出了这样的假设：重的物体比轻的物体下落得更快。然后，他将这一结论推断为“重”和“轻”的绝对属性，这些属性被认为控制着所有物理物体在与重量成比例的滑动速度上的下降。直到两千多年后伽利略进行了一次手术，这些非凡的“原理”才被废黜。
We must remember that Aristotle was not responsible for all the mistakes of his followers, especially the theologians of the Middle Ages who called him “The Philosopher,” and had available only a fraction of his published works. He above most of his contemporaries tried to study nature. He collected and classified specimens and even did some dissecting.
我们必须记住，亚里士多德并不对其追随者的所有错误负责，尤其是中世纪的神学家，他们称他为“哲学家”，并且只掌握了他已出版著作的一小部分。他比大多数同时代人都更努力地研究自然。他收集并分类了标本，甚至进行了一些解剖。
Language was reduced to an orderly instrument by the Greeks with rules of grammar. They worked up emotive associations of words through their marvelous poetry and drama; they inaugurated technical philosophy and formal logic. They were powerful reasoners. The world has seldom seen their like. But they were close enough to primitive backgrounds to carry over a large amount of word magic. Their early philosophers regarded words as possessing power in themselves, even as the infant and the conjure man regard them. To classify, some of them believed, was to name, and the name of a thing was its soul, its essence. Therefore to know the name was to have power over souls. This sorcery was known as the doctrine of the “Logos.” St. John begins his gospel with an echo of the doctrine: “In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.”
希腊人将语言简化为一种有语法规则的有序工具。他们通过精彩的诗歌和戏剧建立了文字的情感联想。他们开创了技术哲学和形式逻辑。他们是强有力的推理家。世界上很少见到他们这样的人。但它们足够接近原始背景，可以承载大量的文字魔法。他们的早期哲学家认为词语本身具有力量，就像婴儿和魔术师看待它们一样。他们中的一些人认为，分类就是命名，而事物的名称就是它的灵魂、它的本质。因此，知道这个名字就拥有控制灵魂的力量。这种巫术被称为“逻各斯”学说。圣约翰以呼应这个教义的方式开始他的福音书：“太初有道，道与神同在，道就是神。”
The power to reason is as helpful as it is human. But beware of idolizing reason as such. Reasoning for what? Where? When? If it is mental exercise from thought to word, it moves no farther forward than President Coolidge’s electric horse. The Greeks were the founders of metaphysics. “The effect of verbal symbols in the hands of metaphysicians,” observe Ogden and Richards, “is to keep inconsistent attitudes forcibly united, convincing human reason of the absence of logical inconsistency in the greatest of absurdities.”
推理的力量与人类一样有用。但要小心不要盲目崇拜理性。推理什么？在哪里？什么时候？如果这是从思想到言语的脑力锻炼，它的进步并不比柯立芝总统的电动马更远。希腊人是形而上学的创始人。奥格登和理查兹观察到，“形而上学家手中的语言符号的作用是将不一致的态度强行统一起来，使人类理性相信在最大的荒谬中不存在逻辑上的不一致。”
“The One,” “the Good,” and “Idea of Good” were identical in Plato’s mind. By his follower, Plotinus, on the contrary, “the One” is explicitly exalted above the image of “the One,” and transcends existence altogether. Indeed it does. Plato was frankly an idea man. He took the forms of solids which the mathematicians had discovered and moved them into his cosmology. A cube was the earth; a tetrahedron was fire; an octahedron was water; an icosahedron was air; while a dodecahedron was “the all thing.” No reasons were assigned: “Thus I conceive it, it is best.” He went on to conceive that the universe had a soul, moving in perpetual circles. Man’s soul was in his circular head. “God, imitating the spherical shape of the universe, enclosed the two divine courses in a spherical body, which we now term the head.” But God foresaw “that this head, being spherical, would roll down the hills and could not ascend steep places. To prevent this, a body with limbs was added, that it might be a locomotive for the head. As the fore parts are more honorable and regal than the hind parts, the gods made man’s locomotion chiefly progressive.”
在柏拉图的心目中，“一”、“善”和“善的理念”是相同的。相反，在他的追随者普罗提诺看来，“一”被明确地提升到“一”的形象之上，并且完全超越了存在。确实如此。坦率地说，柏拉图是一个有思想的人。他采用了数学家发现的固体形式，并将它们转移到他的宇宙学中。立方体就是地球；四面体是火；八面体是水；二十面体是空气；而十二面体就是“一切”。没有给出任何理由：“我认为这是最好的。”他继续认为宇宙有灵魂，永恒地循环运动。人的灵魂就在他的圆形脑袋里。 “上帝模仿宇宙的球形形状，将两个神圣的课程封闭在一个球形体内，我们现在将其称为头部。”但上帝预见到“这个头是球形的，会从山上滚下来，不能爬上陡峭的地方。为了防止这种情况，添加了一个有四肢的身体，它可能是头部的机车。由于前部比后部更加尊贵和高贵，众神使人类的运动主要是进步的。”
In spite of learned flights into the meaning of the liver and the intestines, Plato was scornful of scientific inquiry. “The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible background and therefore must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute intelligence. . . . It is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth.” Citing these lines, G. H. Lewes remarks that he does not quote them “for the poor pleasure of holding a great name in the light of ridicule, but to show how even a great intellect may unsuspectingly wander into absurdities when it quits the firm though laborious path of inductive inquiry.”
尽管柏拉图对肝脏和肠道的含义有了深入的了解，但他仍然蔑视科学探究。 “我们所看到的星空是在可见的背景上形成的，因此必然被认为远远低于绝对迅速和绝对智慧的真实运动。 。 。 。花费如此多的精力去调查他们的确切真相同样是荒谬的。” GH·刘易斯在引用这些诗句时表示，他引用这些诗句并不是“为了在嘲笑中保持伟大名声的可怜的快乐，而是为了表明，即使是伟大的知识分子，在离开坚定而艰苦的道路时，也可能毫无戒心地陷入荒谬”归纳探究。”
One can admire Plato and revere him for the Republic and other classics while smiling at his quaint astronomy and anatomy. But we must know where to draw the line. It is hard to root out of our minds the absolutes which his followers planted in the universities of Europe and America and which survive and multiply with vitality even today.
人们可以欣赏柏拉图，尊敬他的《理想国》和其他经典著作，同时对他古雅的天文学和解剖学感到微笑。但我们必须知道在哪里划清界限。他的追随者在欧洲和美国的大学里灌输的绝对观念，直到今天仍然充满活力并繁衍生息，我们很难从我们的头脑中根除这种观念。
Plato held that geometry represented eternal truth. The principles of geometry, he said, are independent of the human senses and an aid to spiritual perfection. Kant picked up this reasoning as a stick with which to beat the Materialists. One is not expected to attain spiritual perfection and enjoy himself at the same time. Euclid has been taught as a kind of moral discipline ever since.
柏拉图认为几何学代表永恒的真理。他说，几何原理独立于人类感官，有助于精神完美。康德把这个推理作为打败唯物主义者的棍棒。人们并不期望在达到精神完美的同时享受自己。从那时起，欧几里得就被当作一种道德纪律来教授。
In reading the extraordinary statements of ancient philosophers we must not forget Malinowski’s adventures in the Trobriand Islands. We cannot understand today what men writing twenty-five centuries ago actually said. We should have to go back and live in Athens or in Stagira to find the exact meanings. But we can come near enough to their mental processes—they were extremely civilized gentlemen—to warrant the strictures laid here upon their methods of acquiring knowledge.
在阅读古代哲学家的非凡论述时，我们绝不能忘记马林诺夫斯基在特罗布里恩群岛的冒险经历。今天我们无法理解二十五个世纪前的人们实际上所说的内容。我们应该回到雅典或斯塔吉拉生活才能找到确切的含义。但我们可以足够接近他们的心理过程——他们是极其文明的绅士——以证明这里对他们获取知识的方法的限制。
Some early philosophers believed that a number had to be either a boy or a girl. Even numbers were male; odd numbers were female. The circle was the most perfect form. The heavenly bodies were perfect. Therefore the heavenly bodies must move in circles. Centuries later, when Kepler showed that planets moved in ellipses, his findings were judged impious. The male sex was more perfect than the female. Therefore rounded eggs, being nearer circles, must be males. This conclusion was contemplated with equanimity for hundreds of years.
一些早期哲学家认为，一个数字必须是男孩或女孩。偶数为男性；奇数为女性。圆形是最完美的形式。天体是完美的。因此天体必定做圆周运动。几个世纪后，当开普勒证明行星以椭圆形运行时，他的发现被认为是不虔诚的。男性比女性更完美。因此，圆形的蛋，更接近圆形，一定是雄性。这个结论被人们平静地思考了数百年。
The magic-number brotherhood of Pythagoras, among other remarkable findings, established the following identities. The number 1 stood for reason, 2 for opinion, 3 for potency, 4 for justice, 5 for marriage. In the properties of 5 lay the secret of color; in 6, that of cold; in 7, that of health; in 8, that of love. Why love? Because 3 (potency) plus 5 (marriage) produces love. Star distances were a harmonic series, like the strings in lyre or harp—hence “the music of the spheres.” Perfect numbers were located where the factors of a number add up to the number itself, as in 6, 28, 496, 8,128. The boys had to sweat for the next one—33,550,336. These were identified with such things as the 6 days of creation, and the 28 days of the lunar month, to illustrate the perfection of the providential plan. The superiority of Achilles over Hector was demonstrated because the letters of Achilles’ name added to 1,276, while Hector batted only 1,225.
毕达哥拉斯的魔数兄弟会以及其他非凡的发现，确立了以下恒等式。数字1代表理性，2代表意见，3代表效力，4代表正义，5代表婚姻。 5的属性中蕴藏着色彩的秘密； 6、风寒； 7、健康； 8、关于爱情。为什么要爱？因为3（效力）加上5（婚姻）产生爱情。恒星距离是一个和声级数，就像竖琴或竖琴中的弦一样——因此是“球体的音乐”。完美数字位于数字的因数之和等于数字本身的位置，例如 6、28、496、8,128。男孩们必须为下一个——33,550,336——而努力。这些与创世的 6 天和阴历的 28 天等事物相一致，以说明天意计划的完美性。阿喀琉斯相对于赫克托的优势得到了体现，因为阿喀琉斯名字的字母增加到了 1,276 个，而赫克托只击球了 1,225 个。
The schoolmen. The “number” of the Beast in the Book of the Revelation had the Schoolmen of the Middle Ages calculating for centuries. Even Newton, in his old age, went number-chasing through the Book of Daniel. Peter Bungis, a Catholic theologian, wrote a treatise of seven hundred pages to prove that the number of the Beast, 666, was a cryptogram for the name of Martin Luther. Luther smartly returned the compliment by interpreting the number as a prophecy of the duration of the papal regime.
学童们。 《启示录》中兽的“数量”让中世纪的经院学者们计算了几个世纪。甚至牛顿在年老时，也通过《但以理书》追寻数字。天主教神学家彼得·邦吉斯 (Peter Bungis) 写了一篇七百页的论文，证明兽的数字 666 是马丁·路德名字的密码。路德巧妙地回应了这一赞美，将这个数字解释为对教皇政权持续时间的预言。
The alchemists, following Aristotle’s idea, had three elementary principles—sulphur, or the fire principle; mercury, or the liquid principle; salt, or the solid principle. Later it was held that phlogiston, or fire substance, escaped from materials when they burned. As it was known through experiment that metals increased their weight with burning, it followed that phlogiston had a negative weight. This gave the savants many a headache. The idea of “substance” dies hard. Not until centuries later did Lavoisier show that breathing, rusting, and burning were similar processes.
炼金术士遵循亚里士多德的思想，有三个基本原理：硫，或火原理；汞，或液体原理；盐，或固体原则。后来人们认为燃素或火物质在材料燃烧时从材料中逸出。通过实验得知，金属在燃烧时重量会增加，因此燃素的重量为负。这让很多学者头疼不已。 “实质”的观念很难消逝。直到几个世纪后，拉瓦锡才证明呼吸、生锈和燃烧是相似的过程。
The ensemble of the metaphysical attributes imagined by the theologian is but a shuffling and matching of pedantic dictionary adjectives. One feels that in the theologian’s hands they are only a set of titles obtained by a mechanical manipulation of synonyms; verbality has stepped into the place of vision.
神学家所想象的形而上属性的集合不过是迂腐的字典形容词的洗牌和搭配。人们觉得，在神学家的手中，它们只是通过机械地处理同义词而获得的一组标题；言语已经走进了视野。
So observes William James. Example: God, being the first cause, possesses existence a se; He is necessary and absolute, unlimited, infinitely perfect, one and only, spiritual, immutable, eternal, omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent. This is an impressive philological parade, but it gets one no nearer to an understanding of God.
威廉·詹姆斯如是说。例子：上帝作为第一因，拥有存在本身；他是必要的、绝对的、无限的、无限完美的、独一的、精神的、不变的、永恒的、全能的、全知的、无所不在的。这是一场令人印象深刻的语言学游行，但它并没有让人更接近对上帝的理解。
Antonio Pérez, the disgraced minister of Philip II, was apprehended by the Inquisition for threatening to cut off God’s nose. The Holy Office proceeded against him not for the threat, but for the anthropomorphism; heresy lay not in railing against God, but in holding that God had a nose. God was an essence and faceless. Just how the learned men reconciled this doctrine with the Biblical record that God made man in His own image escapes me. These abstractions, be it observed, were powerful enough to get men hanged, burned, and broken upon the rack.
腓力二世名誉扫地的大臣安东尼奥·佩雷斯因威胁要割掉上帝的鼻子而被宗教裁判所逮捕。教廷对他采取行动不是因为威胁，而是因为他拟人化。异端不在于抱怨上帝，而在于认为上帝有鼻子。上帝是一个本质并且没有面孔。我不知道学者们是如何将这一教义与《圣经》中上帝按照自己的形象造人的记载相协调的。值得注意的是，这些抽象概念的威力足以让人们被绞死、烧死或绞死在刑架上。
A Florentine doctor named Redi showed that dead meat could not turn into live maggots by itself. He placed a piece of gauze over the meat, thus preventing flies from laying eggs to produce maggots. The holy men were enraged, and charged Redi with having limited the “power of the Omnipotent.” When Galileo with his new telescope was able to show the moon with its mountains, and Jupiter with its satellites, the professor of philosophy at the University of Padua refused to look through it. He preferred to believe his mind rather than his eyes. The great earthquake at Lisbon in 1753 killed 60,000 people. The English clergy held that it was caused by the large number of Catholics in Portugal. The surviving Catholics held that it was caused by the heretic Protestants resident in the city.
一位名叫雷迪的佛罗伦萨医生表明，死肉本身无法变成活蛆。他在肉上放了一块纱布，这样可以防止苍蝇产卵生蛆。圣人们被激怒了，指责雷迪限制了“全能者的力量”。当伽利略用他的新望远镜能够显示月球及其山脉、木星及其卫星时，帕多瓦大学的哲学教授拒绝透过它进行观察。他更愿意相信自己的想法而不是自己的眼睛。 1753 年里斯本大地震造成 6 万人死亡。英国神职人员认为，这是葡萄牙天主教徒人数众多造成的。幸存的天主教徒认为这是由居住在该市的异端新教徒造成的。
After Galileo. Galileo is widely honored as the father of modern science. When he dropped the cannon balls from the Tower of Pisa he dramatized the operational approach, and put philosophy and theology on the defensive. Gradually the scientific method has gained standing and respectability, though not without violent conflict and the martyrdom of some of the early scientists. The latest major engagement was over Darwin, which lingered on to the Scopes trial in Tennessee.
伽利略之后。伽利略被广泛尊崇为现代科学之父。当他从比萨斜塔投下炮弹时，他戏剧化了操作方法，并将哲学和神学置于守势。科学方法逐渐获得了地位和尊重，尽管并非没有暴力冲突和一些早期科学家的殉难。最新的重大交战是关于达尔文案，该案一直持续到田纳西州的斯科普斯审判。
Early in the eighteenth century Bishop Berkeley published his famous Essay toward a New Theory of Vision. In it he argued matter out of all existence except as an idea in the mind of God. Says Boswell of this essay:
十八世纪初，伯克利主教发表了他著名的《新视觉理论论文》。在这篇文章中，他论证了物质除了作为上帝头脑中的一个想法之外，不存在于一切存在之中。博斯韦尔对这篇文章说：
After we came out of church, we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeley’s ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter, and that everything in the Universe is merely ideal. I observed that though we are satisfied that his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone till he rebounded from it, “I refute it thus.”
从教堂出来后，我们站在一起讨论了伯克利主教巧妙的诡辩，以证明物质不存在，宇宙中的一切都只是理想。我观察到，尽管我们确信他的学说不是真的，但我们无法反驳。我永远不会忘记约翰逊的回答，他用脚用力敲打一块大石头，直到他从石头上弹起来，“我这样反驳它。”
Another way to look at it would be to assume that a lethal epidemic wiped out the human race. Would the planet continue to turn upon its axis, the seasons go on following the precession of the equinoxes? Would the beasts, birds, and fishes pursue their immemorial customs in an environment still constrained within immemorial laws of energy and change? I am convinced not only that the planet would continue but that it would probably be improved. “What is man that thou shouldst be mindful of him?” . . . I would go and Hobie Baker would remain. I hope he would find enough to eat.
另一种看待它的方式是假设一种致命的流行病消灭了人类。地球会继续绕其轴旋转，季节会随着分点进动而继续吗？野兽、鸟类和鱼类是否会在一个仍然受到远古能量和变化法则限制的环境中追求它们远古的习俗？我坚信，这个星球不仅会继续存在，而且可能会得到改善。 “人算什么，你应该留意他吗？” 。 。 。我会走，霍比·贝克会留下来。我希望他能找到足够的食物。
A primitive linguistic outlook survives in the work of some profound modern thinkers. The technical philosophy of the nineteenth century was dominated by Idealism. In it, the elaboration of a monstrous word machinery—of which the Dialectic of Hegel provides an outstanding example—took the place of direct observation and research. Here is Herbert Spencer searching for word essence precisely as did the Greeks: “By comparing meanings in different connections, and observing what they have in common we learn the essential meaning of a word . . . let us ascertain the meaning of the word ‘good.’” The Eskimos of Greenland believe that a spiritual affinity exists between two persons of the same name. They would have no difficulty in following either Aristotle or Herbert Spencer. “The Sublime,” remarked Croce—apparently fed up—“is everything that is or will be so called by those who have employed or shall employ the name.”
一些深刻的现代思想家的作品中仍然保留着原始的语言观。十九世纪的技术哲学以唯心主义为主导。其中，对一种可怕的文字机器的阐述——黑格尔辩证法提供了一个突出的例子——取代了直接观察和研究。赫伯特·斯宾塞正是像希腊人一样寻找词的本质：“通过比较不同联系中的含义，并观察它们的共同点，我们可以了解一个词的本质含义……” 。 。让我们确定一下‘好’这个词的含义。”格陵兰岛的爱斯基摩人相信，两个同名的人之间存在着精神上的亲和力。他们不难追随亚里士多德或赫伯特·斯宾塞。 “崇高，”克罗齐显然已经厌倦了，“就是那些已经或将要使用这个名字的人所称呼的一切。”
Goethe’s Spiraltendenz was a triumph of inaccurate observation transformed into a Great Truth of the Romantic School. He sought to show that the upward growth of stems in plants was due to, a natural, inscrutable life force, and was male, while the spiral tendency of climbing plants was female. We remember that women were much identified with clinging vines in Goethe’s time. Numerology soared superbly among the Romanticists. The number 5 was taken to be Heaven’s own. Two British ornithologists, Swainson and Vigors, were able to deduce that all species, genera, and families had been arranged in quincunxes, or five systems. If you could not see quincunxes, you were a dolt or a knave. If you professed to see them, it was wiser not to describe what you saw, and in consequence the elect would not stoop to descriptions or proof. 1
歌德的《螺旋倾向》是不准确观察的胜利，转化为浪漫主义学派的伟大真理。他试图证明植物茎的向上生长是由于一种自然的、难以理解的生命力，并且是雄性的，而攀缘植物的螺旋趋势是雌性的。我们记得，在歌德时代，女性被视为攀附的藤蔓。命理学在浪漫主义者中飞速发展。数字5被认为是天堂自己的数字。两位英国鸟类学家斯温森和维戈尔斯推断出所有物种、属和科都排列成梅花形，即五个系统。如果你看不到梅花相，那你就是个傻瓜或无赖。如果你声称看到了它们，那么最好不要描述你所看到的，因此选民不会屈尊去描述或证明。 1
Van Wyck Brooks tells how New England seethed with philosophical discussion a century ago. Men argued for or against “potential presence,” “representative presence,” and “representative identity.” Blacksmiths and furriers as well as parsons and lawyers debated “free will” and “predestination,” wrangled over “natural ability,” “moral ability,” “God’s efficiency,” and “man’s agency.” Sometimes the interest in philosophy was morbid, as when children sat on “anxious seats” and cried because of the wickedness of their little hearts. One heard of “sweating” sermons, followed by “fainting” sermons, with “convulsion-fit” sermons as a grand climax.
范威克·布鲁克斯讲述了一个世纪前新英格兰如何热烈地进行哲学讨论。男性支持或反对“潜在存在”、“代表性存在”和“代表性身份”。铁匠和毛皮商以及牧师和律师争论“自由意志”和“预定论”，争论“自然能力”、“道德能力”、“上帝的效率”和“人的能动性”。有时，对哲学的兴趣是病态的，就像孩子们坐在“焦虑的座位”上，因为他们幼小的心灵的邪恶而哭泣。人们听说过“出汗”的讲道，然后是“昏厥”的讲道，最后以“抽搐”的讲道为高潮。
John Jay Chapman was a kind of American Dr. Johnson, fond of striking his foot against great stones. In 1897, he wrote the following letter to William James concerning Josiah Royce, then a towering figure in philosophy at Harvard:
约翰·杰伊·查普曼有点像美国的约翰逊博士，喜欢用脚踩大石头。 1897 年，他给威廉·詹姆斯写了一封关于当时哈佛大学哲学界泰斗乔赛亚·罗伊斯的信：
My dear Professor James,
我亲爱的詹姆斯教授，
I am driven to write to you because I so narrowly missed seeing you and regretted it so much. Also because I am concerned about Royce. I never heard a man talk so much nonsense in one evening—and a man too who is such a splendid fellow, a unique nature and a very wonderful mind. The inroads of Harvard University upon his intelligence, however, have been terrible. He said he was writing a paper on originality and his conversation betrayed some of the things he is going to say in it. This was that everything was imitative—in art you “imitate the ideal” This ought to be stopped. He is misleading the youth. I see why they killed Socrates. I say it is pernicious emptiness he is teaching your boys out there.
我迫不及待地给你写信，因为我差一点就错过了见到你的机会，并且对此感到非常遗憾。也是因为我担心罗伊斯。我从来没有听过一个人在一个晚上说这么多废话，而且他也是一个如此出色的人，有着独特的性格和非常奇妙的头脑。然而，哈佛大学对他智力的侵蚀是可怕的。他说他正在写一篇关于原创性的论文，而他的谈话背叛了他将在其中所说的一些内容。这就是一切都是模仿的——在艺术中你“模仿理想”，这应该停止。他在误导年轻人。我明白他们为什么杀苏格拉底了。我说他正在教你的孩子们这是有害的空虚。
I know you would say that it’s mere philosophy and not to be taken seriously; but these things do have some influence sometimes. That man—mind you, I love and revere him—but he’s not as interesting a man as he was ten years ago. His mind has less of life in it. His constant strain and endeavor to evacuate his mind and have nothing in it but destruction is beginning to tell. I hear he is going abroad. I am awfully glad. Let him have no money. Let him come in grinding contact with life. Let him go to Greece and get into a revolution—somewhere where he can’t think—I mean do this thing he does, which is not thinking. Let his mind get full of images and impressions, pains, hungers, contrasts—life, life, life. He’s drawing on an empty well.1
我知道你会说这只是哲学，不值得认真对待；但这些事情有时确实会产生一些影响。那个男人——请注意，我爱他并尊敬他——但他不再像十年前那样有趣了。他的头脑里的生命力越来越少。他不断的紧张和努力让自己的思想清空，除了毁灭之外什么都没有，这一切开始显现出来。听说他要出国了我非常高兴。让他没钱。让他与生活磨擦接触。让他去希腊，参加一场革命——在一个他无法思考的地方——我的意思是做他所做的事情，这不是思考。让他的头脑充满图像和印象、痛苦、饥饿、对比——生活、生活、生活。他正在一口空井上画画1
A generation ago philosophy, the queen of studies, was usually taught by the president of the college; in 1888 it was defined by the Century Dictionary as “The body of highest truth; the organized sum of science; the science of which all others are branches.” Observe how the philosophers refused to be elbowed out by science. No, indeed, they would calmly engulf it. Yet even the staid London Times was driven to check this omnivorousness: “In philosophy, as there is no objective standard, there is really no satisfactory reason why one opinion should be better than another.” The philosophers, said Einstein to an interviewer, play with the word “relativity” as a child plays with a doll. Bridgman gloomily predicted an era of debauched thinking as soon as philosophers should hear that in subatomic regions causality cannot be discovered. The era has begun. Maurice Maeterlinck solemnly told us that “all the revelations and apparitions of the Old and New Testaments come from four-dimensional beings; which is for that matter quite reasonable.” He could have made a fortune in Pasadena.
一代人以前，哲学是研究的女王，通常由学院院长教授； 1888年《世纪词典》将其定义为“最高真理的本体；科学的有组织的总和；所有其他科学都是其分支的科学。”观察哲学家如何拒绝被科学排挤。不，确实，他们会平静地吞没它。然而，即使是一本正经的《伦敦时报》也被迫去制止这种杂食性：“在哲学中，由于没有客观标准，所以确实没有令人满意的理由来说明一种观点应该比另一种观点更好。”爱因斯坦对采访者说，哲学家们玩“相对论”这个词就像孩子玩洋娃娃一样。当哲学家们听说在亚原子领域无法发现因果关系时，布里奇曼就悲观地预言了一个思想放荡的时代。时代已经开始。莫里斯·梅特林克郑重地告诉我们，“旧约和新约的一切启示和显现都来自于四维的存在；就此而言，这是相当合理的。”他本来可以在帕萨迪纳发大财。
Leonard Woolf has written a book attacking this land of thinking. He remarks:
伦纳德·伍尔夫写了一本攻击这片思想土地的书。他评论道：
The demand for absolute truth is in inverse proportion to the possibility of providing it. The savage insists upon knowing everything with complete certainty about the universe, how it works and what it all means. The more civilized men become, the more skeptical do they become. And with skepticism they learn to overcome the fear of mental vacuum, of uncertainty about the truth of things and the meaning of their own existence. It requires no little courage to stand up in the face of the universe and say: “I do not know.”
对绝对真理的需求与提供绝对真理的可能性成反比。野蛮人坚持要完全确定地了解宇宙的一切、宇宙如何运作以及它的意义。人们变得越文明，他们就越怀疑。带着怀疑，他们学会克服对精神真空、对事物真相和自身存在意义的不确定性的恐惧。面对宇宙站起来说：“我不知道”需要不小的勇气。
As an occasional lecturer, I am well aware that it takes resolution, if not courage, to stand up in front of the Middletown Open Forum and say to a questioner from the floor, “I do not know.” A kind of shock goes through the audience, as though one had uttered a naughty word. Yet sometimes I have seen that blunt declaration met, after a pause, with a clapping of hands. Perhaps the most important statement in the scientific discipline is “I do not know.”
作为一名临时讲师，我很清楚，站在米德尔敦开放论坛前对现场提问者说“我不知道”，即使不需要勇气，也需要决心。观众们感到一种震惊，仿佛说了一句难听的话。但有时候，我看到这种直率的宣言在停顿之后会引起一阵掌声。也许科学学科中最重要的陈述是“我不知道”。
An ancient impulse leads us to fill any vacuum either with truth as revealed through “authority,” or with the use of reason above and beyond the facts. The latter road is taken by many modern philosophers, including Bergson. Real facts, he tells us, are gained not by experience with the world outside, but by intuition:
一种古老的冲动引导我们要么用“权威”所揭示的真理，要么用超越事实的理性来填补任何真空。包括柏格森在内的许多现代哲学家都走后一条路。他告诉我们，真正的事实不是通过外部世界的经验获得的，而是通过直觉获得的：
What we have to do is to make a big act of perception, to embrace as wide a field as possible of past and present as a single fact directly known. . . . Intuition may be described as turning past and present into fact directly known by transferring it from mere matter into a creative process of duration.
我们要做的就是做出重大的感知行动，将过去和现在的尽可能广阔的领域包容为直接已知的单一事实。 。 。 。直觉可以被描述为通过将过去和现在从单纯的物质转变为持续的创造性过程，将过去和现在变成直接已知的事实。
The last sentence warrants a semantic translation:
最后一句需要语义翻译：
Intuition may be described as turning blab and blab into blab directly known by blabbing it from mere matter into a blab blab of blab.
直觉可以被描述为通过将纯粹的物质变成废话的废话，将废话和废话变成直接已知的废话。
Bergson begins with perceptions and then yanks in the facts. This gives a superior brand of truth. Hitler and his propaganda generals follow a similar technique to less gentle ends. Woolf legitimately inquires why metaphysicians like Bergson, Keyserling, and an Indian seer much respected in England, Sir S. Radhakrishnan, should stoop to the writing of books. Those who affirm that reality is nonlogical and then proceed to prove the improvable in logical French or English are in the difficult position of a snake trying to swallow itself. To make certain, C. E. M. Joad wrote a book to drive home the message of Radhakishnan, in which he states flatly that his hero has attained to truth about the universe which is “from its nature incommunicable.”
柏格森从感知开始，然后猛拉事实。这赋予了卓越的品牌真理。希特勒和他的宣传将军们也采用了类似的技巧，以达到不那么温和的目的。伍尔夫合理地询问了为什么像柏格森、凯瑟林和在英国备受尊敬的印度先知拉达克里希南爵士这样的形而上学家应该屈尊去写书。那些断言现实是非逻辑的，然后用逻辑法语或英语证明现实可以改进的人，陷入了一条试图吞下自己的蛇的困境。为了确定这一点，CEM 乔德写了一本书来传达拉达基什南的信息，他在书中直言不讳地表示，他的英雄已经获得了关于宇宙的真理，而宇宙的真理“从本质上来说是无法传达的”。
Here is the majestic Spengler, star of the declining West:
这是威严的斯宾格勒，衰落的西方明星：
I see further than others. . . . Destiny depends on quite other, robuster forces. Human history is war history. . . . Barbarism is that which I call strong race, the eternal warlike in the type of the beast-of-prey man.
我比别人看得更远。 。 。 。命运取决于其他更强大的力量。人类历史就是战争史。 。 。 。野蛮就是我所说的强种族，是猛兽人类型中永恒的好战者。
Violence, greed, injustice, are raw, red, and real; liberty, happiness, peace, are “ineffective dreams.” Now the trouble with this stuff is not so much the savagery we read into the words as their vagueness and lack of meaning. “Barbarism is that which I call blab blab, the blab blab in the type of blab man.” Poor Leonard Woolf rolls up his sleeves and argues with Spengler for page upon page. But there is nothing to argue about, nothing susceptible to operational test anywhere in sight. I withdraw my salute of honor, given to philosophers at the beginning of the chapter, in the case of Spengler. The man should have been put in the hands of psychiatrists.
暴力、贪婪、不公正，是原始的、红色的、真实的；自由、幸福、和平，都是“无效的梦想”。现在，这些东西的问题不在于我们读到的文字的野蛮性，而在于它们的模糊性和缺乏意义。 “野蛮就是我所说的胡言乱语，胡言乱语的那种胡言乱语的人。”可怜的伦纳德·伍尔夫卷起袖子，与斯宾格勒一页一页地争论。但没有什么可争论的，在任何地方都没有什么可以进行操作测试的。我撤回在本章开头向斯宾格勒的哲学家致敬的荣誉。该男子应该被送去接受精神科医生的治疗。
How often have you stumbled across such gems as this, quoted by Bell?
贝尔引用的这句话，你有多少次偶然发现过这样的瑰宝？
Truth is ever becoming, it never is. No error is ever overcome once and for all; it is only diminishing as truth Increases. Truth is the act of this becoming. Truth is the union of the dreamer and the dream; in so far as the dreamer is human, truth is human. As a mathematician might say, truth is the approach of uncertainty to certainty as an asymptote.
真理总是在变化，但它从来都不是。没有任何错误是可以一劳永逸地克服的；随着真理的增加，它只会减少。真理就是这种生成的行为。真理是梦想家与梦想的结合；只要做梦者是人，真理就是人。正如数学家可能会说的那样，真理是作为渐近线的不确定性向确定性的逼近。
The student of semantics grinds his teeth. This is the sort of blather which Adam1 and Mrs. Adam1 swallow by the bucketful. It goes down as smoothly as an advertisement for toothpaste. It sounds wise. It gives a feeling of comfort. It is undeniably learned, particularly the shrewd crack about the asymptote. And it is nonsense adulterated with perhaps the tiniest flicker of meaning.
语义学的学生咬牙切齿。亚当和亚当夫人就吞下这样的废话。它就像牙膏广告一样顺利地下去了。听起来很明智。它给人一种舒适的感觉。不可否认，这是有学问的，尤其是关于渐近线的精明破解。这是胡言乱语，也许掺杂着最微小的意义。
Charles Hartshorne in a recent book, Beyond Humanism, lines up and slaughters such thinkers as Freud, Marx, Dewey, Santayana, Russell, Croce. Let an able reviewer, Eliseo Vivas, continue the story.
查尔斯·哈茨霍恩（Charles Hartshorne）在新书《超越人文主义》（Beyond Humanism）中，对弗洛伊德、马克思、杜威、桑塔亚那、罗素、克罗齐等思想家进行了排列和屠杀。让一位能干的评论家 Eliseo Vivas 来继续讲述这个故事吧。
His thesis . . . is that the Universe and the electrons may be said to feel and think. . . . If the Universe feels and thinks, God may have imagination and memory. Therefore He has imagination and memory. All this is reinforced by the claim that only upon this thesis can certain facts be explained. These facts boil down to the assertion that our spontaneous ethical convictions and deep human needs demand this conception of God-Nature if we are to achieve personal integration. What integration is, we are not told. . . . The clever use of the old tricks of apologetics—the claim to be the sole sanction of science; the sharp distinction, when evidence is untoward, between science and philosophy; the facile demonstration of the ignorance of those one is opposed to, and the scornful arrogance which grows from a monopoly of the truth. . . .
他的论文。 。 。宇宙和电子可以说是有感觉和思考的。 。 。 。如果宇宙有感觉和思考，上帝可能有想象力和记忆。因此他有想象力和记忆力。所有这一切都被这样的主张所强化：只有根据这个论点才能解释某些事实。这些事实归结为这样的断言：如果我们要实现个人整合，我们自发的道德信念和深刻的人类需求需要这种神自然的概念。整合是什么，我们没有被告知。 。 。 。巧妙地运用了护教学的老把戏——声称是科学的唯一认可；当证据不充分时，科学与哲学之间存在明显的区别；反对者轻率地表现出无知，以及因垄断真理而产生的轻蔑傲慢。 。 。 。
I do not know Professor Hartshorne, but I recognize a philosopher hitting on all sixteen cylinders.
我不认识哈茨霍恩教授，但我认得一位哲学家，他的十六个气缸都在工作。
I could continue indefinitely with citations of this nature, but we have many dragons to pursue in other fields. If it be objected that the citations are more or less torn from their contexts, I admit it. But you ought to see the contexts. Let us conclude with a sad exhibit. It comes from a brilliant young educator, R. M. Hutchins, who recently published a book, The Higher Learning in America.
我可以无限期地继续引用这种性质，但我们在其他领域还有很多龙要追求。如果有人反对说这些引文或多或少脱离了上下文，我承认。但你应该看看上下文。让我们以一个悲伤的展览来结束吧。它来自一位才华横溢的年轻教育家 RM Hutchins，他最近出版了一本书《美国的高等教育》。
We see, then, that we may get order in the higher learning by removing from it the elements which disorder it today, and these are vocationalism and unqualified empiricism. If when these elements are removed we pursue the truth for its own sake in the light of some principles of order, such as metaphysics, we shall have a rational plan for a university. We shall be able to make a university a true center of learning; we shall be able to make it the home of creative thought.
因此，我们看到，我们可以通过消除当今造成高等教育混乱的因素，使高等教育变得秩序井然，这些因素就是职业主义和无条件的经验主义。如果当这些因素被消除后，我们根据某些秩序原则（例如形而上学）来追求真理本身，我们就会对大学有一个合理的规划。我们将能够使大学成为真正的学习中心；我们将能够使它成为创造性思维的家园。
The subjects to be taught in this ideal university are grammar, rhetoric, logic, Euclid, and the classics—those books which have survived through the ages, many of them written in the ancient and medieval periods.
这所理想的大学要教授的科目是语法、修辞学、逻辑、欧几里得和经典著作——那些历代流传下来的书籍，其中许多是在古代和中世纪时期写成的。
Back, young men and women of the twentieth century, to the broad bosom of Plato! Within these academic shades let it be known that Galileo flung his cannon balls in vain; Bruno died at the stake to no purpose; Einstein discovered nothing of educational importance. Dr. Hutchins is too young to be so tired. The intellectual elite has been reared on the classics for hundreds of years. Look at the world they have helped to make!
二十世纪的青年男女，回到柏拉图宽阔的怀抱吧！在这些学术色彩中，人们知道伽利略徒劳地投掷炮弹；布鲁诺毫无意义地死在火刑柱上。爱因斯坦没有发现任何具有教育意义的东西。哈钦斯博士还太年轻，不会这么累。数百年来，知识精英都是在经典中成长起来的。看看他们帮助创造的世界！

TURN WITH THE LOGICIANS
与逻辑学家一起转动
ARISTOTLE is credited with being the father of formal logic. Again we must salute respectfully before laying on. The technique was an attempt to formulate the laws of thought. Aristotle was trying to do precisely what modern students of semantics are trying to do—to make communication more dependable. It was a new tiling in human intercourse, and for the will behind the attempt, all praise.
亚里士多德被誉为形式逻辑之父。再次，我们在躺下之前必须恭敬地行礼。该技术是一种制定思维法则的尝试。亚里士多德试图做的正是现代语义学学生正在尝试做的事情——让交流更加可靠。这是人类交往中的一种新方式，对于这一尝试背后的意愿，所有人都表示赞扬。
Formal logic fails us because of its assumptions. The postulates from which the mechanism springs are normally abstractions of a high order, words rather than things. The finest of automobiles will not run on a road of air; it must have solid ground under the wheels. The Greeks, with their assumption that words were real things, naturally enough soared into rarefied regions. Human thinking has been short of oxygen ever since. Dr. Hutchins, one takes it, would continue to keep our heads in the stratosphere. “Logos” is Greek for “word”: “logic” is the manipulation of words.
形式逻辑因其假设而使我们失败。产生该机制的假设通常是高阶的抽象，是文字而不是事物。最好的汽车也不会在空中行驶；车轮下方必须有坚实的地面。希腊人假设文字是真实的事物，自然而然地就进入了稀有地区。人类的思维从此缺氧。人们认为，哈钦斯博士将继续保持我们的头脑在平流层。 “Logos”在希腊语中是“词”的意思：“逻辑”是对词的操纵。
Major premise: Language as currently used is often meaningless.
大前提：当前使用的语言通常毫无意义。
Minor premise: Chase uses current language to demonstrate the above.
小前提：蔡斯使用当前语言来证明上述内容。
Therefore: Chase is meaningless.
因此：追逐是没有意义的。
You see how mercilessly formal logic can dispose of me. The trick lies in giving one value to the term “current language,” which in reality has many values. The trick is more apparent in a stock sample of medieval logic:
你看，形式逻辑是如何无情地对待我的。诀窍在于为“当前语言”一词赋予一个值，而实际上它有很多值。这个技巧在中世纪逻辑的库存样本中更加明显：
Major premise: No cat has eight tails.
大前提：没有猫有八条尾巴。
Minor premise: Every cat has one more tail than no cat.
小前提：每只猫都比没有猫多一条尾巴。
Therefore: Every cat has nine tails.
因此：每只猫都有九条尾巴。
Here are the three laws of formal logic. Observe them carefully, for their reverberations have been profound.
这是形式逻辑的三个定律。仔细观察它们，因为它们的影响是深远的。
The law of identity. A is A. Pigs is pigs.
身份法则。 A是A。猪就是猪。
The law of the excluded middle. Everything is either A or not-A. Everything is either pigs or not-pigs.
排中法则。一切要么是 A，要么不是 A。一切要么是猪，要么不是猪。
The law of contradiction. Nothing is both A and not-A. Nothing is both pigs and not-pigs.
矛盾律。没有什么东西既是 A 又不是 A。没有什么东西既是猪又不是猪。
The symbol “A” is always and forever the symbol “A.” Good. The symbol “pigs” is always and forever the symbol “pigs.” Again good. Observe that no referents are mentioned. For symbols in our heads, the laws are incontrovertible. But the instant we turn to the world outside and substitute an actual grunting animal, the laws collapse. They collapsed to the vast perplexity of the logical station agent in Ellis Parker Butler’s famous story Pigs Is Pigs, where the animals involved were guinea pigs. Then there is the story, cited by Graham Wallas, of the bewildered porter in Punch who had to arrange the subtleties of nature according to the unsubtle tariff schedule of his company. “Cats is dogs, and guinea pigs is dogs, but this ’ere tortoise is a hinsect.”
符号“A”始终是符号“A”。好的。 “猪”这个符号永远都是“猪”这个符号。又好。请注意，没有提及任何指称。对于我们头脑中的符号来说，规律是无可争议的。但当我们转向外部世界并用真正的咕噜声动物代替时，法律就崩溃了。埃利斯·帕克·巴特勒（Ellis Parker Butler）的著名故事《猪就是猪》（Pigs Is Pigs）中，所涉及的动物是豚鼠，这让车站特工逻辑性地大惑不解。格雷厄姆·沃拉斯（Graham Wallas）引用了一个故事，讲述的是庞奇（Punch）的一位困惑的搬运工，他必须根据他公司毫不微妙的关税表来安排自然的微妙之处。 “猫是狗，豚鼠是狗，但这只乌龟是昆虫。”
The sow Aphrodite1 is not the boar Hercules1, while the characteristics of Aphrodite as a suckling are very different from those of Aphrodite the accommodating mother. We know from earlier chapters that the characteristics of Aphrodite now are different from those one second earlier or one second later. Not by much, but by enough to destroy the perfection of identity. A rocket is always the same rocket. True for words, but not for that nonverbal event in space-time which blazes in glory and falls a charred stick as we watch it; not for a mushroom full-blown today and underground yesterday; not for a rose, withered now and lovely a week ago; not for an ice-cream cone five minutes in the sun; not for an egg warm from the nest and sampled two weeks later without benefit of refrigeration; not for ginger ale corked and uncorked; not for a pond of water at 0° + C. and getting colder. In that water you can drown tonight, and on it you can walk safely in the morning.
母猪阿佛洛狄忒1不是公猪赫拉克勒斯1，而乳儿阿佛洛狄忒的特征与包容母亲阿佛洛狄忒的特征截然不同。我们从前面的章节中知道，现在的阿芙罗狄蒂的特征与前一秒或后一秒有所不同。虽然不是太多，但足以破坏身份的完美性。火箭始终是同一个火箭。对于言语来说是这样，但对于时空中的非言语事件却不然，当我们看着它时，它在荣耀中闪耀，然后落下一根烧焦的棍子；不是今天成熟、昨天在地下的蘑菇；不是一朵玫瑰，现在已经枯萎，一周前还很可爱；不是为了在阳光下晒五分钟的蛋卷冰淇淋；不适用于从巢中取暖并在两周后在没有冷藏的情况下取样的鸡蛋；不适用于带塞和未塞的姜汁汽水；不适用于 0° + C 且越来越冷的池塘水。今晚你可能会淹死在水中，但早上你可以在上面安全行走。
We have no knowledge of anything in the real world which is not a process, and so continually changing its characteristics, slowly or rapidly as men measure intervals. The early Greek logicians did not examine referents for “pigs,” “mushrooms,” “eggs,” and “ponds.”
我们对现实世界中任何不是一个过程的事物一无所知，因此随着人们测量间隔而不断地缓慢或快速地改变其特征。早期的希腊逻辑学家没有检查“猪”、“蘑菇”、“鸡蛋”和“池塘”的指称。
“Everything is either A or not-A.” The law of the excluded middle looks more susceptible to operations. Pigs as a genus can be distinguished scientifically from other animals. For one thing, they will not interbreed. But eons ago, pigs and some animals not-pigs were united in a common evolutionary ancestor. A major count of the theologians against Darwin was that he broke up the parade into Noah’s Ark and so violated the law of the excluded middle. There is nothing eternal about the genus pig; the distinction is valid only for a period, long, to be sure, but not indefinite.
“一切要么是 A，要么不是 A。”排中法则看起来更容易受到操作的影响。猪作为一个属可以从科学上与其他动物区分开来。一方面，它们不会杂交。但很久以前，猪和一些非猪的动物被团结在一个共同的进化祖先中。神学家反对达尔文的一个主要罪名是，他扰乱了进入诺亚方舟的游行队伍，因此违反了排斥中间法则。猪属没有什么永恒的东西；当然，这种区别只在一段时间内有效，很长一段时间，但不是无限期的。
Shifting from pigs to living-things-as-a-class, the law of the excluded middle might read “Every living thing is either an animal or a plant.” It was so employed by biologists for centuries. We still play the game of twenty questions on the animal, vegetable, mineral basis. In recent years a number of organisms have been studied which defy the distinction. A class of living things has been observed whose metabolism under certain conditions follows the classification of “plants,” under other conditions that of “animals.” Thus Euglena, a little unicellular water organism, becomes green in abundant sunlight and behaves like a “plant.” Remove the light, the green color disappears, and Euglena proceeds to digest carbohydrates like an “animal,” rather than synthesizing them like a plant. Or take the ascidians. The formation of cellulose by an organism has long been considered a fundamental property of plants. The ascidians have been classed as animals, but they produce cellulose.
从猪转向生物类，排中法则可能会变成“所有生物要么是动物，要么是植物”。几个世纪以来，生物学家一直如此使用它。我们仍然玩关于动物、植物、矿物基础的二十个问题的游戏。近年来，人们对许多生物体进行了研究，但这些生物体却无法区分。人们已经观察到一类生物，它们的新陈代谢在某些条件下遵循“植物”的分类，在其他条件下遵循“动物”的分类。因此，眼虫，一种小型的单细胞水生物，在充足的阳光下会变成绿色，表现得像一棵“植物”。去掉光线，绿色消失，眼虫就会像“动物”一样消化碳水化合物，而不是像植物一样合成碳水化合物。或者以海鞘为例。长期以来，生物体形成纤维素一直被认为是植物的基本特性。海鞘被归类为动物，但它们产生纤维素。
What is the filtrable virus responsible for rust on tobacco plants—to shift the referent again? Is it life or not-life? The question is meaningless. It “is” whatever it is found and described to be by the scientists performing the operations. The philosopher can refuse to look through the microscope, but the scientist must examine the organism and renounce rigid classifications. The law of the excluded middle is an unreliable guide to knowledge. The law of contradiction—“Nothing is both A and not-A”—is equally unreliable. Euglena is both “plant” and “animal.”
造成烟草植物锈病的可过滤病毒是什么——再次改变所指对象？是生命还是非生命？这个问题毫无意义。它“就是”执行操作的科学家发现和描述的任何东西。哲学家可以拒绝通过显微镜观察，但科学家必须检查有机体并放弃严格的分类。排中法则是不可靠的知识指南。矛盾律——“没有什么东西既是 A 又不是 A”——同样不可靠。眼虫既是“植物”又是“动物”。
The University of Chicago Press is to publish, probably in 1939, the first volumes of an entirely new encyclopedia, the conception of Dr. Otto Neurath, director of the International Foundation of Visual Education. Dr. Neurath is a kind of pioneer in semantics. He believes in going to things wherever possible, rather than to words. He has no serious objection to the great encyclopedias now in existence, but he wants also a new type which will integrate and unify scientific records so that advances in one field will be communicated more readily to workers in other fields, and bring advances there. Although we talk about Science with a capital S, we actually have scores of disciplines under this abstraction. Some of them are out of step with others. If students used similar terms, the new encyclopedia would be unnecessary. As they do not, we have a babel of scientific terminologies. C. F. Kettering, the man who invented the self-starter for automobiles, provides an excellent illustration. The pure research scientist will say, “Chlorophyll makes food by photosynthesis.” The practical engineer does not know what he is talking about. But if the statement is rephrased, “Green leaves build up food with the help of light,” anyone can understand it. So, says Kettering, if we are going to surmount the boundaries between different kinds of technical men: “The first thing to do is to get them to speak the same language.”
芝加哥大学出版社可能会在 1939 年出版一本全新百科全书的第一卷，这是国际视觉教育基金会主任 Otto Neurath 博士的构想。 Neurath 博士是语义学领域的先驱。他相信尽可能采取行动，而不是空谈。他并不严重反对现有的伟大百科全书，但他还想要一种新的类型，能够整合和统一科学记录，以便一个领域的进步能够更容易地传达给其他领域的工作者，并带来进步。虽然我们谈论科学时用大写的 S，但实际上我们在这个抽象概念下有许多学科。其中一些与其他人不一致。如果学生使用类似的术语，新的百科全书就没有必要了。由于他们不这样做，我们就有了一堆科学术语。汽车自启动装置的发明人 CF Kettering 提供了一个很好的例子。纯粹的研究科学家会说：“叶绿素通过光合作用制造食物。”实际工程师不知道他在说什么。但如果这句话被改写为“绿叶在光的帮助下积累食物”，任何人都可以理解。因此，凯特林说，如果我们要超越不同类型的技术人员之间的界限：“首先要做的就是让他们说同一种语言。”
Take the classical row between the advocates of free will and of determinism, which has filled many library shelves. Is man a free agent, or is he foredoomed by a merciless fate to act thus and so all the days of his life? Such terms are without referents as they stand. They are breeders of bad blood and confusion. When a physicist says that an atom is “free,” he does not mean in this context that Atom1 is a rugged individualist with a mind of his own prepared to tolerate no nonsense from an interfering government. He means that the motions of atoms are subject to chance. He uses the word “free” in a statistical sense, talking mathematical language. But sociologists and even biologists associate responsibility with “free will”; while the philosopher, unless clubbed into insensibility, will drag the idea into a totally different concept, and, if he belong to the free-will fraternity, will identify Atom1 with Adam1 (A is A) and triumphantly assert that “science proves the universal principle of free will.”
以自由意志和决定论倡导者之间的经典争论为例，这种争论已经摆满了许多图书馆的书架。人是一个自由的行动者，还是他被无情的命运注定要终其一生如此行事？这些术语本身没有指称。他们是仇恨和混乱的滋生者。当一位物理学家说原子是“自由的”时，他在这种情况下的意思并不是说 Atom1 是一个坚定的个人主义者，有自己的思想，准备不容忍来自干涉政府的胡言乱语。他的意思是原子的运动是偶然的。他在统计意义上使用“自由”这个词，谈论数学语言。但社会学家甚至生物学家将责任与“自由意志”联系在一起；而哲学家，除非陷入麻木不仁的境地，否则会将这个想法拖入一个完全不同的概念，并且，如果他属于自由意志兄弟会，他会将原子1等同于亚当1（A是A），并得意洋洋地断言“科学证明了普遍性”。自由意志原则。”
When Friedrich Wöhler synthesized urea, chemists refused to believe their ears. Why? Because the chemists of the time had “organic” and “inorganic” fixed as entities, and never the twain should meet. Wöhler took inorganic materials and made them behave like an organic compound. The categories were sundered, and the chemises were profoundly shocked. They did not realize that “organic” and “inorganic” were in their heads, and that nature was innocent of the distinction. Again consider the mighty battle which has raged between the biological “formalists” and “functionalists.” A scientist told me recently that the most exciting work in biology is now being done by chemists, because chemists are not handicapped by biological language. Indeed, this illustrates a healthy movement now becoming common. We find biologists in physics laboratories such as the Bartol Foundation in Swarthmore. We find mathematicians in biological laboratories. Some day we may find an engineer or a psychologist revolutionizing economic concepts.
当弗里德里希·维勒合成尿素时，化学家们拒绝相信自己的耳朵。为什么？因为当时的化学家将“有机”和“无机”固定为实体，并且两者永远不应该相遇。维勒采用无机材料，使它们表现得像有机化合物。类别被打破，衬衣也受到了极大的震惊。他们没有意识到“有机”和“无机”就在他们的头脑中，而大自然并没有这种区别。再次考虑一下生物学“形式主义者”和“功能主义者”之间激烈的战斗。一位科学家最近告诉我，生物学中最令人兴奋的工作现在正在由化学家完成，因为化学家不会受到生物语言的阻碍。事实上，这说明健康的运动正在变得普遍。我们在物理实验室（例如斯沃斯莫尔的巴托尔基金会）找到了生物学家。我们在生物实验室里找到数学家。有一天，我们可能会发现一位工程师或心理学家彻底改变了经济概念。
A further difficulty with formal logic is that the word is everything and the speaker nothing. Take the famous remark of Epimenides:
形式逻辑的另一个困难是，词语就是一切，而说话者什么也不是。以埃庇米尼得斯的名言为例：
Major premise: All Cretans are liars. (All Cretans are A’s.)
大前提：所有克里特岛人都是骗子。 （所有克里特岛人都是A。）
Minor premise: Epimenides is a Cretan. (Epimenides is an A.)
小前提：埃庇米尼德斯是克里特岛人。 （埃庇米尼德是 A。）
Therefore: Epimenides is a liar. (A is A, the first law.)
因此：埃庇米尼得斯是个骗子。 （A 是 A，第一定律。）
If Epimenides is a liar, even a journeyman logician can easily prove that everything he says is a lie; so all Cretans are not liars, and the syllogism contradicts itself. Epimenides obviously meant all other Cretans were liars. But what Epimenides meant must not be inquired into; it is psychological data, not verbal, and inadmissible. A useful logic, remarks F. C. S. Schiller, would not consider it fair to pit the meaning of words against the meaning of the man who used them, nor regard it as “illogical’’ to ascertain his actual meaning.
如果埃皮米尼德斯是个骗子，那么即使是熟练的逻辑学家也能轻易证明他所说的一切都是谎言；因此，并非所有克里特岛人都说谎，而三段论本身就自相矛盾。埃庇米尼得斯显然意味着所有其他克里特岛人都是骗子。但埃庇米尼得斯的意思是不必探究的。这是心理数据，而不是口头数据，是不可接受的。 FCS席勒评论说，一个有用的逻辑不会认为将单词的含义与使用它们的人的含义进行比较是不公平的，也不认为确定其实际含义是“不合逻辑的”。
How much human misery has flowed from holding a person strictly accountable for what he said, rather than for what he meant? The overheard phrase “I’d like to kill that man!” in some jurisdictions might send a person to the gallows—if the man were subsequently murdered—when all that the speaker meant was that he did not like the chap. You and I used the line often as children, and may do so today in moments of exasperation.
要求一个人严格遵守他所说的话而不是他的意思，这给人类带来了多少痛苦？无意中听到的一句话“我想杀了那个人！”在某些司法管辖区，如果一个人随后被谋杀，那么当说话者的意思只是他不喜欢这个人时，可能会将一个人送上绞刑架。你和我小时候经常使用这句话，今天在愤怒的时刻也可能会这样做。
Logicians tend to oppose the scientific method, because the latter is flexible and frequently changes its deductions and “laws” as more facts come in. This horrifies the formalists, for indeed the progression of actual science is formally indefensible. As the scientific method made headway, the brilliant idea occurred to the logicians that if they studied the forms of scientific thought while disregarding the matter, they could sit in judgment on the sciences. They could criticize all knowledge without producing or even acquiring any. A better method for developing a superiority complex it is difficult to imagine.
逻辑学家倾向于反对科学方法，因为后者是灵活的，并且随着更多事实的出现而经常改变其推论和“定律”。这让形式主义者感到恐惧，因为实际上科学的进步在形式上是站不住脚的。随着科学方法取得进展，逻辑学家们想到了一个绝妙的想法：如果他们研究科学思维的形式而忽视物质，他们就可以对科学做出判断。他们可以批评所有知识，而不产生甚至获得任何知识。很难想象有更好的方法来培养优越感。
We are now in a position to see why Korzybski terms his study “non-Aristotelian.” “A is A” is the law of identity. Against unwarranted identification Korzybski delivers his major attack. He constantly warns of the subject-predicate form, and the verb “is.” Symbolic A‘s as they stand have no referents in the outside world. It is with this world that we must come to terms. Actual A’s in the form of rockets, ice-cream cones, or stones, are never completely identical, and to use a language structure which makes them so falsifies evaluation of the environment. It is like trusting our lives in traffic to a taxi-driver who is color-blind. In justice to Aristotle, C. J. Keyser points out that the great philosopher did note the danger of employing the “is” of identity, uncritically. Many of his followers, especially in the Middle Ages, forgot the warning.
我们现在可以明白为什么科尔日布斯基将他的研究称为“非亚里士多德主义”。 “A is A”是同一律。针对未经证实的身份识别，科尔日布斯基发起了他的重大攻击。他不断地警告主谓形式和动词“is”。象征性的 A 在外部世界中没有任何指称。我们必须与这个世界达成协议。火箭、蛋卷冰淇淋或石头形式的实际 A 永远不会完全相同，并且使用使它们如此伪造的语言结构对环境的评估。这就像把我们在交通中的生命托付给一个色盲的出租车司机一样。为了公正地对待亚里士多德，CJ Keyser 指出，这位伟大的哲学家确实注意到了不加批判地使用身份的“是”的危险。他的许多追随者，尤其是中世纪的追随者，忘记了这个警告。
You will be glad to learn, if you do not already know it, that in 1930 Lucasiewicz and Tarski invented a workable, consistent, many-valued logic, superseding the creaking uncertainties of Formal. Bell calls it one of the four great steps in the development of the scientific method. The first was the geometry of the Egyptian pyramid-builders; the second was Pythagoras’ discovery of the nature of proof; the third was Lobatchevsky’s non-Euclidean geometry. With the aid of this many-valued logic the mind can attack, rather than avoid by an endless series of tautologies, the problem of knowledge.
如果您还不知道的话，您会很高兴了解到，Lucasiewicz 和 Tarski 在 1930 年发明了一种可行的、一致的、多值的逻辑，取代了形式化的不确定性。贝尔称其为科学方法发展的四大步骤之一。第一个是埃及金字塔建造者的几何形状；第二个是毕达哥拉斯发现了证明的本质；第三个是洛巴切夫斯基的非欧几何。借助这种多值逻辑，心灵可以攻击知识问题，而不是通过一系列无休止的同义反复来回避知识问题。
Let us find examples of these various sorts of logic:
让我们找到这些不同逻辑的例子：
One-valued: Contemporary events make communism inevitable in America.
单一价值观：当代事件使共产主义在美国不可避免。
Two-valued: Events make either communism or fascism inevitable in America. (This is the vicious “either-or” pair.)
双值：事件使得共产主义或法西斯主义在美国不可避免。 （这是恶性的“非此即彼”对。）
Many-valued: The American Government may evolve into one of a variety of political forms, some of them more dictatorial, some less so than the present government.
多价值的：美国政府可能演变成多种政治形式之一，其中一些比现任政府更独裁，一些则不那么独裁。
One-valued and two-valued logics are useful in special cases. It is trying to impose them on the total scene which is intolerable. Useful examples:
一值和二值逻辑在特殊情况下很有用。它试图将它们强加于整个场景，这是无法容忍的。有用的例子：
One-valued: If you fall into deep water you must swim.
一值：如果你掉进深水里，你必须游泳。
Two-valued: If you fall out of a canoe into deep water, you can either swim for shore or cling to the overturned canoe.
双值：如果您从独木舟上掉入深水中，您可以游向岸边或抓住翻倒的独木舟。
On a cold winter day in the depth of the depression, a shanty colony in New York City was uprooted to give ground for a new building. The sob sisters of the metropolitan newspapers gathered at the scene to tell of the poor starvelings driven from their shacks. But obviously nothing could be done about it. To give these people a dole, in 1931, would have been to establish a dangerous precedent. “The eviction of these unfortunates,” observes Thurman Arnold, who tells the story, “was a symbol of a faith that economic competence can only be developed by refusing to protect incompetence.” A lesson, painful but necessary, was being taught.
在一个寒冷的冬日，在大萧条深处，纽约市的一个棚户区被连根拔起，为新建筑腾出地方。都市报纸的姐妹们哭泣着聚集在现场，讲述那些可怜的挨饿者被赶出棚屋的故事。但显然对此无能为力。如果在 1931 年给这些人发放救济金，就会开创一个危险的先例。讲述这个故事的瑟曼·阿诺德说：“驱逐这些不幸的人，象征着一种信念，即只有拒绝保护无能者，才能发展经济能力。”一个痛苦但必要的教训正在被教导。
As the work proceeded, two men were discovered unconscious under one of the huts. Thereupon the old logic went by the board and a new and happier one entered. The idea vanished that it was wrong to protect citizens from the results of their own incompetence. Twenty thousand dollars’ worth of ambulances, stretchers, drugs, pulmotors, accompanied by a corps of internes and nurses, rushed to the scene with sirens and horns at full throat. The sick men were transferred to hospital surroundings which a millionaire could not have afforded fifty years ago. “Thus a practical and humanitarian attitude develops techniques and not logical arguments. A rational moral attitude develops philosophers and priests rather than techniques.”
随着工作的进行，有人在其中一间小屋下发现了两名昏迷不醒的男子。于是，旧的逻辑就消失了，一种新的、更快乐的逻辑出现了。保护公民免受自身无能后果的影响是错误的想法消失了。价值两万美元的救护车、担架、药品、呼吸机，在一群实习生和护士的陪同下，鸣笛鸣笛，冲向现场。病人被转移到五十年前百万富翁无法承受的医院环境。 “因此，务实和人道主义的态度发展的是技术，而不是逻辑论证。理性的道德态度能够培养哲学家和牧师，而不是技术。”
On September 17, 1934, Senator Reed of Missouri addressed the World’s Fair at Chicago:
1934 年 9 月 17 日，密苏里州参议员里德在芝加哥世界博览会上致辞：
The Bolshevist government declares that any person owning more than three cows is a capitalist and must surrender his surplus cows to the state. If he does not, the government takes them by force. The New Deal declares that if you have more than $100 in gold, and do not surrender it, you will be sent to the penitentiary. The injustice in each case is the same. [A is A.] The charge of grosser cruelty rests upon our government.
布尔什维克政府宣布，任何拥有三头以上奶牛的人都是资本家，必须将多余的奶牛交给国家。如果他不这样做，政府就会用武力夺走他们。新政宣布，如果你拥有超过100美元的黄金，并且不交出，你将被送进监狱。每种情况下的不公正都是一样的。 [A 是 A.] 我们的政府被指控犯有更严重的残忍行为。
This is a typical example of oratorical logic. You will find parallels in almost any newspaper. The Russian Soviet Government is identified with the United States Government, with no inquiry whatsoever into the context of the situation, into why the Russian Government did what it did, or why the American Government, under a vastly different set of circumstances, did what it did. The whole spurious verbal bundle is then tied up with emotional catchwords like “Bolshevist,” “grosser cruelty.”
这是演讲逻辑的典型例子。您几乎会在任何报纸上找到相似之处。俄罗斯苏维埃政府与美国政府等同，没有对当时的情况进行任何调查，也没有询问为什么俄罗斯政府做了它所做的事情，或者为什么美国政府在完全不同的情况下做了它所做的事情。做过。然后，整个虚假的词语与诸如“布尔什维主义”、“更加残酷”之类的情感流行语联系在一起。
Here is a line in space. A line by definition can be divided into two parts. Good, we will bisect it. Then we will take the right-hand half and bisect that, and the resulting half, and bisect that. How long can we continue to bisect the remaining segment? As something always remains, we can obviously continue forever. An infinite process. The logic, I take it, is faultless. Modern physicists, after barking their shins on such concepts overlong, have become exceedingly suspicious of “infinity.”
这是空间中的一条线。根据定义，一条线可以分为两部分。好，我们将其一分为二。然后我们将右半部分平分，然后将所得的一半平分。我们还能继续平分剩下的线段多久？由于某些东西永远存在，我们显然可以永远持续下去。一个无限的过程。我认为逻辑是完美的。现代物理学家在对这些概念大喊大叫之后，对“无穷大”变得极度怀疑。
Let us now start at the other end, the event end, and see what happens. Here is a thin stick of metal. We can continue bisecting it—if we are clever enough—until it reaches a length about a million times smaller than revealed by the most powerful microscope. At this point, we hit a single atom and a full stop. Division can go no further without changing the chemical nature of the stick. Lope, as practiced, often verbally divides what empirically cannot be divided.
现在让我们从另一端开始，即事件结束，看看会发生什么。这是一根细金属棒。如果我们足够聪明，我们可以继续将其一分为二，直到它的长度比最强大的显微镜所显示的长度小约一百万倍。此时，我们击中了一个原子并停止了。如果不改变棒的化学性质，分裂就无法进一步进行。按照惯例，洛佩经常口头上划分凭经验无法划分的东西。
Jumping from imaginary lines to souls, let us examine a favorite syllogism of theology.
让我们从想象的线条跳到灵魂，来考察神学中最喜欢的三段论。
Major premise: Sin must be harshly exorcised.
大前提：罪恶必须被严厉地驱除。
Minor premise: Man is conceived in sin.
小前提：人是在罪中孕育的。
Therefore: Man must be unhappy to be virtuous.
故曰：人必不乐而有德。
Over against the doctrine of original sin, Rousseau erected the doctrine of original virtue—the happy, “natural” man and his natural rights. Two bloody revolutions followed, the American and the French, in which men fought about slogans derived from Rousseau. Both doctrines are highly abstract, with referents difficult to locate. Both have been connected with much turmoil in human affairs.
卢梭反对原罪学说，建立了原初美德学说——幸福的、“自然的”人及其自然权利。随后发生了美国和法国的两次血腥革命，人们为源自卢梭的口号而战。这两种学说都非常抽象，很难找到所指的内容。两者都与人类事务中的许多动荡有关。
The notion of “original sin” is one of the most troublesome ever contrived. It assumes that men will get into mischief unless they are chronically unhappy, worked long hours, rigidly disciplined, and filled with a sense of inferiority. This is supposed to give them character. From the unverified premise emerges the ferocious dogma of hard work, the equally ferocious dogma of the character-building attributes of poverty and slum-dwelling, the fear of mass leisure, the fear of decent living-standards for all citizens, and indeed the persistence of the paradox of plenty. Influential people quake at the prospect of an ample living for all, because of their indoctrination with the logic of “original sin.” When this is combined with another logical monster which takes the form
“原罪”的概念是有史以来最麻烦的概念之一。它认为，除非男人长期不快乐、工作时间长、纪律严明、充满自卑感，否则他们就会陷入恶作剧。这应该赋予他们性格。从未经证实的前提中，出现了艰苦工作的残酷教条，贫困和贫民窟居住的品格塑造属性的同样残酷的教条，对大众休闲的恐惧，对所有公民体面生活水平的恐惧，以及事实上的坚持充足的悖论。有影响力的人们对所有人过上富裕生活的前景感到震惊，因为他们被灌输了“原罪”逻辑。当它与另一个采用以下形式的逻辑怪物结合时
The amount of wealth is a fixed sum.
财富的数额是固定的。
If the poor receive more wealth,
如果穷人获得更多的财富，
Then the rich will receive less,
那么富人得到的就会更少，
the difficulties in the path of those who seek to abolish poverty are manifest. Robinson says:
消除贫困道路上的困难是显而易见的。罗宾逊 说：
It is commonly supposed that the rackets of our great cities arise primarily out of that unpunished Sin which is abroad in the world. It is also supposed that these rackets can be eliminated if only the police could be stimulated and the petty courts purified. Such a theory is, of course, about as near to reality as other theories demanding the exorcising of evil spirits. . . . To admit that racketeers are symptoms rather than causes of a social evil, is more than most of us can stand.
人们普遍认为，我们大城市的喧嚣主要源于世界上未受惩罚的罪恶。人们还认为，只要能够激励警察并净化小法院，这些骗局就可以消除。当然，这样的理论与其他要求驱除邪灵的理论一样接近现实。 。 。 。承认敲诈勒索者只是社会罪恶的症状而不是根源，这让我们大多数人都无法忍受。
A considerable industry in the United States is the arrangement of public debates, with fees for attending the same so far as fees are collectible. The idea behind a debating contest is to combine disagreement with knowledge. To the student of semantics this is like combining beer and milk. Internal combustion is the most that can be expected. One is solemnly advised to “listen to both sides” and then make up his mind. As both sides are determined to use any means short of fisticuffs to make disagreement as wide as possible, and will indulge in most varieties of logic-chopping, double meanings, and verbal fraud to achieve this end, the listener, if he can make up his mind at all—a rare event—makes it on the basis of a gross distortion of the facts of the situation under discussion.
在美国，举办公开辩论是一个相当大的产业，只要可收取费用，参加辩论的费用是相同的。辩论比赛背后的想法是将分歧与知识结合起来。对于语义学的学生来说，这就像将啤酒和牛奶结合起来。内燃是最值得期待的。郑重建议“听取双方的意见”，然后再做出决定。由于双方都决心使用任何非拳脚相加的手段来尽可能扩大分歧，并且会沉迷于各种逻辑切割、双关语和言语欺诈来达到这一目的，听者如果可以弥补的话他的想法完全是基于对所讨论情况的事实的严重歪曲——这是罕见的事件。
If the subject be “Resolved: That hockey is a better game than cricket,” no great harm is done. The question is meaningless to begin with, and the uproar may be entertaining. But if it be “Resolved: That government ownership is a failure,” then the debate becomes pernicious by choking the listeners or readers with verbal poison gas—sprayed from both sides, mind you. I can think of nothing more antieducational. I have taken part in a few formal debates in the past, and hereby apologize for the confusion which I may have spread.
如果主题是“已解决：曲棍球比板球更好”，也不会造成太大伤害。这个问题本来就毫无意义，而引起的骚动可能很有趣。但如果它是“解决：政府所有权是失败的”，那么这场辩论就会变得有害，因为言语毒气让听众或读者窒息——请注意，双方都喷洒了毒气。我想不出还有什么比这更反教育的了。我过去参加过几次正式辩论，特此为我可能造成的混乱表示歉意。
When we employ formal logic, we work on the left side of the triangle and avoid the task of finding referents for out talk. Knowledge of the world about us is not advanced in such a verbal treadmill. Francis Bacon summed it up three centuries ago:
当我们使用形式逻辑时，我们在三角形的左侧工作，避免了为谈话寻找指称的任务。在这样的言语跑步机上，我们对周围世界的了解并不深入。弗朗西斯·培根三个世纪前总结道：
It cannot be that axioms established by argumentation can suffice for the discovery of new works, since the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument.
通过论证建立的公理不可能足以发现新的作品，因为自然的微妙性比论证的微妙性高出许多倍。
END OF PHILOSOPHERS’ WALK
哲学家之路的终点
The classical philosophies place on the table, as it were, a misty sphere of pure nothingness, labeled “the Good,” “the Nominal,” “the Principle of Heaviness,” or “the Oversoul.” Ah, here is a fascinating puzzle, what does “Oversoul” mean? Presently they are juggling a circusful of metaphysical balls, one rolling and dissolving into the next, and classifying them with meticulous logic. But they have started the exhibit from the wrong end, trying to work down from abstractions rather than up from tangible events. We have been cursed with this wrong-endedness for twenty-five centuries.
古典哲学在桌子上放置了一个纯粹虚无的迷雾球体，被贴上“善”、“名义”、“沉重原理”或“超灵”的标签。啊，这是一个令人着迷的谜题，“超灵”是什么意思？目前，他们正在玩弄一系列形而上学的球，一个滚动又溶解到另一个球中，并以细致的逻辑对它们进行分类。但他们从错误的一端开始展览，试图从抽象的东西开始，而不是从有形的事件开始。二十五个世纪以来，我们一直被这种错误的结局所诅咒。
Plato condemned the logic of the Sophists as a sham. Aristotle convicted the Dialectic of Plato of formal inability to yield a demonstration. Bacon denounced the sterility of Aristotle’s formal demonstration. Mill deplored the inadequacy of the Baconian induction method. The critics of Mill showed that his induction technique was as formal and as futile as anything hitherto attempted. Locke demolished Edward Herbert. Hume demolished Locke. Morris Cohen demolishes Hume, J. E. Boodin demolishes Descartes. Modern philosophers wipe their boots on Kant and Herbert Spencer. John Dewey makes mincemeat of his forerunners. Bright postgraduates in Columbia, Harvard, and Chicago are now busily engaged in dismembering Dewey. Nominalism rolls into Realism into Materialism and back to Romanticism round the corner to Idealism to stub its toe on Positivism and return again to Humanism.
柏拉图谴责诡辩家的逻辑是骗局。亚里士多德认为柏拉图的辩证法在形式上无法产生论证。培根谴责亚里士多德的形式论证毫无结果。密尔对培根归纳法的不足表示遗憾。密尔的批评者表明，他的归纳法与迄今为止所尝试的任何方法一样形式化且徒劳。洛克推翻了爱德华·赫伯特。休谟推翻了洛克。莫里斯·科恩推翻了休谟，J·E·布丁推翻了笛卡尔。现代哲学家向康德和赫伯特·斯宾塞擦鞋。约翰·杜威把他的前辈们糟蹋了。哥伦比亚大学、哈佛大学和芝加哥大学的聪明研究生现在正忙着肢解杜威。唯名论卷入现实主义，进入唯物主义，又回到浪漫主义，转而转入唯心主义，触碰实证主义，再次回到人文主义。
In brief, the boys do not seem to be making much progress. Dewey mournfully remarks, “A certain tragic fate seems to attend all intellectual movements.” With no standard, no proof, anywhere in the premises, a brand of philosophy can be overthrown as easily as it can rise up. Said Thomas Huxley:
简而言之，男孩们似乎并没有取得太大进步。杜威悲伤地说：“所有的知识分子运动似乎都伴随着某种悲惨的命运。”没有标准，没有证据，无论在任何地方，一个哲学品牌都可以很容易地被推翻，也可以很容易地兴起。托马斯·赫胥黎说：
Generation after generation, philosophy has been doomed to roll the stone uphill; and just as all the world swore it was at the top, down ic has rolled to the bottom again . . . until now the weight and the number of those who refuse to be the prey of verbal mystifications has begun to tell in practical life.
一代又一代，哲学注定是把石头推上山。就在全世界都发誓已经到达顶峰的时候，IC又滚到了底部。 。 。到目前为止，那些拒绝成为口头神秘主义牺牲品的人的分量和数量已经开始在现实生活中显现出来。
Huxley’s grandson, Aldous, observes that philosophical arguments are mostly angry shoutings at one another by two people who use the same words but mean different things by them.
赫胥黎的孙子奥尔德斯观察到，哲学论证大多是两个使用相同词语但含义不同的人互相愤怒的叫喊。
Language as it has developed seems to be expressly designed to mislead philosophers. Or have the philosophers also been instrumental in misleading language? Admirers of philosophy and formal logic evidently regard abstractions as real things. Somehow they personify and identify terms for which referents are unreported. Such students can even agree about some meanings, for a limited period of time, before the inevitable wrangle develops. But the process is obviously inside their heads, and there insulated.
语言的发展似乎是专门为了误导哲学家而设计的。或者哲学家们是否也在误导性语言中发挥了作用？哲学和形式逻辑的崇拜者显然将抽象视为真实的事物。它们以某种方式拟人化并识别未报告的所指对象的术语。在不可避免的争论发生之前，这些学生甚至可以在有限的时间内就某些含义达成一致。但这个过程显然是在他们的脑子里，而且是绝缘的。
Henshaw Ward points an instructive contrast between Scholasticism and science:
汉肖·沃德 (Henshaw Ward) 指出了经院哲学与科学之间的一个富有启发性的对比：
Playing with words Observing facts
玩文字游戏 观察事实
Disease is caused by sin. Many diseases are caused by submicroscopic organisms, some by visible bacteria and by mosquitoes.
疾病是由罪引起的。许多疾病是由亚微观生物引起的，有些是由可见细菌和蚊子引起的。
Numbers rule the heavenly bodies and determine human fate. Numbers are orderly relation series evolved by the human mind.
数字统治着天体，决定着人类的命运。数字是人类思维演化出来的有序关系系列。
Stars are personalities controlling human destiny. All observable motions of stars could be accounted for by supposing that the earth revolves around the sun.
明星是掌控人类命运的人物。所有可观测到的恒星运动都可以通过假设地球绕太阳旋转来解释。
Fossils were made by Satan to deceive men and cause them to lose their souls by reasoning irreligiously. Fossils are a guide to the history of the earth.
化石是撒但制造的，目的是为了迷惑人，使人因非宗教的推理而失去灵魂。化石是地球历史的指南。
Knowledge is that which seems best to my own mind. The clue to knowledge is the agreement of competent observers.
知识是我自己认为最好的知识。知识的线索是有能力的观察者的同意。
The philosophers, then, have persistently overthrown one another down the ages. This observation will be promptly seized upon by an enterprising logician in the following form:
因此，历代以来，哲学家们不断地相互推翻。一位有进取心的逻辑学家将立即以以下形式抓住这一观察结果：
Major premise: All intellectual theories are fallacious.
大前提：所有理智理论都是错误的。
Minor premise: Semantics is an intellectual theory.
小前提：语义学是一种智力理论。
Therefore: Semantics is fallacious.
因此：语义学是错误的。
If semantics is but another game with words as counters, the syllogism is irrefutable. If it turns out to be a discipline connecting with tangible referents, a discipline which can be checked and rechecked by experiment, and upon which sane men can agree, it moves out of the dusty area of dialectic to become an instrument of permanent usefulness to mankind.
如果语义学不过是另一种以文字为筹码的游戏，那么三段论就是无可辩驳的。如果它被证明是一门与有形指称相联系的学科，一门可以通过实验检验和复检验的学科，并且得到理智的人的认可，那么它就会走出辩证法的尘土飞扬的领域，成为对人类永久有用的工具。 。
Chapter XIV
第十四章
TO THE RIGHT WITH THE ECONOMISTS
与经济学家一起走向右翼
CLASSICAL philosophy does not yield a helpful method of obtaining information about the world outside. Classical economics does not yield a helpful method of explaining how men acquire food, clothing, and shelter. Initially, one expects better results from economics, because it deals with homely things like wheat, onions, and parlor furniture. It wastes little effort in tracking down the Good, the True, and the Beautiful. But on closer examination it appears that unwarranted identifications and high-order abstractions run riot here, as in philosophy. Just because it seems to be a more practical study, the results are perhaps even more lamentable.
古典哲学并没有提供一种获取外部世界信息的有用方法。古典经济学并没有提供一种有用的方法来解释人们如何获得食物、衣服和住所。最初，人们期望经济学能带来更好的结果，因为它涉及小麦、洋葱和客厅家具等家常事物。它不费吹灰之力去追寻善、真、美。但仔细观察就会发现，毫无根据的认同和高阶抽象在这里泛滥成灾，就像在哲学中一样。正因为这看起来是一项更实际的研究，结果也许更令人遗憾。
Says Hogben in this connection:
霍格本就此说道：
Instead of inventing a scientific nomenclature free from extraneous associations, economics, like theology, borrows its terms from common speech, defines them in a sense different from and often opposite to their accepted meaning, erects a stone wall of logic on concealed verbal foundations, and defies the plain man to scale it. The part of the real world with which economics is concerned is bounded above and below by the two covers of the dictionary.
经济学不像神学那样发明一种没有外来关联的科学术语，而是从日常言语中借用术语，以不同于甚至与其公认含义相反的方式来定义它们，在隐藏的语言基础上竖起逻辑的石墙，普通人无法攀登它。经济学所涉及的现实世界部分由字典的两个封面上下界定。
Hogben finds a sample in the works of Professor L. C. Robbins of the London School of Economics. Robbins states the “law” of supply and demand as a well-known generalization of price theory. When some outside body fixes a price below the market price, demand will exceed supply. Robbins then asks upon what foundations this statement rests. Not upon any appeal to history, he says. Not upon the results of controlled experiment. “In the last analysis our proposition rests upon deductions which are implicit in our initial definition of the subject matter of economic science.”
霍格本在伦敦经济学院 LC 罗宾斯教授的著作中找到了一个样本。罗宾斯将供需“定律”表述为众所周知的价格理论概括。当某些外部机构将价格定为低于市场价格时，需求将超过供应。罗宾斯随后询问这一说法的基础是什么。他说，这并不是基于对历史的任何诉求。不是基于对照实验的结果。 “归根结底，我们的命题基于隐含在我们对经济科学主题的最初定义中的推论。”
Hogben, the biologist, is scandalized. Such stuff, he says, is the astrology of the Power Age. The law of supply and demand rests on a manipulation of words rather than on verified observation. The process is like a game of chess which depends on knowing the initial definition of the moves.
生物学家霍格本感到震惊。他说，这些东西就是电力时代的占星学。供给和需求的规律依赖于文字的操纵，而不是基于经过验证的观察。这个过程就像一盘国际象棋，取决于对动作的初始定义。
A subject which admits to the dignity of law, statements solely based on logical manipulation of verbal assertions forfeits any right to be regarded as a science. In science the final arbiter is not the self-evidence of the initial statement, nor the façade of flawless logic which conceals it.
作为一个承认法律尊严的学科，仅仅基于对口头断言的逻辑操纵的陈述就丧失了被视为科学的任何权利。在科学中，最终的仲裁者不是最初陈述的不证自明，也不是隐藏它的完美逻辑的外表。
Final validity in science rests on doing, on performing an operation, not on talking.
科学的最终有效性取决于行动、执行操作，而不是空谈。
A semantic analysis of economic theory would fill a book in itself. It would be a volume both instructive and depressing. Here we have space but for a few examples. The economists are as far from agreement among themselves as are the philosophers. This strongly suggests that extrapolation and shaky assumptions dominate the field, with the scientific method undeveloped. It is a safe rule that any study where students cannot agree upon what they are talking about is outside the scientific discipline.
对经济理论的语义分析本身就可以写满一本书。这将是一本既有启发性又令人沮丧的书。这里我们有足够的空间举几个例子。经济学家们与哲学家们一样，彼此之间的意见也相去甚远。这强烈表明，外推法和不稳定的假设在该领域占主导地位，科学方法尚未开发。一条安全的规则是，任何学生无法就他们所讨论的内容达成一致的研究都属于科学学科之外。
I employ a skilled mechanic to mow my meadow and cultivate my garden. He used to be employed in a Connecticut mill, but a new machine was installed and he and some others lost their work. So he is keeping himself and his family alive as best he can at a fraction of his former income. He was a victim of what is termed “technological unemployment.” A machine took his work from him, and for a considerable period he could find no other work to do. He might have left town, but he had bought a house, his children were in school, his wife liked the neighborhood, and to take to the road was a risky venture with machinists out of work on every hand. Now what do the classical economists do with my friend Roy Thompson?
我聘请了一位熟练的机械师来修剪我的草地并耕种我的花园。他曾经受雇于康涅狄格州的一家工厂，但安装了一台新机器，他和其他一些人失去了工作。因此，他用以前收入的一小部分来尽最大努力维持自己和家人的生活。他是所谓“技术性失业”的受害者。一台机器夺走了他的工作，在相当长的一段时间内他找不到其他工作可做。他可能已经离开了城镇，但他已经买了房子，他的孩子们正在上学，他的妻子喜欢这个社区，而上路是一项冒险的冒险，因为机械师们都失业了。现在古典经济学家对我的朋友罗伊·汤普森做了什么？
They prove by irrefutable logic that technological unemployment is impossible. I know what I am saying, for I have debated the matter in public with classical economists and can tick off the arguments with my eyes shut. The logic proceeds like this: A new machine is put into a pin factory to take the place of men. The cost of making pins is lowered. Presently competition lowers the price of pins as the machine is generally adopted. Therefore housewives spend less money for pins and have more money to spend for silk stockings. Therefore the factories making stockings employ more help, and no unemployment results. On the other hand, if the first factory has a monopoly of the new machine, and does not choose to lower the price of pins, the owner of the factory takes in more money. This money he either spends, let us say for a private airplane, or invests in a new pin factory. Workers have to build the airplane or the factory, giving more employment. On purely logical grounds, you cannot get around it. Employment shifts, but does not decline and the same amount of money continues in circulation. Q.E.D.
他们以无可辩驳的逻辑证明，技术性失业是不可能的。我知道我在说什么，因为我曾在公开场合与古典经济学家争论过这个问题，并且闭着眼睛也能把这些争论勾出来。逻辑是这样的：在一家别针工厂里投入一台新机器来代替人类。制造销钉的成本降低。目前，随着机器的普遍采用，竞争降低了销钉的价格。因此，家庭主妇买别针的钱少了，买丝袜的钱多了。因此，制造丝袜的工厂雇佣了更多的人帮忙，并没有造成失业的结果。另一方面，如果第一家工厂垄断了新机器，并且不选择降低销钉的价格，那么工厂的老板就会赚到更多的钱。他要么花这笔钱，比如购买一架私人飞机，要么投资一家新的别针工厂。工人们必须建造飞机或工厂，提供更多就业机会。纯粹从逻辑上讲，你无法绕过它。就业发生变化，但并未减少，同样数量的货币继续流通。量子电动力学
How do you get around it? You look steadily at Roy Thompson, at scores of still less fortunate Roy Thompsons. You adopt the operational approach, disregard the logic in your head, and observe what is happening outside. You are careful not to generalize from one or two cases. In the world of fact, you find that men and women frequently lose their jobs to machines, to stop-watch efficiency methods, to photoelectric cells, to improvements in agricultural methods. You can count them if you have the heart, leaving their benches and their tools and going out upon the street. You can examine the curves of output per man-hour for this commodity and that and note how they have been rising for fifty years. You can halt any workingman and ask him to tell you how he or his friends have lost their work from time to time because of new inventions.
你如何解决这个问题？你盯着罗伊·汤普森，看着许多更不幸的罗伊·汤普森。你采取操作性的方法，忽略头脑中的逻辑，观察外面发生的事情。你要小心，不要从一两个案例中得出结论。在现实世界中，你会发现男人和女人经常因为机器、秒表效率方法、光电电池、农业方法的改进而失去工作。如果你有心，你可以数一数他们，留下他们的长凳和工具，到街上去。您可以检查这种商品和那种商品的每工时产量曲线，并注意它们在五十年来是如何增长的。你可以叫住任何一个工人，让他告诉你他或他的朋友是如何时常因为新发明而失去工作的。
It is not hard to check and recheck the facts of technological unemployment. Referents for the term are very plentiful. Very good—or rather, very bad. Millions of Roys have suffered for a greater or lesser period. Do they find other work? Many of them do. Often, like Roy, they learn new trades at inferior pay. But the increasing obstinacy of unemployment in the modern world indicates that many do not. Whether they do or do not, certain relevant human factors must be brought into the concept. Can Roy1 after twenty years of working at a lathe shift his skill to qualify as a linesman if men are wanted in that field? Can Roy2 after living forty years in Middletown with his roots driven deep pick up his family and move to Seattle if men are wanted on the docks? Can Roy3, now unemployed, hibernate like a woodchuck and live without eating because a year hence there is to be a demand for machinists in the television industry? Can Roy4 change from man’s work in a machine shop to woman’s work in a rayon factory? What kind of employment awaits him? Where does it await him? When does it await him?
检验和再检验技术性失业的事实并不难。该术语的参考文献非常丰富。非常好——或者更确切地说，非常糟糕。数以百万计的罗伊人或多或少地遭受了痛苦。他们找到其他工作了吗？他们中的许多人都这样做。通常，像罗伊一样，他们以较低的工资学习新的行业。但现代世界日益严重的失业现象表明，许多人并不这样做。无论他们这样做或不这样做，某些相关的人为因素都必须纳入这个概念中。如果罗伊在车床上工作了二十年，如果该领域需要人才，他能否将他的技能转变为合格的线工？如果码头上需要男人，罗伊在米德尔敦生活了四十年，根深蒂固，他能带着家人搬到西雅图吗？现在失业的罗伊3能否像土拨鼠一样冬眠，不吃东西过日子，因为一年后电视行业需要机械师？ Roy4 能否将男性在机械车间的工作转变为女性在人造丝工厂的工作？什么样的工作在等待着他？哪里等着他呢？等待他的是什么时候？
It is two very different things to talk about “technological unemployment” as a net statistical effect and to observe Roy in his perplexity and discouragement. If new invention speeds up, it is obvious that more men and women per thousand are in transit from a job lost to a job hopefully to be found. And what happens if the owner of the factory does not care to buy a private airplane or to invest in a new pin plant? Suppose he just puts his money in the bank, and the bank just lets it stay there? For the last eight years new investments in private industry have been pitifully small compared with earlier periods. What if we have as many pin factories as prospects for profitable investment wartant?
将“技术性失业”作为净统计效应来谈论，与观察罗伊的困惑和沮丧是两件截然不同的事情。如果新发明的速度加快，很明显，每千人中会有更多的男性和女性从失去的工作转向有望找到的工作。如果工厂老板不愿意购买私人飞机或投资新的销钉工厂，会发生什么？假设他只是把钱存入银行，而银行就让钱留在那里呢？过去八年来，私营企业的新增投资与之前相比少得可怜。如果我们拥有与有利可图的投资前景一样多的别针工厂怎么办？
These considerations by no means exhaust the question. But perhaps I have given enough to show that knowledge about technological unemployment, or indeed any kind of employment, is not advanced by the syllogisms of classical economists. The classicists treat the term as a thing-in-itself without finding the referents which give it meaning. Most characteristics are Lit out. Observe the brutality of the result. If one can prove by logic that there can be no such thing as technological unemployment, then any apparent idleness must be due to human cussedness—Roy must have been a slack worker, improvident and wrong-headed—and one can lean comfortably back in his chair with no need to do anything about it. More, one can violently object to anybody’s doing anything about it, for this would interfere with the functioning of “economic law.”
这些考虑因素决不能穷尽问题。但也许我已经给出了足够的证据来表明，关于技术性失业，或者实际上任何类型的就业的知识，并不是古典经济学家的三段论所提出的。古典主义者将这个术语视为自在之物，而没有找到赋予它意义的所指对象。大多数特性都被点亮。观察结果的残酷性。如果一个人能用逻辑证明不存在技术性失业这样的事情，那么任何明显的闲散必定是由于人类的粗俗造成的——罗伊一定是一个懒惰的工人，缺乏远见和错误的头脑——人们可以舒适地靠在他的床上。椅子，无需做任何事情。此外，人们可以强烈反对任何人对此采取的任何行动，因为这会干扰“经济法”的运作。
“Unemployment” is not a thing. You cannot prove its existence or nonexistence except as a word. The validity of the concept rests on the shoulders of millions of your fellow citizens. Are they suffering because they have no work? Are their families suffering? Are the children without shoes with which to go to school? In March, 1937, I visited WPA kitchens in Savannah, Georgia, where 4,500 schoolchildren, certified as underweight from malnutrition, were being fed. Savannah is neither a large city nor a city of slums. If you cannot see through the word “unemployment” to ragged children standing patiently in line with bowl and spoon, you have no business hanging out your shingle as an economist.
“失业”不是一个问题。除了作为一个词之外，你无法证明它的存在或不存在。这一概念的有效性取决于数百万同胞的肩上。他们是否因为没有工作而受苦？他们的家人正在受苦吗？孩子们没有鞋子去上学吗？ 1937 年 3 月，我参观了佐治亚州萨凡纳的 WPA 厨房，那里有 4,500 名因营养不良而被证明体重过轻的学童正在吃东西。萨凡纳既不是大城市，也不是贫民窟城市。如果你无法看穿拿着碗和勺子耐心排队的衣衫褴褛的孩子们的“失业”这个词，那么你就没有资格挂出你作为经济学家的招牌。
Let us inspect another favorite abstraction of the economic faculty: “The function of business is to supply the consumer with what he wants.” Translating this to lower levels: The function of the radio business is to supply Adam1 with a serviceable radio at a price consistent with the cost of producing it. In the fall of 1936, a leading radio trade journal made the following editorial comment:
让我们考察一下经济学界另一个最喜欢的抽象概念：“企业的功能是为消费者提供他想要的东西。”换言之：无线电业务的功能是以与生产成本一致的价格向 Adam1 提供可用的无线电。 1936 年秋天，一家领先的无线电行业杂志发表了以下社论评论：
The ear of the average consumer is notoriously cauliflower when it comes to distinguishing between good radio reception and bad. Since original boom-boom dynamic speakers superseded early high-pitched magnetics, few improvements impinging upon the auditory organs have been sufficiently obvious to nudge obsolete receivers into oblivion without the aid of vocal mesmerisms by some retail salesman. The public eye, on the other hand, appears to be readily impressed, and we predict the best year since 1929. Design for selling.
众所周知，普通消费者的耳朵在区分无线电接收效果好坏方面就像菜花一样。自从最初的动圈式扬声器取代了早期的高音调磁性扬声器以来，对听觉器官的影响几乎没有什么改进能够足够明显地推动过时的接收器被遗忘，而不需要一些零售推销员声音催眠的帮助。另一方面，公众的目光似乎很容易被打动，我们预测这是自 1929 年以来最好的一年。为销售而设计。
In short, do not build radios for the ear, because there have been no recent improvements to warrant new models; build them to sell an elegant Circassian walnut cabinet. Here are some assorted vocal mesmerisms:
简而言之，不要为耳朵制造收音机，因为最近没有改进来保证新型号；建造它们来销售优雅的切尔克斯胡桃木橱柜。以下是一些各种各样的声音催眠术：
Band-Stand Baffles Overtone Amplifiers
乐队支架挡板泛音放大器
Tone-Tested Resonators Acoustical Labyrinths
经过音调测试的谐振器声学迷宫
Violin-Shaped Cabinets Magic Voice
小提琴形音箱 魔声
Vibracoustic Floating Sound Boards Mystic Hand
Vibracoustic 浮动音板 Mystic Hand
Automatic Flash Tuner Dial-a-matic
自动闪光调谐器 Dial-a-matic
What the radio industry does in the economic textbooks is one thing; what it actually does is another. The observation holds for most industries which can make more goods in a year than people buy in a year, or in more learned language, where capacity exceeds demand.
广播行业在经济教科书中所做的事情是一回事；另一回事是另一回事。它实际上做的是另一回事。这一观察结果适用于大多数行业，这些行业一年生产的商品数量多于人们一年购买的商品数量，或者用更专业的语言来说，产能超过需求。
What a remarkable term is “business,” especially in America! How is business?—not your business, but business-in-general. Statisticians toil over composite graphs and charts to answer this mythological question. If there is no such entity as “business”—and by now we know there is not—it seems a little superfluous to be constantly taking its temperature. Business says. Business speaks. Business recovers its voice. Business views with alarm. Business is jubilant when the Supreme Court votes down the NRA. Business is sick. Business is terrible. Business runs through a cycle—charming image. Business has recovered: Look at the chart—there it is, as plain as the nose on your face. Back to 1929. The curve says we are all right, therefore we must be all right. What, eight million unemployed; farmers in the Dust Bowl down and out; share-croppers reach new depths of misery? Forget it. Keep your eye on the chart.
“商业”是一个多么了不起的词，尤其是在美国！生意怎么样？——不是你的事，而是一般的生意。统计学家辛勤地研究复合图表来回答这个神话问题。如果不存在“商业”这样的实体——现在我们知道不存在——那么不断地测量它的温度似乎有点多余。生意说。生意说话。商业恢复了声音。带警报的业务视图。当最高法院否决全国步枪协会时，商界一片欢欣鼓舞。生意有病。生意很糟糕。商业运行有一个循环——迷人的形象。业务已经恢复：看看图表——它就在那里，就像你脸上的鼻子一样简单。回到 1929 年。曲线表明我们一切都好，因此我们一定一切都好。什么，八百万失业者；农民在沙尘暴中落魄；佃农的苦难又达到了新的深度吗？忘了它。请密切关注图表。
This is pure hocus-pocus. Not only are there no dependable referents to which we can hitch the chart, but those to which it has been hitched—“carloadings,” “bank loans,” “lumber production,” “cotton-mill consumption”—cannot be combined into any composite curve which does not violate mathematical sanity. A great mathematician, Ivar Fredholm, calls such omnibus index numbers “hermaphrodite arithmetic monsters devoid of all sense.” At this point we note a curious perversion of the scientific attitude. Opinions as to the health of “business” are based on figures, rather than on hearsay and hunches. We are looking, we believe, at cold facts. We are scientific as hell. But the “facts and figures” we look at have been mutilated beyond meaning. Some day we must give up prostrations before a phantom “business,” though the charts reach from Wall Street to the moon. The term “business,” and its faithful follower “service,” often prevent us from observing what useful or useless things businessmen are actually doing.
这纯粹是骗人的把戏。我们不仅没有可以将图表挂在图表上的可靠参考对象，而且图表所挂接的对象——“装车量”、“银行贷款”、“木材生产”、“棉纺厂消费”——也无法组合成任何数据。不违反数学理智的复合曲线。伟大的数学家伊瓦尔·弗雷德霍姆 (Ivar Fredholm) 将此类综合索引数字称为“缺乏任何意义的雌雄同体的算术怪物”。在这一点上，我们注意到对科学态度的一种奇怪的曲解。对“商业”健康状况的看法是基于数据，而不是道听途说和预感。我们相信，我们正在寻找冷酷的事实。我们是科学的。但我们所看到的“事实和数据”已经被肢解得毫无意义。总有一天，我们必须放弃对幻影“生意”的屈服，尽管图表从华尔街延伸到月球。 “商业”一词及其忠实追随者“服务”常常使我们无法观察商人实际上在做什么有用或无用的事情。
Many economists and statisticians believe it legitimate to argue that industrial prosperity after a slump will inevitably return, because their charts show ups and downs in the past. They point to the scientific nature of the “proof.” But the graphs a real scientist draws describe the conditions of an experiment arranged by him. They can be used safely for drawing conclusions only if similar conditions can be arranged. The humps and hollows on the economists’ charts refer to changing conditions. There is no similar arrangement, and few valid conclusions are possible. The context has changed, and the result must be guesswork. “Introducing graphs of supply and demand,” says Hogben, “in a fictitious free-exchange economy does not make economics an exact science.”
许多经济学家和统计学家认为，工业衰退后的繁荣将不可避免地回归是合理的，因为他们的图表显示了过去的起伏。他们指出了“证据”的科学性。但真正的科学家绘制的图表描述的是他安排的实验条件。只有在能够安排类似的条件的情况下，它们才可以安全地用于得出结论。经济学家图表上的隆起和凹陷指的是不断变化的条件。没有类似的安排，几乎不可能得出有效的结论。背景已经改变，结果一定是猜测。霍格本说：“在虚构的自由交换经济中引入供需图表并不能使经济学成为一门精确的科学。”
A business executive with whom I am associated asked me the other day, “What will be the reaction of the public to the new laws for resale price maintenance?” This was an important question, for as manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer of a commodity he had to decide a policy covering costs, prices, possible injunctions, court orders, notification to retailers, and so on. Yet my colleague was trying to settle this critical matter with the aid of a ghost. There is no “public” which is a useful concept in the premises. Calling it “John Q. Public” does not help. Between us, we had to break down “public” into a series of interested groups—New York retailers, retailers in the West, jobbing houses, customers of various kinds—before we could know what we were talking about and arrive at a valid decision. Observe that in this case no theory was involved. As businessmen, we had to determine, by the following Saturday morning, a specific course of action involving the stability and the jobs of a considerable business enterprise.
与我有联系的一位企业高管前几天问我：“公众对维持转售价格的新法律有何反应？”这是一个重要的问题，因为作为商品的制造商、批发商和零售商，他必须决定一项涵盖成本、价格、可能的禁令、法院命令、零售商通知等的政策。然而我的同事却试图在鬼魂的帮助下解决这个关键问题。这里没有“公共”，这是一个有用的概念。称其为“John Q. Public”并没有什么帮助。在我们之间，我们必须将“公众”分解为一系列感兴趣的群体——纽约零售商、西方零售商、求职公司、各种客户——然后才能知道我们在谈论什么并做出有效的决定。请注意，在这种情况下没有涉及任何理论。作为商人，我们必须在接下来的星期六早上之前确定涉及一家大型企业的稳定和就业的具体行动方针。

回报
Some of these terms are useful short cuts provided one does not objectify them. But if one employs them without being conscious of abstracting, they acquire a fictitious existence. Some have no discoverable referents. “Value,” for instance, is as elusive as “the Omnipotent.” Some have referents very difficult to locate: “capitalism,” “individualism,” “inflation,” “credit,” “money,” “business.” Some have referents easier to locate, provided one makes the rare effort to find them.
其中一些术语是有用的捷径，只要不将它们具体化即可。但如果一个人在没有意识到抽象的情况下使用它们，它们就会获得一种虚构的存在。有些没有可发现的参照物。例如，“价值”就像“全能者”一样难以捉摸。有些很难找到指称：“资本主义”、“个人主义”、“通货膨胀”、“信贷”、“金钱”、“商业”。有些所指对象更容易找到，只要人们付出很少的努力就能找到它们。
Following Bridgman, we might prepare a list of meaningless questions in economics:
效仿布里奇曼，我们可以准备一系列毫无意义的经济学问题：
Does capital produce wealth?
资本能产生财富吗？
Is the consumer more important than the producer?
消费者比生产者更重要吗？
What is a reasonable profit?
什么是合理利润？
Is man by nature co-operative or competitive?
人的本性是合作性的还是竞争性的？
Is fascism a kind of capitalism?
法西斯主义是资本主义的一种吗？
What is a classless society?
什么是无阶级社会？
What is the American standard of living?
美国的生活水平是多少？
Are capital and labor partners?
资本和劳力是伙伴吗？
Are we headed for inflation?
我们正在走向通货膨胀吗？
Is decentralization better than centralization?
去中心化比集中化好吗？
These questions are either completely meaningless, 01 meaningless as they stand. Given a position in time and space, with further description of the terms employed, qualified answers might be found for some. For instance, Margaret Mead studied a tribe in New Guinea where habits of co-operation were very strong. A hundred miles over the mountains she studied another tribe where competition was so ferocious that it threatened survival. On the basis of these observations we might venture a qualified answer to question 4. For question 8, one can say that capital and labor are partners in the same sense that Castor and Pollux are brothers—mythological matters, both.
这些问题要么完全没有意义，01 就其本身而言毫无意义。给定时间和空间的位置，通过对所使用术语的进一步描述，可能会为某些人找到合格的答案。例如，玛格丽特·米德研究了新几内亚的一个部落，那里的合作习惯非常强烈。越过山脉一百英里，她研究了另一个部落，那里的竞争非常激烈，以至于威胁到生存。基于这些观察，我们可以大胆地对问题 4 给出一个合格的答案。对于问题 8，我们可以说资本和劳动力是伙伴，就像卡斯托尔和波勒克斯是兄弟一样——都是神话问题。
Korzybski observes that any study to become a science must begin with the lowest abstractions available, which means descriptions of happenings on the level of sense impressions. Economic literature usually reverses this procedure, starting with high-order terms and working down. Thus you will find in Chapter 1 of Dr. Blank’s Principles of Economics elaborate definitions of “land,” “labor,” “capital,” “wealth,” “profit,” “money,” “credit,” “property,” “marginal utility.” As any two economists have great difficulty in agreeing upon the precise meaning of these terms, the treatise begins with shaky assumptions. Worse follows when the shaky assumptions are woven into elaborate systems by deductive logic. The best fun which a professor of economics apparently gets out of his academic life is to demolish the theories of his confreres. The single time to my knowledge that American economists were in general agreement was when they objected to the Smoot-Hawley tariff bill in 1930, by a joint memorandum of more than a thousand signers. That was a red-letter day in the history of economic thought.
科日布斯基指出，任何要成为一门科学的研究都必须从最低的抽象开始，这意味着在感官印象层面上对发生的事情进行描述。经济学文献通常会颠倒这个过程，从高阶项开始，然后向下进行。因此，你会在布兰克博士的《经济学原理》第一章中找到对“土地”、“劳动力”、“资本”、“财富”、“利润”、“货币”、“信贷”、“财产”、“边际效用。”由于任何两位经济学家都很难就这些术语的确切含义达成一致，因此本文以不可靠的假设开始。当通过演绎逻辑将不稳定的假设编织成复杂的系统时，更糟糕的事情随之而来。经济学教授从学术生活中获得的最大乐趣显然就是推翻他的同事的理论。据我所知，美国经济学家唯一一次达成普遍共识是在 1930 年，他们通过一份由一千多名签署者联合签署的备忘录反对《斯穆特-霍利关税法案》。那是经济思想史上的一个重要日子。
To extend agreement and make the study of economics conform to the scientific method, it is necessary to lay aside abstract definitions and apply the operational approach. What is Rufus1 doing on his farm? What is Roy1 doing at his factory bench? What is Junius1 doing in his bank? (A bank studied on the basis of what is going on inside without recourse to abstractions like “credit,” “liquidity,” “soundness,” is a pretty whimsical thing.) What is Sylvia1 doing at her desk? Observe and record what a great number of men and women are actually doing in furnishing themselves and the community with food, clothing, and shelter. Then proceed to inferences. Then proceed to general rules governing economic behavior—if any can be found. Then check the rules with more firsthand observation. Never forget Adam1 acting, the date at which he acts, the place where he acts. Fortunately some economists and sociologists are beginning to follow this program. We find it in the studies of Middletown by the Lynds, in Ogburn’s Social Change, in Economic Behavior and Recent Social Trends, in the studies of the National Resources Committee.
要扩大共识，使经济学研究符合科学方法，就必须抛开抽象的定义，运用操作性的方法。 Rufus1 在他的农场做什么？ Roy1 在工厂的工作台上做什么？ Junius1 在他的银行做什么？ （银行根据内部情况进行研究，而不求助于“信用”、“流动性”、“稳健性”等抽象概念，这是一件非常异想天开的事情。） Sylvia1 在办公桌前做什么？观察并记录大量的男人和女人在为自己和社区提供食物、衣服和住所方面实际上做了什么。然后继续推理。然后继续讨论管理经济行为的一般规则——如果可以找到的话。然后通过更多的第一手观察来检查规则。永远不要忘记亚当的行动，他行动的日期，他行动的地点。幸运的是，一些经济学家和社会学家开始遵循这一计划。我们在林德夫妇对米德尔敦的研究、奥格本的社会变革、经济行为和近期社会趋势以及国家资源委员会的研究中发现了这一点。
Inferences drawn by Adam Smith about the England of 1770, or by Karl Marx about the England, France, and Germany of the 1850’s, are obviously worthless for the America of today. Some deductions may still be sound, but all are suspect pending operational check in modern America. To criticize American economic behavior today, or to prescribe for its improvement because Adam Smith said thus and Marx said so, is as foolish as believing that a fly has eight legs because Aristotle said so. Both Smith and Marx used their eyes and ears more than their fellow theorists. Ricardo, for instance, might have been born blind, so pure a theorist was he.
亚当·斯密关于 1770 年英国的推论，或者卡尔·马克思关于 1850 年代英国、法国和德国的推论，对于今天的美国来说显然毫无价值。一些推论可能仍然合理，但在现代美国，所有推论都值得怀疑，等待操作检查。仅仅因为亚当·斯密和马克思这样说就批评美国今天的经济行为，或者要求其改进，就像因为亚里士多德这样说而相信苍蝇有八条腿一样愚蠢。斯密和马克思都比他们的理论家同行更多地使用他们的眼睛和耳朵。例如，李嘉图可能生来就失明，但他却是一位纯粹的理论家。
Economic laws became in the hands of the classical school just laws in themselves. Often they were merely logical exercises. So it was that classical theory stood triumphantly symmetrical, an absolute! And so it is still too much taught. By a series of assumptions and with the use of certain chosen illustrations it can be worked up to climactically. And when the thing is complete—there you are! But the student goes away from the demonstration unsatisfied, frustrated, angry, feeling as though a logical trick had been played upon him. And why? Well, because for one thing, in the twentieth century the truth must be useful and this is not.
在古典学派手中，经济法本身就变成了法律。通常它们只是逻辑练习。所以古典理论胜利地对称了，绝对的！所以它仍然被教导得太多了。通过一系列假设并使用某些选定的插图，可以将其推向高潮。当事情完成时——你就在那里！但学生离开演示时却不满意、沮丧、愤怒，感觉好像有人对他开了一个逻辑把戏。为什么？嗯，因为一方面，在二十世纪，真理一定是有用的，但事实并非如此。
So says R. G. Tugwell. Meanwhile Dr. Wesley C. Mitchell observes that it is impossible to prove or disprove the classical laws.
RG Tugwell 如此说道。与此同时，Wesley C. Mitchell 博士观察到，不可能证明或反驳经典定律。
The laws and principles were developed with the industrial revolution. The Wealth of Nations was published in the same year that Watt made a steam engine which would really work—the same year, incidentally, chat the American Declaration of Independence was drafted and signed. The classicists were much influenced by notions about science, but they did not adopt the scientific method. They tried to erect economic laws like Newton’s laws of gravitation, but they did not copy Newton’s operational technique. It was like a little boy making himself into a choo-choo after seeing a locomotive.
这些法律和原则是随着工业革命而制定的。 《国富论》出版的同一年，瓦特制造了一台真正可行的蒸汽机，顺便说一句，同一年，美国《独立宣言》起草并签署。古典主义者深受科学观念的影响，但他们并没有采用科学方法。他们试图建立像牛顿万有引力定律一样的经济定律，但他们并没有照搬牛顿的操作技术。这就像一个小男孩看到机车后把自己变成了“咕咕”。
Editorial writers today are still infatuated with these “laws” of a make-believe science. They pull them out of their heads with pontifical finality whenever reformers or Congressmen propose a measure which editors do not like. “Economic law cannot so cavalierly be set aside,” they say. “We cannot circumvent the law of supply and demand any more than we can circumvent the law of gravitation.” “Only crackpots would seek to outwit the immutable principles of economics.”
今天的社论作者仍然迷恋这些虚构的科学“法则”。每当改革者或国会议员提出编辑不喜欢的措施时，他们就会以教皇般的决定性将这些想法从头脑中拉出来。 “经济法不能如此随意地搁置一边，”他们说。 “我们无法规避供需定律，就像我们无法规避万有引力定律一样。” “只有疯子才会试图智取永恒的经济学原理。”
Classical economics not only was largely innocent of the scientific method; it also became a kind of theology selling indulgences to businessmen. As factories expanded after Watt’s steam engine, a philosophy was needed to give respectability and prestige to the rising class of manufacturers. The philosophy was first identified with the “natural laws” of Newton. Then it twined itself like a boa constrictor (yes, I am conscious of abstracting) around Darwin’s hypothesis of the “survival of the fittest.” What a handout! The greatest good for the greatest number, so ran the dogma, arises from the unimpeded competitive activities of enlightened self-interest. The faster the stragglers arc bankrupted and undone, the stronger the economic frame. What appears as competitive anarchy is not really anarchy at all, but a beneficent system of control by natural forces. The big fish eats the little fish, the strong businessman eats the weak. It is all very gratifying and lovely, and as remote from reality as the labors of Hercules.
古典经济学不仅在很大程度上与科学方法无关，而且在很大程度上也与科学方法无关。它也成为一种向商人出售赎罪券的神学。随着瓦特蒸汽机之后工厂的扩张，需要一种哲学来为新兴的制造商阶层提供尊重和声望。该哲学首先被认为是牛顿的“自然法则”。然后它像一条大蟒蛇（是的，我有意识地抽象）缠绕在达尔文的“适者生存”假设周围。多么好的施舍啊！按照这一教条，最大多数人的最大利益来自于开明的利己主义的不受阻碍的竞争活动。掉队者破产和破产的速度越快，经济框架就越强大。看似竞争性的无政府状态根本不是真正的无政府状态，而是自然力量的仁慈控制体系。大鱼吃小鱼，强商吃弱者。这一切都非常令人欣慰和可爱，却像赫拉克勒斯的劳动一样远离现实。
In 1798, Malthus published his famous essay on population, one of the grandest examples of extrapolation on record. The essay was in part designed to answer William Godwin’s argument to the effect that mankind could achieve happiness through the use of reason. Malthus wanted to scotch the dangerous idea that happiness was in prospect for the mass of the people. (The principle of “original sin” again.) So by study of the exceedingly unreliable statistics of the time, he laid down two postulates: first, that population tends to grow at a geometrical rate; second, that the food supply tends to grow at an arithmetical rate. The population of England was then 7,000,000; in a hundred years if the curve was followed it would be, he said, 112,000,000. If food was sufficient for the 7,000,000 in 1800, by 1900 the supply would expand to feed only 35,000,000—“which would leave a population of 77,000,000 totally unprovided for.”
1798 年，马尔萨斯发表了他关于人口的著名论文，这是有记录以来最伟大的外推法例子之一。这篇文章的部分目的是为了回答威廉·戈德温的论点，即人类可以通过运用理性来实现幸福。马尔萨斯想要摒弃“大众有望获得幸福”的危险观念。 （又是“原罪”原理。） 于是，通过研究当时极不可靠的统计数据，他提出了两个假设：第一，人口趋于几何级数增长；第二，人口呈几何级数增长。其次，粮食供应往往以算术速度增长。当时英格兰的人口为七百万；他说，如果遵循这条曲线，一百年后这个数字将达到 112,000,000。如果 1800 年的食物足以满足 7,000,000 人的需要，那么到 1900 年，供应量将扩大到只能养活 35,000,000 人——“这将使 77,000,000 人完全得不到食物。”
This fantastic hypothesis was then solemnly applied to the problem of poverty. As population was destined to leap ahead of food supply, restrained only by pestilence, war, and famine, it followed that measures to improve the living-standards of the mass of the people were futile. “It is, undoubtedly, a most disheartening reflection, that the great obstacle in the way of any extraordinary improvement in society, is of a nature that we can never hope to overcome.” That stopped the fellow Godwin in his tracks. The essay was also used for decades as conclusive proof that reform laws were pernicious. In the second edition of his essay, in 1803, Malthus relented to the point where a new element was introduced into his equations. If the poor would employ “moral restraint” in their procreational activities, they might possibly gain a notch or two on the food supply. It was very cheering news to the well-to-do. The poor had themselves to blame for their poverty, and even if moral restraint was widely practiced, poverty was largely inevitable anyhow.
这个奇妙的假设随后被郑重地应用于贫困问题。由于人口注定会超越粮食供应，而仅受到瘟疫、战争和饥荒的限制，随之而来的是，提高人民群众生活水平的措施是徒劳的。 “毫无疑问，这是一个最令人沮丧的反映，社会任何非凡进步的巨大障碍都是我们永远无法克服的。”这让戈德温同伴停下了脚步。几十年来，这篇文章还被用作改革法有害的决定性证据。 1803 年，马尔萨斯在论文的第二版中做出了让步，在他的方程中引入了一个新元素。如果穷人在生育活动中采用“道德约束”，他们的食物供应可能会提高一两个等级。对于富人来说，这是一个非常令人振奋的消息。穷人应该为自己的贫困负责，即使广泛实行道德约束，贫困在很大程度上也是不可避免的。
Malthus’s iron law of population was paralleled by Ricardo’s iron law of wages. This great principle put poor people in another vise. Since labor is a commodity, said Ricardo, its price goes up and down with demand. When demand for labor is slack, wages will remain at the bare-subsistence level. If demand becomes brisk, wages will rise, workers will have more money. They will then produce more children, and presently the addition to the population will bring the price of labor back to bare-subsistence level again. So what is the use of trying to improve the condition of the workers?
马尔萨斯的人口铁律与李嘉图的工资铁律并行。这个伟大的原则使穷人陷入了另一个困境。李嘉图表示，由于劳动力是一种商品，因此其价格会随着需求而上下波动。当劳动力需求疲软时，工资将维持在勉强维持生计的水平。如果需求旺盛，工资就会上涨，工人就会有更多的钱。然后他们将生育更多的孩子，目前人口的增加将使劳动力价格再次回到勉强维持生计的水平。那么，努力改善工人的处境有什么用呢？
Nassau Senior “proved” that hours of labor could not be reduced, because the employer’s profit came out of the last hour of operation. A 68-hour week was common at the time. Eliminate that last hour, he said, and industrial profits would be eliminated, and the business of the nation ruined. Thus if children in factories worked 67 hours rather than 68, panic would replace prosperity. Senior’s analysis was derived from theoretical examples where the arithmetic was correct but the assumptions untenable.
Nassau Senior“证明”劳动时间无法减少，因为雇主的利润来自最后一小时的运营。每周工作 68 小时在当时很常见。他说，消除最后一个小时，工业利润就会消失，国家的商业就会毁掉。因此，如果工厂里的孩子工作 67 小时而不是 68 小时，恐慌就会取代繁荣。西尼尔的分析是从理论例子中得出的，其中算术是正确的，但假设是站不住脚的。
Senior’s contribution to economic theory proved that hours could not be reduced. John Stuart Mill and other classicists proved that wages could not be raised, by the famous “wage-fund doctrine.”1 Workers joined unions and struck for a raise. Pure madness, said the economists. Why? Because there was a certain fund set aside out of capital for the payment of wages. There was a certain number of wage-earners. Divide the first by the second. It was all arranged by Heaven and arithmetic, and trade-unions could do nothing about it. The wage-fund theory was the stock answer of the manufacturer and editor to the claims of organized workmen. It had been blessed by economists and must be true.
西尼尔对经济理论的贡献证明了工作时间不能减少。约翰·斯图尔特·密尔和其他古典主义者通过著名的“工资基金学说”证明了工资无法提高。1 工人加入工会并罢工要求加薪。经济学家们说，这纯粹是疯狂。为什么？因为资本里有一定的资金用于支付工资。有一定数量的工薪阶层。将第一个除以第二个。这一切都是天意安排的，工会也无能为力。工资基金理论是制造商和编辑对有组织工人的主张的一贯回答。它受到了经济学家的祝福，而且一定是真的。
Observe how these “laws” were put to tangible use, holding back improvements in working-conditions for scores of years. The philosophers produced nonsense which was at least disinterested. Many of these classical economists had an ax to grind, and cruelly sharp they ground it. Not until 1876 was the wage-fund theory exploded by an American economist, Francis Walker. He argued that wages were paid not out of a fund of stored capital, but out of current earnings—a theory which came closer to the facts. It is a pleasure to note that John Stuart Mill, who first popularized the wagefund hypothesis in his Principles of Political Economy in 1848, published the following statement years later: “The doctrine hitherto taught by most economists (including myself) which denied it to be possible that trade combinations can raise wages . . . is deprived of its scientific foundation, and must be thrown aside.” A brave, fine statement. But working people in England and elsewhere for fifty years had paid a bitter price for a “law” that had no scientific foundation.
观察这些“法律”是如何被实际运用的，多年来阻碍了工作条件的改善。哲学家们的胡言乱语至少是无私的。这些古典经济学家中的许多人都有着一把利刃，而且他们的利刃锋利得残酷无情。直到 1876 年，美国经济学家弗朗西斯·沃克才推翻了工资基金理论。他认为工资不是从储存资本中支付的，而是从当前收入中支付的——这一理论更接近事实。令人高兴的是，约翰·斯图尔特·密尔 (John Stuart Mill) 于 1848 年在其《政治经济学原理》中首次普及了工资基金假说，并在几年后发表了以下声明：“迄今为止，大多数经济学家（包括我自己）所教导的这一学说否认它是贸易合并有可能提高工资。 。 。被剥夺了科学基础，必须被抛弃。”勇敢而美好的声明。但五十年来，英国和其他地方的劳动人民为一项没有科学依据的“法律”付出了惨痛的代价。
Orthodox economists have had a particularly bad time of it since 1929. Governments all over the world have been indulging in financial operations of a shockingly unorthodox character. As Chester T. Crowell points out in the New Republic, the learned faculty stands on the sidelines shouting, “No! You can’t do that!” And while they shout, it is done. The economically impossible is performed again and again. For instance:
自 1929 年以来，正统经济学家经历了一段特别糟糕的时期。世界各国政府一直在沉迷于极其非正统的金融运作。正如切斯特·T·克罗威尔（Chester T. Crowell）在《新共和》中指出的那样，博学的教师们站在场边大喊：“不！你不能这么做！”当他们喊叫的时候，事情就完成了。经济上不可能的事情一次又一次地进行。例如：
1. Mussolini simply could not carry on his vast operations in Ethiopia with a gold reserve of only $300,000,000. It was unthinkable. The reserve was a mere drop in the bucket; it would be gone in a month. But Mussolini did it. Ethiopia was brought to heel, and Italy is still afloat financially.
1. 墨索里尼根本无法在埃塞俄比亚进行他的大规模行动，他的黄金储备只有3亿美元。这是不可想象的。储备金只是杯水车薪；一个月后就会消失。但墨索里尼做到了。埃塞俄比亚屈服了，而意大利的财政状况仍然良好。
2. If a nation has a gold coverage of less than 2 per cent, obviously it has no currency worthy of the name. Panic and chaos are inevitable. It cannot hope to carry on foreign trade; its citizens will fly from their native money standard. In terms of respectable economic theory, the German financial system today is a corpse. But the corpse does not fall down. It goes right on acting as if it were alive.
2. 如果一个国家的黄金覆盖率低于2%，显然它没有名副其实的货币。恐慌和混乱是不可避免的。它不能指望进行对外贸易；它的公民将远离他们本国的货币标准。从受人尊敬的经济理论来看，今天的德国金融体系已经是一具尸体。但尸体并没有倒下。它的表现就像是活生生的一样。
3. We were all brought up on the fundamental idea that if the British Treasury ever repudiated a government debt, it would be the end of the pound sterling and of world trade. The financial backbone of the planet would be broken. Well, the British Treasury owes the American Treasury some billions of dollars, and the latter can whistle for its money. The pound remains firm, and ships still sail the seas. Because of the repudiation, Congress passed the Johnson Act, forbidding loans to warring nations, and so giving the American people one of the sturdiest defenses against being dragged into war that it was ever our good fortune to secure. England’s perfidy has been our blessing.
3. 我们从小就接受这样的基本观念：如果英国财政部拒绝偿还政府债务，那么英镑和世界贸易就将终结。地球的金融支柱将会被打破。好吧，英国财政部欠美国财政部数十亿美元，而后者可以吹口哨要钱。英镑依然坚挺，船只仍在海上航行。由于拒绝，国会通过了《约翰逊法案》，禁止向交战国家提供贷款，从而为美国人民提供了防止被拖入战争的最坚固的防御措施之一，这是我们的幸运。英格兰的背信弃义是我们的福气。
4. A nation, we were taught, could not go off the gold standard in fact, no matter how many proclamations its statesmen made. If it devalued, prices would shoot up, and gold would still be master. The United States went off the gold standard by proclamation, and most domestic prices hardly fluttered. France, which clung nobly to gold, suffered a much more severe depression than the reprobates who abandoned it.
4. 我们被教导，一个国家实际上不能脱离金本位制，无论其政治家发表了多少宣言。如果它贬值，价格就会上涨，而黄金仍然会占据主导地位。美国宣布取消金本位制，大多数国内价格几乎没有波动。崇高地坚持黄金的法国，遭受了比放弃黄金的恶棍更严重的萧条。
Yes, the orthodox economists are having difficulties on the sidelines. Is the trouble with the wicked world which pays little attention to their “laws,” or is the trouble with the laws themselves? How valid are “natural laws” which can be violated right and left?
是的，正统经济学家在场外遇到了困难。是邪恶世界不重视“法律”的问题，还是法律本身的问题？可以左右违反的“自然法则”有多有效？

TO THE LEFT WITH THE ECONOMISTS
与经济学家一起向左
THE classical economists fitted out the businessman with a fine new philosophical suit. The workers went spiritually ragged until Karl Marx came along with fine new suits for them. Marx’s philosophy was the first comprehensive statement of the theory of socialism. As an offset to the classicists, it was badly needed. As a contribution to knowledge, the case is more dubious. In drawing inferences from the facts which he had so conscientiously collected, he mixed in Ricardo’s labor theory of value, Hegel’s interpretation of history (thesis, antithesis, synthesis), and a large and very human dose of emotional sympathy for the downtrodden, together with hatred for their exploiters. So the final product was part scientific observation, part classical theory, part contemporary philosophy, part good, rousing propaganda.
古典经济学家为商人穿上了一套精美的新哲学套装。工人们在精神上变得疲惫不堪，直到卡尔·马克思为他们带来了精美的新西装。马克思哲学是对社会主义理论的第一次全面阐述。作为古典主义者的补偿，它是非常需要的。作为对知识的贡献，这个案子更加可疑。在从他认真收集的事实中得出推论时，他融入了李嘉图的劳动价值论、黑格尔对历史的解释（正题、对立、综合），以及对受压迫者的大量的、非常人性化的情感同情，以及对剥削者的仇恨。因此，最终的产品一半是科学观察，一半是经典理论，一半是当代哲学，一半是良好的、振奋人心的宣传。
The followers of Marx, by and large, have dropped the scientific observation overboard, and clung to the theory, the philosophy, and the hatred. Their facts are still drawn from the England of 1850. They have turned this great scholar into a kind of demigod. Current questions are settled not by the facts of today but by the authority of the Master: “Marx says . . .” Aristotle and the Schoolmen over again. To check the inferences of Marx by operational experiment today would be a long, arduous undertaking. Here we have but time to note one or two tests.
马克思的追随者总体上已经放弃了科学观察，而执着于理论、哲学和仇恨。他们的事实仍然取自1850年的英国。他们把这位伟大的学者变成了半神。当前的问题不是由当今的事实来解决，而是由大师的权威来解决：“马克思说…… 。 ”。亚里士多德和经院学者再次重演。今天，通过可操作的实验来检验马克思的推论将是一项长期而艰巨的任务。这里我们只有时间来记录一两个测试。
Marx drew his concept of dialectical materialism from Hegel. Hegel we remember as the metaphysician who upbraided the astronomers for trying to find more planets when philosophy had established the number at 7 for eternity. “Of all the philosophers since Plato,” observes Hogben, “none has adopted a world view more diametrically opposed to the scientific outlook.”
马克思从黑格尔那里汲取了辩证唯物主义的概念。我们记得黑格尔是一位形而上学家，当哲学将这个数字确定为永恒时，他谴责天文学家试图寻找更多的行星。霍格本观察到，“自柏拉图以来的所有哲学家中，没有人采用与科学观更加截然相反的世界观。”
Perhaps Hegel’s chief accomplishment was the reestablishment of the occult properties of the number 3. The secret of the universe, he said, lies in finding out how reason works. Reason equals unity. Waste no time on experiment or observation. Every argument which arises in the quest of the absolute consists of three parts (the magic three):
也许黑格尔的主要成就是重建了数字3的神秘属性。他说，宇宙的秘密在于找出理性是如何运作的。理性等于统一。不要在实验或观察上浪费时间。在追求绝对的过程中出现的每一个论证都由三个部分组成（神奇的三部分）：
The first step—which Hegel seldom succeeded in taking—is a plain statement, and is called “thesis.”
第一步——黑格尔很少成功地迈出——是一个简单的陈述，被称为“论文”。
The second step is the negation or contradiction of that statement, and is called “anti-thesis.”
第二步是对该陈述的否定或反驳，称为“反论点”。
The third step is the negation of the negation, combining the higher truth in both the preceding steps. It is called “synthesis.”
第三步是否定之否定，将前面两个步骤中的更高真理结合起来。这就是所谓的“综合”。
All history, said Hegel, follows this law. Marx, in applying the parade of abstractions to economics, identified capitalism as thesis, labor as antithesis, and the classless society as synthesis. Neat and logical, but what does it mean? Where are the referents? There is no vestige of the scientific method here. The dialectic tells us that when two forces clash, something happens. We knew that before. It does not tell what the things are with any clarity, and it makes a wild extrapolation as to the result.
黑格尔说，一切历史都遵循这个规律。马克思在将一系列抽象概念应用于经济学时，将资本主义视为主题，将劳动视为对立，将无阶级社会视为综合。简洁且合乎逻辑，但这意味着什么？参考对象在哪里？这里没有科学方法的痕迹。辩证法告诉我们，当两种力量发生冲突时，就会发生一些事情。我们以前就知道这一点。它并没有清楚地说明事物是什么，而且对结果进行了疯狂的推断。
Marx moves closer to the real world when he leaves Hegel and his magical triad, and says that methods of production determine human culture. Operations can be performed to show the great effect of, for instance, mass production on human living and human institutions. But Marx went off the deep end by making this verifiable tendency into an absolute. He dropped out many characteristics—as moralists drop them in the case of the “bad” girl. Elements of race, religion, climate, plagues, and many other things help determine human culture too. Take a look at Hans Zinsser’s Rats, Lice and History for a demonstration of the profound effects of parasites (biological, not economic) upon human culture. The essential point to grasp semantically is that Marx used his mind like a philosopher, not like a scientist, in his concepts of dialectical materialism. True, he was a better analyst than most philosophers; but to hold that he established a rigorous and inevitable course which history must take is akin to holding a belief in the second coming of Christ. The assertions in the “proof” are verbal and so unverifiable.
当马克思离开黑格尔和他的神奇三元组时，他离现实世界更近了，他说生产方式决定了人类文化。例如，可以通过操作来显示大规模生产对人类生活和人类机构的巨大影响。但马克思却把这种可验证的趋势变成了绝对，从而走入了深渊。他放弃了许多特征——就像道德家在“坏”女孩身上放弃这些特征一样。种族、宗教、气候、瘟疫和许多其他因素也有助于决定人类文化。看看汉斯·辛瑟（Hans Zinsser）的《老鼠、虱子和历史》，了解寄生虫（生物上的，而非经济上的）对人类文化的深远影响。从语义上把握的要点是，马克思在辩证唯物主义概念中像哲学家而不是科学家一样运用他的思想。确实，他是一位比大多数哲学家更好的分析师。但是，如果认为他确立了历史必须走的严格而不可避免的路线，就类似于相信基督的第二次降临。 “证据”中的断言是口头的，因此无法证实。
The labor theory of value was a concept which could not be adequately verified even in Marx’s day, when industrial undertakings were relatively simple. He held that “the value of one commodity is to the value of any other as the labor-time necessary for the production of the one is to that necessary for the production of the other.” If four man-hours were spent making a hat and twelve man-hours making a stove, the value of the stove was equal to the value of three hats. No scientist would waste five minutes attempting to verify this “law.” What are the referents for “value,” “labor-time,” “production”? Marx realized well enough that an inefficient worker did not produce hats and stoves of high value, because he wasted time in producing them. So he had to bring in a vague concept of “average skill,” “average efficiency,” a kind of average “economic workingman.”1
即使在工业事业相对简单的马克思时代，劳动价值论也是一个无法得到充分验证的概念。他认为，“一种商品的价值与任何其他商品的价值之比，就像生产一种商品所需的劳动时间与生产另一种商品所需的劳动时间之比一样。”如果用四个工时制作一顶帽子，十二个工时制作一个炉子，那么炉子的价值等于三顶帽子的价值。没有科学家会浪费五分钟试图验证这个“定律”。 “价值”、“劳动时间”、“生产”的指称是什么？马克思清楚地认识到，效率低下的工人无法生产出高价值的帽子和炉子，因为他在生产它们时浪费了时间。因此，他不得不引入“平均技能”、“平均效率”等模糊概念，即一种平均的“经济工人”1。
Today the concept is even farther from being verified. At certain places we are producing electric power without a man in the generating plant. The powerhouse is operated automatically by remote control. I have tried to work out the man-hour cost of various forms of transportation. This can be roughly estimated for the operation and maintenance of railroads, truck lines, waterways, pipe lines; but when it comes to finding the man-hours which once went into surveying, building, and equipping the railways and the highways, into dredging the rivers for barge-line transportation, digging the trenches for pipe lines, plus the annual depreciation and obsolescence thereof, the analysis runs clear off the map. Increasingly we use inanimate energy from falling water, coal, oil, in place of human muscle; increasingly we use photoelectric cells in place of the human mind for many industrial tasks; increasingly we use automatic dials in place of telephone girls. That labor is the major factor in producing most commodities nobody denies. But exact measurement of man-hour cost, including both capital and operating factors, is too complicated to perform. I know whereof I speak, for as an accountant I have tried to measure it more than once. So there is no operational foundation to prove the labor theory of value. You can say it, but you cannot do it.
如今，这个概念距离得到验证还很远。在某些地方，我们在发电厂无人值守的情况下发电。动力室采用遥控自动操作。我尝试计算出各种交通方式的工时成本。这可以粗略估计铁路、卡车线路、水路、管道的运营和维护；但是，当谈到曾经用于测量、建造和装备铁路和公路、疏浚河流以进行驳船运输、挖掘管道管道沟渠的工时，加上每年的折旧和报废时， ，分析在地图上一目了然。我们越来越多地使用来自落下的水、煤、石油的无生命能量来代替人体肌肉；我们越来越多地使用光电电池来代替人类思维来完成许多工业任务；我们越来越多地使用自动拨号来代替接线员。无人否认，劳动力是生产大多数商品的主要因素。但精确测量工时成本（包括资本和运营因素）过于复杂，难以执行。我知道我在说什么，因为作为一名会计师，我不止一次地试图衡量它。因此劳动价值论没有可操作性的基础来证明。你可以说，但你做不到。
The American economist John Bates Clark observed in a famous textbook:
美国经济学家约翰·贝茨·克拉克在一本著名教科书中观察到：
Free competition tends to give to labor what labor creates, to capitalists what capital creates, and to entrepreneurs what the co-ordinating function creates. . . . To each agent a distinguishable share in production, to each a corresponding reward—such is the natural law of distribution.
自由竞争倾向于将劳动创造的东西赋予劳动者，将资本创造的东西赋予资本家，将协调职能创造的东西赋予企业家。 。 。 。每个代理人在生产中都有可区分的份额，每个代理人都有相应的奖励——这就是分配的自然法则。
Labor creates all value, says Marx.
马克思说，劳动创造一切价值。
Labor, capital, and the entrepreneur create all value, says Clark.
克拉克说，劳动力、资本和企业家创造了所有价值。
Land, labor, and capital create all value, say others.
其他人说，土地、劳动力和资本创造了所有价值。
Abandoning the theorists and rushing into open country to see what is actually happening, before going mad, one finds that any commodity useful to men or desired by men either falls out of a tree like a coconut, or is produced by Adam1, Adam2, Adam3, using their hands and heads. Adam1, however, may be aided by inanimate energy supplied for him by Adam4, on the basis of an invention made by Adam5 (now dead), from a scientific law worked out by Adam6 in 1828. He may be aided by a machine or a process to which a host of Adams, living and dead, have contributed. Where is “land,” where is “capital,” where is “labor” in this landscape? The facts cannot be jammed into these abstractions without violence.
抛开理论家，冲进空旷的乡村去看看到底发生了什么，在发疯之前，你会发现任何对人类有用或人类想要的商品要么像椰子一样从树上掉下来，要么是由亚当1、亚当2、亚当3生产出来的。 ，用他们的手和头。然而，亚当 1 可能会得到亚当 4 为他提供的无生命能量的帮助，这是基于亚当 5（现已去世）根据亚当 6 于 1828 年制定的科学定律所做的一项发明。他可能会得到机器或机器的帮助。许多亚当斯，无论是在世的还是已故的，都为这一进程做出了贡献。在这幅风景中，“土地”在哪里，“资本”在哪里，“劳动力”在哪里？如果不使用暴力，就无法将事实塞进这些抽象概念中。
Marx said that the rich would get richer and the poor poorer. In America, and to a lesser degree in Europe, the rich got richer and the majority of the poor got richer. Marx did not anticipate the curious split between legal owners and operating managers in great corporations, where the “capitalists” are often shaken down by the nonowning management with a thoroughness similar to that shown in shaking down the workers. Read The Investor Fays by Max Lowenthal. On the other hand, Marx did imply that an era of monopoly would replace the era of competition, and the facts of today in part support him.
马克思说过，富人会更富，穷人会更穷。在美国，在较小程度上在欧洲，富人变得更富，而大多数穷人变得更富。马克思没有预料到大公司的合法所有者和经营管理者之间会出现奇怪的分歧，在这些公司中，“资本家”经常受到非所有者管理层的镇压，其彻底性类似于镇压工人。阅读马克斯·洛文塔尔 (Max Lowenthal) 所著的《投资者的烦恼》(The Investor Fays)。另一方面，马克思确实暗示垄断时代将取代竞争时代，今天的事实在一定程度上支持了他的观点。
He thought that manual workers would become increasingly depressed and discontented. Finally they would revolt and gain ascendancy by sheer force of numbers. In America today the Middle Class, on one careful count,1 is numerically larger than the proletariat, while the strategic importance of the engineer and the technician introduces a new and important element into the situation.
他认为体力劳动者会变得越来越沮丧和不满。最终，他们会反抗并凭借绝对的人数优势取得优势。在今天的美国，仔细统计一下，1 中产阶级在数量上比无产阶级还要多，而工程师和技术人员的战略重要性则给这种情况带来了一个新的重要因素。
Marx thought that capitalism would become more and more international, and only an international organization of workers could furnish the “antithesis” to cope with it. The workers of the world would unite. He was partly right for the period from 1860 to 1918, but after the War a strong trend toward nationalism, autarchy, self-sufficiency, set in. Today industry and finance become increasingly national, while international bankers hold up their hands in impotent horror at the goings-on in Italy and Germany. They tell Herr Schacht it cannot be done, but he does it. Meanwhile the science of agrobiology promises a dependable method for making the smallest nation self-sufficient in respect to its food and technical crops. Meanwhile Japan is engaged in throwing Western nations out of China. Radicals trying to operate on an international basis today are like motorists trying to explore Maine guided by a map of Texas. Trotsky is thus a better Marxist than Stalin. But he has a much worse map.
马克思认为资本主义将变得越来越国际化，只有国际工人组织才能提供“对立”来应对它。全世界的工人将会联合起来。他在 1860 年至 1918 年期间的观点部分正确，但战后出现了一种强烈的民族主义、独裁、自给自足的趋势。今天，工业和金融变得越来越国家化，而国际银行家则举起双手，无能为力地惊恐万状。意大利和德国发生的事情。他们告诉沙赫特先生这是不可能的，但他却做到了。与此同时，农业生物学科学有望提供一种可靠的方法，使最小的国家在粮食和技术作物方面实现自给自足。与此同时，日本正致力于将西方国家赶出中国。今天，激进分子试图在国际范围内运作，就像驾车者试图在德克萨斯州地图的引导下探索缅因州一样。因此，托洛茨基是比斯大林更好的马克思主义者。但他有一张更糟糕的地图。
The idea of the “class struggle” was cardinal in Marx’s theory. In 1850 or thereabouts, he observed in western Europe a real struggle between wage-earners and factory-owners. Perhaps of the many struggles between various groups at the time it was the most important. He then froze the notion into an absolute. It was not an absolute then, and it is not so today. In the United States we now observe struggles between rival industries—railroads versus highway trucks, oil versus coal; struggles between the banks and manufacturers for control of the plant; between Wall Street financiers and the farmers of the West and South whose mortgages Wall Street holds; between New England textile mills and Southern textile mills; between chain stores and independent groceries; between city and country; between importers and domestic manufacturers; between whites and Negroes; between the American Federation of Labor and the Committee for Industrial Organization. The struggle between workers and owners (or managers) is still present and exceedingly important, but it is only one of a score of bitter struggles now raging along the economic front. Indeed, for really bad blood, the struggle between Marxists who support Stalin and those who support Trotsky outstrips them all. Here are two excerpts covering a convention in America in 1937, the first from a socialist paper, the second from a communist one:
“阶级斗争”的思想是马克思理论的核心。大约在 1850 年左右，他在西欧观察到工资收入者和工厂主之间的真正斗争。也许在当时不同群体之间的众多斗争中，这是最重要的。然后他将这个想法定格为绝对的。当时这不是绝对的，今天也不是绝对的。在美国，我们现在观察到竞争行业之间的斗争——铁路与公路卡车、石油与煤炭；银行和制造商之间争夺工厂控制权的斗争；华尔街金融家与华尔街持有抵押贷款的西部和南部农民之间；新英格兰纺织厂和南方纺织厂之间；连锁店和独立杂货店之间；城市与乡村之间；进口商和国内制造商之间；白人和黑人之间；美国劳工联合会和工业组织委员会之间的关系。工人和业主（或管理者）之间的斗争仍然存在，而且极其重要，但这只是目前经济战线上肆虐的数十场激烈斗争之一。事实上，支持斯大林的马克思主义者和支持托洛茨基的马克思主义者之间的斗争确实比其他人更激烈。以下是 1937 年美国一次大会的两段摘录，第一个来自社会主义报纸，第二个来自共产主义报纸：
The convention turned a deaf ear to every siren’s plea to turn in the direction of class collaboration. The furious drive of the Communist Party to carry the convention along this line crashed its bloody head against a stone wall.
大会对每个海妖转向班级合作方向的请求充耳不闻。共产党沿着这条路线推进全国代表大会的疯狂动力，把它血淋淋的头撞到了石墙上。
The Trotskyite wreckers have their own reserves. At the head of this gang of bandits in the United States is the notorious swindler Max Eastman. . . . On the same platform with Eastman was Norman Thomas. The Trotskyites won the Socialist Party to objective support of Trotsky’s pact with Hitler and the Japanese militants.
托派破坏分子有自己的储备。美国这伙土匪的头目就是臭名昭著的骗子马克斯·伊士曼。 。 。 。与伊士曼处于同一平台的还有诺曼·托马斯。托洛茨基派赢得了社会党对托洛茨基与希特勒和日本武装分子的协议的客观支持。
Marx, borrowing heavily from Hegel, extrapolated the class struggle and made it apply to present and to past. It was to apply to the future until the millennium of the classless society should arrive. The communist editor today turns a news story—any news story—over to his copy writer and says, “Class-angle that, Jim.” The good member believes in the class struggle as the good Catholic believes in the Immaculate Conception. Meanwhile General Motors comes to terms with the C.I.O. in the hope—or so the rumor goes—that the C.I.O. will make it good and hot for Henry Ford. Meanwhile the local managers of the United States Steel Corporation wanted to fight the C.I.O., but Wall Street bankers of the Steel Corporation—and this is more than a rumor—said, “No, sign up with the C.I.O. and save money.” Meanwhile the United States Government, controlled by the capitalists, as good Marxists know, gives Mr. John Lewis the opportunity to organize workers, assisted by Governor Murphy of Michigan and Governor Earle of Pennsylvania, while the so-called capitalist press roars for the scalp of President Roosevelt. Where in this turmoil is a valid distinction between “working class” and “master class”?
马克思大量借鉴黑格尔的思想，对阶级斗争进行了推断，并将其应用于现在和过去。它适用于未来，直到无阶级社会的千年到来。今天，共产主义编辑将新闻报道（任何新闻报道）交给他的文案撰稿人并说：“吉姆，从阶级角度来看。”优秀的成员相信阶级斗争，就像优秀的天主教徒相信圣母无染原罪一样。与此同时，通用汽车公司与首席信息官达成协议，希望——至少有传言是这样——首席信息官能让亨利·福特变得更好、更受欢迎。与此同时，美国钢铁公司的当地经理想要对抗 CIO，但钢铁公司的华尔街银行家——这不仅仅是谣言——说：“不，与 CIO 签约可以省钱。”与此同时，正如优秀的马克思主义者所知，由资本家控制的美国政府给了约翰·刘易斯先生组织工人的机会，并得到了密歇根州州长墨菲和宾夕法尼亚州州长厄尔的协助，而所谓的资本主义媒体则在咆哮。罗斯福总统的。在这场动荡中，“工人阶级”和“大师阶级”之间的有效区别在哪里？
There are class struggles here and class struggles there—take a look at the violent labor history of Harlan County, Kentucky—but the class struggle is useless as an absolute. Users of the phrase disregard the date of Marx’s observations in the 1850’s. The place, western Europe, is disregarded. The fact that it was a hypothesis is disregarded. The operational approach is disregarded. Other economic struggles are disregarded. The outstanding significance of the middle class today is disregarded. Many characteristics are left out. What Marx would have made of the “class struggle” as codified and distorted by his disciples I do not know. Perhaps not much.
这里有阶级斗争，那里有阶级斗争——看看肯塔基州哈伦县的暴力劳工历史——但绝对的阶级斗争是没有用的。该短语的使用者忽视了马克思在 1850 年代的观察的日期。西欧这个地方被忽视了。这是一个假设的事实被忽视了。操作方法被忽视。其他经济斗争被忽视。当今中产阶级的突出意义被忽视了。许多特征被遗漏了。我不知道马克思会如何看待他的弟子编纂和歪曲的“阶级斗争”。也许不多。
It may be objected that while the term is without tangible validity, it provides a useful psychological stimulus to labor organization. It furnishes a feeling of solidarity and fighting morale. This is the old argument in defense of any means to achieve a given end. Waiving moral aspects altogether, it seems to me that the term “class struggle,” by giving an incorrect picture of the world as it is, hinders the strategy of those who want to improve economic conditions. A general who disposes his troops on the basis of an inaccurate map is not likely to win many battles. The class-struggle map is probably a major reason why the socialist movement has made so little progress in America.
也许有人会反对，虽然这个术语没有切实的有效性，但它为劳工组织提供了有用的心理刺激。它提供了一种团结的感觉和战斗士气。这是捍卫任何达到既定目的的手段的古老论点。完全放弃道德方面，在我看来，“阶级斗争”一词通过对世界的本来面目给出了错误的描述，阻碍了那些想要改善经济状况的人的战略。一个根据不准确的地图部署军队的将军不可能赢得很多战争。阶级斗争地图可能是美国社会主义运动进展缓慢的一个主要原因。
When the class struggle becomes an article of faith, the “worker” is canonized, and “labor” can do no wrong. Any strike is a holy crusade; any man with a pick is a better fellow than any man with a plug hat. Hollowchested clerks feel strong as they identify themselves with “labor,” and gladly join the picket line. In New York recently a strike was called in a group of co-operative restaurants. Many members of the organization were defenders of “labor” as well as of the “co-operative commonwealth.” The strike put them in an embarrassing predicament. Should they support the “worker” or the “cooperative ideal”? Meetings were held and souls were searched. A functioning, useful organization was torn in two and all but wrecked by this battle of rival dogmas.
当阶级斗争成为信仰时，“工人”就被尊崇，“劳工”就不会做错事。任何罢工都是一场神圣的十字军东征；任何有镐的人都比任何有塞帽的人更好。胸膛空心的职员因为认同自己是“劳工”而感到坚强，并高兴地加入纠察队。最近，纽约的一些合作餐馆发起了罢工。该组织的许多成员都是“劳工”和“合作联邦”的捍卫者。这次罢工使他们陷入了尴尬的困境。他们应该支持“工人”还是“合作理想”？召开了会议，搜查了灵魂。一个正常运作、有用的组织被撕成两半，并在这场相互对立的教条之战中几乎被摧毁。
What kind of a labor union? When? Where? Once these questions are examined and answered, the ghosts depart, and reformers begin to realize that some unions are initiated by crooks, that some are organized for purely commercial purposes, and that some are functionless. I have been working with the American labor movement off and on for fifteen years, and by many firsthand observations have learned both the courageous devotion and the dirty deals to be found in this field. To prostrate oneself before “labor” is of no help to workingmen and women. Many socialist intellectuals, says Bertrand Russell, consider it de rigueur to find the proletariat superior to other people “while professing a desire to abolish the conditions which, according to them, alone produce good human beings. Children were idealized by Wordsworth and un-idealized by Freud. Marx was the Wordsworth of the proletariat; its Freud is still to come.”
什么样的工会？什么时候？在哪里？一旦这些问题得到检验和回答，鬼魂就消失了，改革者开始意识到有些工会是由骗子发起的，有些工会是为了纯粹的商业目的而组织的，有些工会毫无作用。我已经断断续续地与美国劳工运动合作了十五年，通过许多第一手观察，我了解到这个领域中存在着勇敢的奉献和肮脏的交易。屈服于“劳动”对于工人来说是没有任何帮助的。伯特兰·罗素说，许多社会主义知识分子认为，发现无产阶级优于其他人是理所当然的，“同时又声称希望废除他们认为仅能产生优秀人类的条件。”华兹华斯将儿童理想化，而弗洛伊德则没有理想化儿童。马克思是无产阶级的华兹华斯；弗洛伊德尚未到来。”
CAPITALISM
资本主义
As an abstraction, “capitalism” may be useful in saving the breath required to describe every transaction on the market. But a thing “capitalism” is not to be found stalking with gigantic hooves and horrid scales over any market place. When Art Young, the great cartoonist, draws a monster, he knows and you know what is intended—a poetic image. (Sometimes, however, one wonders if cartoons do not aid the creation of verbal monsters.) Discussion of “capitalism” is now widespread, especially as opposed to the abstraction “socialism.” The verbal forms normally employed make it evident that the speaker has no consciousness that the word is not the thing. Capitalism fights, he says, is making its last stand. It is even crawling back into Russia, presumably on hands and knees. Capitalism and socialism are locked in mortal combat. Fascism lines up with capitalism. Capitalism seeks foreign markets, grinds the worker as in a coffee mill. Capitalism gets up and capitalism falls down.
作为一个抽象概念，“资本主义”可能有助于节省描述市场上每笔交易所需的时间。但在任何市场上都找不到“资本主义”这个东西以巨大的蹄子和可怕的规模跟踪。当伟大的漫画家阿特·杨（Art Young）画一个怪物时，他知道你也知道他的意图是什么——一个诗意的形象。 （然而，有时人们想知道卡通是否有助于创造语言怪物。）“资本主义”的讨论现在很普遍，尤其是相对于抽象概念“社会主义”。通常使用的动词形式表明说话者并没有意识到单词不是事物。他说，资本主义的斗争正在做最后的抵抗。它甚至正在爬回俄罗斯，大概是手脚并用。资本主义和社会主义正陷入殊死搏斗。法西斯主义与资本主义是一致的。资本主义寻求国外市场，像在咖啡磨坊里一样碾压工人。资本主义兴盛，资本主义衰落。
“Capitalism” is thus a shape, a form, which speaks, commands, fights, runs away. Asked to define it, the debater on the left introduces more abstractions: “Absentee ownership,” “surplus value,” “class struggle,” “private ownership of the means of production,” “exploitation of the masses,” “imperialism,” “vested interests,” “proletariat,” “bourgeoisie,” the “profit system,” and many more. The great words roll. The Schoolmen perspired no harder in their Aristotelian squirrel cages. From time to time, the reasoner thrusts a hand into the world outside and seizes a raw, living fact. If it pleases his argument, he hauls it squirming into the cage. If not, he drops it.
因此，“资本主义”是一种形状、一种形式，它会说话、命令、战斗、逃跑。当被要求对其进行定义时，左翼辩论者引入了更多抽象概念：“缺席所有制”、“剩余价值”、“阶级斗争”、“生产资料私有制”、“对群众的剥削”、“帝国主义”、 “既得利益者”、“无产阶级”、“资产阶级”、“利润体系”等等。伟大的话语滚滚而来。经院学者们在亚里士多德式的松鼠笼里出汗并不多。推理者时不时地把手伸向外面的世界，抓住一个原始的、活生生的事实。如果他的论点满意，他就会把它蠕动着拖进笼子里。如果没有，他就会放弃它。
In an adjoining cage, the proponents of the word are going through a similar revolving process with different terms: “sturdy individualism,” “self-help,” “thrift,” the “law of supply and demand,” “initiative,” “regimentation,” “bureaucracy,” “capital will leave the country,” “orders from Moscow,” “if you divided all the money up it would be back in the same hands in six months.” Listen to the Rev. Charles Vaughn, of Los Angeles:
在毗邻的笼子里，这个词的支持者正在经历一个类似的循环过程，使用不同的术语：“坚定的个人主义”、“自助”、“节俭”、“供需法则”、“主动性”、“管制”、“官僚主义”、“资本将离开这个国家”、“来自莫斯科的命令”、“如果你把所有的钱都分了，六个月后就会回到同样的人手里。”听听洛杉矶牧师查尔斯·沃恩 (Charles Vaughn) 的说法：
The Russian Revolution was a Jewish baby. The Jewish banking houses of Wall Street financed the Revolution, and as a result, thirty million white Christian peoples have starved in Russia under communistic rule. . . . Communism is anti-Christ and belongs to those who teach anti-Christ. . . . It is time to get the whole gang of aliens and put them across the sea where they belong. We believe it is Christian-like to deport these aliens!
俄罗斯革命是一个犹太婴儿。华尔街的犹太银行为革命提供了资金，结果，三千万白人基督徒在共产主义统治下的俄罗斯挨饿。 。 。 。共产主义是反基督的，属于那些教导反基督的人。 。 。 。是时候把整群外星人都抓起来，把他们送到属于他们的地方了。我们相信驱逐这些外国人是基督徒的行为！
Note not only the meaningless abstractions, but the identification of “Russian communist” with “Jew,” with “anti-Christ,” with “aliens in America,” and the rousing conclusion to deport all aliens, including apparently a covey of Wall Street bankers.
不仅要注意毫无意义的抽象概念，还要注意将“俄罗斯共产主义者”与“犹太人”、“反基督”、“在美国的外国人”等同起来，以及驱逐所有外国人的激动人心的结论，其中显然包括华尔街的一小群人银行家。
Psittacism, we recall, is the name for the habit of using words without thought. Often a single symbol is enough to start the words flowing, even as prompting a parrot will cause him to run through his piece. The man on the left hears the word “profit,” and proceeds to intone, “You can’t get anywhere until you destroy the profit system.” The man on the right hears the word “socialism,” and throwing back his head and shutting his eyes, he roars, “You can’t change human nature!”
我们记得，唯心主义是不加思考地使用词语的习惯的名称。通常，一个符号就足以让文字开始流动，即使提示鹦鹉会让他跑完他的作品。左边的人听到“利润”这个词，然后继续吟诵，“除非你摧毁利润体系，否则你将一事无成。”右边的人听到“社会主义”这个词，猛地仰起头，闭上眼睛，咆哮道：“你无法改变人性！”
Radicals hate “capitalism.” But there is no such animal. They are hating nothingness. It is akin to hating the Devil. Who is the Devil? Who is “capitalism”? One might as well waste his emotions hating the Martians. Bumping into Morgan1, Morgan2, radicals do not hate them much. The cigars of Morgan2 are excellent. Well, they say they hate “the system.” Another monster. Hating monsters or just hating around loose provides highly inaccurate maps for political strategy. It confuses many concrete situations where some excellent measure could really be advanced. It alienates potential friends, especially among the professional ranks. It doubles the strength of the opposition by raising mild disapproval to blind fury. It plays beautifully into the hands of the Rev. Dr. Charles Vaughn.
激进分子讨厌“资本主义”。但没有这样的动物。他们讨厌虚无。这类似于憎恨魔鬼。谁是魔鬼？谁是“资本主义”？一个人还不如浪费自己的感情来憎恨火星人。碰上摩根1、摩根2，激进分子并不怎么讨厌他们。 Morgan2的雪茄非常好。好吧，他们说他们讨厌“这个系统”。另一个怪物。憎恨怪物或只是憎恨周围的人，为政治策略提供了非常不准确的地图。它混淆了许多具体情况，而在这些情况下确实可以采取一些出色的措施。它疏远了潜在的朋友，尤其是专业人士中的朋友。它通过将温和的反对升级为盲目的愤怒，使反对派的力量加倍。它非常适合查尔斯·沃恩牧师博士的手中。
Again, by objectifying the assumption “No improvement possible until the profit system is destroyed” radicals misinterpret the environment. No “profit system” exists as an entity in the real world. Instead one has to study the behavior of Adam1 and Adam2, Morgan1 and Morgan2. President Roosevelt, having no immutable economic principles, has begun more reforms in the economic picture in five years than reformers have accomplished in a hundred and fifty. Yet because he did not shake his fist at the “profit system,” his undertaking has been judged as worse than nothing by the left-wingers and regarded dubiously by many reformers. They do not look at what is going on under their noses; they are listening in a kind of trance to words inside their heads.
再次，通过客观化“除非利润体系被摧毁，否则不可能有任何改善”的假设，激进分子误解了环境。现实世界中不存在作为实体的“利润系统”。相反，我们必须研究 Adam1 和 Adam2、Morgan1 和 Morgan2 的行为。罗斯福总统没有一成不变的经济原则，他在五年内开始的经济改革比改革者一百五十年来完成的还要多。但由于他没有向“利润制度”挥舞拳头，他的这一举措被左翼人士视为比没有更糟，也被许多改革派怀疑。他们不看眼皮底下发生的事情；他们在一种恍惚的状态下聆听着脑海中的话语。
I have heard reformers debate for hours whether the New Deal “is” “state socialism” or “state capitalism” or just ornery “liberalism.” If it is “state socialism,” then it is all right; if it is “state capitalism,” it is all wrong; if it is plain “liberalism,” it is beneath contempt. Presumably sane men, arguing interminably. I have advocated reform in the field of economics for most of my life and I intend to continue. But I am sick and tired of trying to reform things which are not there, of fighting things which do not exist. If the purpose of an economic system is to supply people with necessities and comforts, let us try to see the people, see the commodities, see the institutions, as they actually hang together, and throw such strength as we possess into making real changes in a real situation.
我听到改革者们争论了几个小时，新政到底“是”“国家社会主义”还是“国家资本主义”，还是只是脾气暴躁的“自由主义”。如果是“国家社会主义”就可以，如果是“国家社会主义”就可以。如果是“国家资本主义”，那就错了；如果是“国家资本主义”，那就错了。如果它是纯粹的“自由主义”，那就是值得蔑视的。想必都是心智正常的人，无休止地争论。我一生中大部分时间都在倡导经济领域的改革，并且我打算继续下去。但我厌倦了试图改革不存在的事物，厌倦了与不存在的事物作斗争。如果经济体系的目的是为人们提供必需品和舒适，那么让我们尝试着看人民、看商品、看制度，因为它们实际上是相互联系在一起的，并投入我们所拥有的力量来做出真正的改变。真实的情况。
Consider the solemn, simple books starting with “land, labor, capital.” Each contributes; each must receive its rightful share. The chief share the physical land surface of America has received to date is ruination of its humus over immense areas by man-made erosion. Capital produces equally with labor and must have its share. Capital earns, capital works—in every “sound” textbook, editorial treatise, argument. “Capital” is a word. I challenge you to find its referents. It never turned a sod, lifted a hammer, even made a scratch with a pen. It never produced anything, never consumed anything, never needed anything. Try to take a photograph of “capital” in action. Money goes to Morgan1, who is labeled “capitalist.” You can photograph him, all smiles, receiving a piece of paper called a dividend check. If all receivers of dividend and interest checks were stood up for inspection and counted, the exhibit would be interesting but confusing. Some millions of standers in America would be found to be also wage-earners, and therefore properly “labor.” So “labor” gets both “wages” and “profits”? Ask the White Queen. She is the only authority competent to handle the matter.
想想那些以“土地、劳动力、资本”开头的严肃、简单的书。各有所贡献；每个人都必须得到其应有的份额。迄今为止，美国陆地表面的主要部分是人为侵蚀对大片地区腐殖质的破坏。资本与劳动力平等地生产，并且必须有其份额。资本赚钱，资本运作——在每一本“健全的”教科书、社论论文、论点中。 “资本”是一个词。我挑战你找到它的指称。它从来没有翻过草皮，举起过锤子，甚至没有用笔划过。它从不生产任何东西，从不消耗任何东西，从不需要任何东西。尝试拍摄一张行动中的“资本”的照片。钱流向了摩根1，他被贴上了“资本家”的标签。你可以拍下他满面笑容，收到一张叫做股息支票的纸片。如果所有股息和利息支票的接收者都站起来接受检查并清点，那么这个展览将很有趣，但也令人困惑。美国数以百万计的观众也会被发现也是工薪阶层，因此也是恰当的“劳动者”。那么“劳动”既获得“工资”又获得“利润”？去问白皇后吧。她是唯一有权处理此事的当局。
We have circled all around “capital” and “capitalism,” but made little progress in defining them. Well, what do the terms mean? Frankly, I do not know. I used to believe that I did, but that was before I took up semantics. As an accountant, I know what capital means to the X.Y.Z. Company, not very accurately, to be sure, but well enough to audit books and outline policy. I know something about “capitals” of certain sorts in certain places at certain times, but very little about “capital.” As for “capitalism,” I confess myself stumped. I do not know how to perform an operation to give the concept meaning. But one can safely say this: If “capitalism” be used as a short cut for the sum total of economic activities carried on under the direction of private individuals and groups, those activities had certain characteristics in western Europe when Marx wrote his great book in the 1850’s. In the United States at that time, the characteristics were different. By 1900 in the United States they had again changed greatly from what they were in 1850, as large corporations and trusts came into the picture. By 1929 they were widely different again, as the financial men increasingly dominated the industrial men. Today, characteristics have changed once more as the Government engages in distributing money through relief and other public channels. Meanwhile characteristics in England, Sweden, Germany, and Italy are different from those in the United States, and different from each other. There may be legitimate concepts for “capitalisms,” but no fixed concept “capitalism,” any more than in the case of “length” or “time.”
我们一直围绕着“资本”和“资本主义”，但在定义它们方面进展甚微。嗯，这些术语是什么意思？坦白说，我不知道。我曾经相信我做到了，但那是在我开始学习语义学之前。作为一名会计师，我知道资本对 XYZ 公司意味着什么，当然不是很准确，但足以审计账簿和概述政策。我对某些地方、某些时间的某些类型的“资本”有所了解，但对“资本”却知之甚少。至于“资本主义”，我承认自己被难住了。我不知道如何执行操作来赋予这个概念含义。但我们可以有把握地说：如果用“资本主义”作为在私人和团体指导下进行的经济活动总和的捷径，那么当马克思在《马克思主义著作》中写下他的伟大著作时，这些活动就具有西欧的某些特征。 1850年代。当时的美国，特点是不同的。到 1900 年，随着大公司和信托机构的出现，美国的情况与 1850 年相比再次发生了巨大变化。到了 1929 年，随着金融人士日益主导工业人士，他们再次出现了巨大的不同。如今，随着政府通过救济和其他公共渠道分配资金，特征再次发生了变化。同时，英国、瑞典、德国和意大利的特点与美国不同，而且彼此不同。 “资本主义”可能有合法的概念，但“资本主义”没有固定的概念，就像“长度”或“时间”一样。
Setting aside the fighting labels “capitalism” and “socialism” and examining the real world of economic activity today, we find:
抛开“资本主义”和“社会主义”的标签，审视当今经济活动的现实世界，我们发现：
Activities or businesses where most decisions are made by community officials under legislative permit, such as the Post Office.
大多数决策由社区官员在立法许可下做出的活动或企业，例如邮局。
Businesses where most decisions are made by a private enterpriser, such as a bootblack stand.
大多数决策由私营企业主做出的企业，例如擦鞋摊。
Businesses where decisions are mixed. This category, at a guess, covers 95 per cent of all economic activity in America today. Here are six million farmers affected by government legislation and administration covering crop production, soil conservation, water conservation, mortgage requirements, seed loans, co-operative marketing, and many other matters. Here are railroads, bus lines, utilities, banks, slaughterhouses, stock markets, and other businesses legally “affected with a public interest” under community supervision through regulating commissions. Here are businesses limited in their decisions by child-labor laws or minimum-wage laws; by safety laws; by regulations about adulteration and misbranding, sanitary inspection, building inspection; by the Wagner Act for collective bargaining; by resale price maintenance laws; and so forth and so on. Here are businesses heavily in debt to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, businesses being operated by federal receivers, businesses dependent upon tariff legislation.
决策混合的企业。据猜测，这一类别涵盖了当今美国所有经济活动的 95%。有 600 万农民受到政府立法和行政管理的影响，涉及作物生产、土壤保持、水源保护、抵押贷款要求、种子贷款、合作营销和许多其他事项。这里有铁路、公交线路、公用事业、银行、屠宰场、股票市场和其他合法“受公共利益影响”的企业，并通过监管委员会接受社区监督。以下企业的决策受到童工法或最低工资法的限制；遵守安全法；遵守有关掺假和贴错标签、卫生检查、建筑检查的规定；遵守《瓦格纳集体谈判法》；遵守转售价格维持法；等等等等。这些企业对重建金融公司负债累累，企业由联邦接管人经营，企业依赖关税立法。
The Post Office may be a referent for “socialism” and the bootblack for “capitalism,” but in between lies a no man’s land of private and public policy-making. In June, 1937, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain of England, supposedly a warm defender of capitalism, brought forward a bill to force all British electric companies into regional combinations, with reduced rates for consumers. Roars of protest went up from many of the companies involved, of which 371 were owned by municipalities (socialism) and 255 were owned by private stockholders (capitalism). The “socialist” roars were as loud as the “capitalist” roars. Says the London correspondent of the New York Times, “This may not be socialism, but at least it is not capitalism as die-hards here or elsewhere understand it.” While a British financial journal cries: “Schemes like these are not even socialism. They are bureaucracy gone mad!”
邮局可能是“社会主义”的指称，也是“资本主义”的擦鞋匠，但在两者之间存在着私人和公共政策制定的无人区。 1937 年 6 月，英国首相内维尔·张伯伦（据称是资本主义的热情捍卫者）提出了一项法案，迫使所有英国电力公司进行区域性合并，并降低消费者的电费。许多参与其中的公司发起了抗议，其中 371 家为市政当局所有（社会主义），255 家为私人股东所有（资本主义）。 “社会主义”的怒吼与“资本主义”的怒吼一样响亮。 《纽约时报》驻伦敦记者说：“这可能不是社会主义，但至少不是这里或其他地方的顽固分子所理解的资本主义。”英国一家金融杂志大声疾呼：“这样的计划甚至不是社会主义。他们是疯了的官僚机构！”
Is a great corporation like the New Haven Railroad capitalism or socialism? When the bootblack goes broke, he ceases to operate. The New Haven Railroad can go broke every other Friday, and not a train will stop running, not a commuter fail to find the 8:27 as per schedule. Even Paramount Theaters can go into bankruptcy, but thousands of their movie houses continue to exhibit the latest sensations from Hollywood. Such organizations are too vast, too vital a part of public life, for their physical dissolution to be permitted, however much their stocks and bonds may be reduced to wallpaper.
像纽黑文铁路这样的大公司是资本主义还是社会主义？当擦鞋匠破产时，他就停止营业。纽黑文铁路每隔一个星期五就会破产，但没有一列火车会停止运行，也没有一个通勤者无法按计划找到 8:27。即使派拉蒙剧院也可能破产，但其数千家电影院仍在继续放映好莱坞的最新电影。这些组织规模太大，是公共生活中太重要的一部分，无论它们的股票和债券可能沦为壁纸，它们的实体解散都是不被允许的。
Where is your “socialism” and where your “capitalism” in the light of these living facts? What kind of a “capitalism” is it when managers of great corporations, often not owning a share of stock, override and sometimes fleece the legal shareholders? A friend of mine recently dispatched a research worker to the New York Public Library to find for him a good definition and description of “capitalism.” The research worker returned after two weeks more confused than when he began.
从这些活生生的事实来看，你的“社会主义”在哪里，你的“资本主义”在哪里？当大公司的管理者通常不拥有股份，却凌驾于合法股东之上，有时甚至是敲诈勒索时，这是什么样的“资本主义”？我的一位朋友最近派了一名研究人员到纽约公共图书馆，为他寻找“资本主义”的良好定义和描述。两周后，这位研究人员回来了，比开始时更加困惑。
“The rights of property” as an absolute will land one in a similar befuddlement, despite the editorial battalions who give their lives to the defense of this great principle. Where were the rights of property when the Prohibition Amendment wiped a billion dollars of brewery and distillery securities off the books without a cent of compensation? Where was due process of law? Where is private property in anthracite coal deposits when miners in Pennsylvania today are swarming upon company lands, digging out the coal, loading it into trucks, and selling it in Philadelphia and New York for their own account? No judge or jury will convict them of grand larceny, not a state militiaman will move against them. Why? Because the principle of survival has overridden that of private property, and the people of the anthracite region know it, and act upon it. Where is private property when a farmer in western Kansas, under the new soil-conservation law, must plow his lands in a certain manner to act as brakes against dust storms or the community will send its agents to plow the land for him? Does a sit-down striker have a property right in his job, or does he not? What kind of property? Where? When? The naked principle is meaningless.
尽管编辑们为捍卫这一伟大原则而献出了自己的生命，但“财产权”作为一种绝对的权利也会使人们陷入类似的困惑。当禁酒令修正案将价值 10 亿美元的啤酒厂和酿酒厂证券从账簿上抹去，而没有得到一分钱的补偿时，财产权在哪里？正当法律程序在哪里？如今，当宾夕法尼亚州的矿工涌入公司土地，挖出煤炭，将其装上卡车，然后在费城和纽约为自己出售时，无烟煤矿床中的私有财产在哪里？没有法官或陪审团会判定他们犯有重大盗窃罪，州民兵也不会对他们采取行动。为什么？因为生存原则已经凌驾于私有财产之上，无烟煤地区的人们都知道这一点，并采取行动。根据新的土壤保护法，堪萨斯州西部的农民必须以某种方式犁地以防止沙尘暴，否则社区将派代理人为他耕地，那么私有财产在哪里？静坐罢工者在他的工作中是否拥有财产权？什么样的财产？在哪里？什么时候？赤裸裸的原则是没有意义的。
Is capitalism declining? I once answered this question flatly and brashly in the affirmative. In the New York Times of May 26, 1937, Alexander Dana Noyes, dean of financial editors, answers it with equal flatness and brashness in the negative. He says that capitalism is on a firm base again, but that “the Old Wall Street has gone forever.” If C stands for capitalism, and X for the financial methods of 1929, then, according to Mr. Noyes, C - X = C. Capitalism, having lost a leg, is again intact and on a firm base.
资本主义正在衰落吗？对于这个问题，我曾经斩钉截铁、傲慢地给出了肯定的回答。 1937 年 5 月 26 日，财经编辑部主任亚历山大·达纳·诺伊斯 (Alexander Dana Noyes) 在《纽约时报》上给出了同样平淡而又鲁莽的否定回答。他说，资本主义再次奠定了坚实的基础，但“旧华尔街已经一去不复返了”。如果C代表资本主义，X代表1929年的金融方法，那么，根据诺伊斯先生的说法，C - X = C。失去一条腿的资本主义又完好无损，基础稳固。
To carry on the symbolism—it cannot be dignified as mathematics—if all economic enterprises in the United States be counted year by year and called N, and the number operated by private parties free from control or interference by the community be counted and called P, the per cent of P to N has been declining for years, with a kind of cascade since 1929. Is “capitalism” then declining? Why worry a dry bone?
继续象征意义——不能像数学一样尊严——如果逐年统计美国所有的经济企业，称为N，而不受社会控制或干预的私人经营者的数量，称为P ，P 到 N 的百分比多年来一直在下降，自 1929 年以来呈级联式下降。那么“资本主义”正在衰落吗？为什么要担心枯骨呢？

SWING YOUR PARTNERS WITH THE ECONOMISTS
与经济学家一起摇摆你的合作伙伴
CONSIDERATIONS of capitalism lead to considerations of money. Perhaps when Bassett Jones completes his study of monetary operations there will exist a constructable and workable concept of money—derived not merely out of our heads, but as all workable concepts must be derived, from our actual experience. Meanwhile neither you nor I nor anyone else knows what “money” is or how it works. We know what it means where and when we use it, for here we are performing little personal operations. But its general laws, if any, are unknown to even the wisest banker or the profoundest economist. How dare I make such a statement? Because if you locked the wisest banker and the profoundest economist in a closet and told them to settle the money question, in a few minutes, it is safe to say, the whole house would begin to shake.
对资本主义的考虑导致对金钱的考虑。也许当巴塞特·琼斯完成他对货币操作的研究时，就会存在一个可构建且可行的货币概念——不仅源自我们的头脑，而且所有可行的概念都必须源自我们的实际经验。与此同时，你、我或其他任何人都不知道“钱”是什么或者它是如何运作的。我们知道在何时何地使用它意味着什么，因为在这里我们很少进行个人操作。但它的一般规律（如果有的话）即使是最聪明的银行家或最深刻的经济学家也不知道。我怎么敢发表这样的言论？因为如果你把最聪明的银行家和最深刻的经济学家锁在柜子里，让他们解决金钱问题，可以肯定地说，几分钟后，整个房子就会开始震动。
It is possible, however, to make a few observations around the edges of “money.” It is not edible. It is not wearable. It is a symbol without industrial utility, except in the case of metals. Today little, if any, use is made of gold as actual money. It is stocked in vaults or concretelined caves in the ground. A large part of all dollar transactions are accomplished by a transfer of numbers from one ledger sheet to another; a small part are accomplished by handing about pieces of paper and metal. Perhaps the most important thing about money is the human willingness to accept it. On the tenth of the month I take a checkbook and mail around some scraps of paper with my name upon them, covering furnace oil, tennis balls, shirts, garden seeds, roast beef, electric current—and tradesmen profess themselves satisfied. It is all very strange, but there you are. We agree to take money, even if we cannot agree as to what the word means. The value behind the symbol is doctrinal. A piece of paper money is like a word; it has no value in itself. Money in one’s pocket helps procure a hat, but a $5-bill is not a hat.
然而，围绕“金钱”的边缘进行一些观察是可能的。它不可食用。它不可穿戴。除了金属之外，它是没有工业实用性的符号。如今，黄金几乎没有被用作实际货币。它储存在地下的拱顶或混凝土洞穴中。所有美元交易的很大一部分都是通过将数字从一张账本转移到另一张账本来完成的；一小部分是通过传递纸片和金属来完成的。也许关于金钱最重要的是人们接受它的意愿。本月十日，我拿一本支票簿，邮寄一些写有我名字的纸片，包括炉油、网球、衬衫、花园种子、烤牛肉、电流——商人声称自己很满意。这一切都很奇怪，但你就在那里。我们同意接受金钱，即使我们不能就这个词的含义达成一致。符号背后的价值是教义性的。一张纸币就像一个字；它本身没有任何价值。口袋里的钱有助于购买帽子，但 5 美元的钞票并不是帽子。
Most of us identify the bill with the hat, believing that “money” means “goods and services” per se. This illegitimate identification probably causes a large share of our financial troubles. It is obviously folly to accumulate symbols worthless in themselves if in the process confidence in them is undermined. Well-to-do people in the United States are toiling manfully at this task. They would keep the symbol at the cost of its referent. They want to eliminate large taxes and New Deal laws and save their money. Yet if the social legislation is thrown out in toto, the result might well be a new boom and an even grander smash, quite destroying popular confidence in the financial system.
我们大多数人都将钞票与帽子联系起来，认为“钱”本身就意味着“商品和服务”。这种非法身份识别可能是造成我们大部分财务问题的原因。如果在此过程中人们对符号的信心受到损害，那么积累本身毫无价值的符号显然是愚蠢的。美国的富裕人民正在英勇地完成这项任务。他们会以牺牲其所指对象为代价来保留该符号。他们希望取消巨额税收和新政法律并节省开支。然而，如果社会立法被彻底抛弃，结果很可能会出现新的繁荣和更大的崩溃，从而彻底摧毁公众对金融体系的信心。
Thus many of our leading citizens are doing their best to lose their money. Leading citizens down the ages seem to have fixed habits along this line. They are not necessarily greedy or cruel, but they become so stuffed with principles inside their heads that they lose sight of what is going on outside. Their maps become more inaccurate, their acts more fantastic. Presently the environment blows up under them and when the smoke clears away, there are no leading citizens in sight. We recall, among many examples, the Bourbons of France, the southern planters, the hacendados of Mexico under Diaz, the Russian nobility.
因此，我们的许多主要公民都在竭尽全力地损失金钱。历代的领袖人物似乎都有着这样的固定习惯。他们不一定是贪婪或残忍的，但他们的头脑中充满了原则，以至于忽视了外面正在发生的事情。他们的地图变得更加不准确，他们的行为变得更加荒诞。不久，他们脚下的环境就爆炸了，当烟雾散去时，就看不到任何领导人了。在许多例子中，我们回想起法国的波旁王朝、南方种植园主、迪亚兹统治下的墨西哥庄园、俄罗斯贵族。
Because leading citizens have looked inward rather than outward in the past, it does not follow that they must always do so. Leading citizens are sometimes useful citizens. Today there is no objective reason why they cannot retain enough of their money to keep them comfortable while allowing their fellow-citizens a little more comfort and a little less resentment at the same time. But one fears they must first undergo a course in semantic training.
因为领导公民过去一直向内看而不是向外看，所以并不意味着他们必须总是这样做。领导公民有时也是有用的公民。今天，他们没有客观原因不能保留足够的钱来让自己过得舒适，同时让他们的同胞多一点安慰，同时少一点怨恨。但人们担心他们必须首先接受语义培训课程。
In February, 1933, confidence in American money retreated to the point where nearly every bank was closed. It is estimated that the depression wiped out some $200,000,000,000. Thus we have already stood upon the brink, and it will not take much more to push us over. Where will the paper be then? The paper will be worthless and Morgan1 will be on the pavement with Adam1. It would appear that if we desire to continue a money system—which is far more convenient than barter—we must see to it that people continue to believe in it as a useful help in getting goods made and passed around. This involves keeping people reasonably well fed, well housed, and well employed. It is not without significance that the peak of unemployment and the collapse of the banks came in the same month.
1933 年 2 月，人们对美国货币的信心下降到几乎所有银行都关门的程度。据估计，经济大萧条损失了约 200,000,000,000 美元。这样，我们就已经站在了悬崖边上，用不了多久就能把我们推倒。那么纸会在哪里呢？这篇论文将毫无价值，摩根1将与亚当1一起走在人行道上。看来，如果我们希望继续使用比以物易物方便得多的货币体系，我们必须确保人们继续相信它是制造和流通商品的有用帮助。这包括让人们吃得好、住得好、就业好。失业高峰和银行倒闭发生在同一个月，这并非没有意义。
“Property” in the sense of land, a house, tools, has quite different characteristics from “property” as stocks, bonds, and cash. Owners identify the two concepts (A is A) and think of their paper as something tangible, like a wheat field or a stone castle. Yet the validity of the paper concept rests in the hope, and it can be nothing more, that in the future physical goods and services will be furnished by someone because of these claims. Suppose the someone, some time, becomes weary and ceases to furnish them? Then the material income will not be forthcoming, and the paper property will be worthless. If the claims are to hold good, the industrial plant must be encouraged to operate steadily with employees who are not too dissatisfied. Often, however, to “protect” their property, holders of stocks and bonds jeopardize steady operation by low wages, long hours, and monopolistic prices. They bitterly protest attempts by the Government to aid stability—not only foolish attempts, but all attempts. On principle.
土地、房屋、工具等意义上的“财产”与股票、债券、现金等“财产”有着截然不同的特征。所有者识别这两个概念（A 是 A），并将他们的论文视为有形的东西，例如麦田或石头城堡。然而，纸质概念的有效性在于希望，而且仅此而已，未来有人会因为这些主张而提供实物商品和服务。假设某人某个时候变得疲倦并且不再提供它们呢？那么物质收入就不会到来，纸质财产也将变得一文不值。如果这些说法成立，就必须鼓励工厂稳定运营，让员工不太不满意。然而，为了“保护”自己的财产，股票和债券持有者往往会因低工资、长时间工作和垄断价格而危及稳定运营。他们强烈抗议政府帮助稳定的尝试——不仅是愚蠢的尝试，而且是所有的尝试。原则上。
An interesting book could be written on the subject of a logical approach to money. Many persons give it one value in the sense that “money is everything.” Many give it two values in the sense that money can be either wasted or saved. If it is wasted, public welfare is damaged; if it is saved, welfare is advanced. Two-valued logic is also found in the excited cries of “Balance the federal budget or ruin”; “Balance the budget or inflation!” It is found in the fixed idea that a penny saved is a penny earned, in the idea that a dollar of business spending is constructive and fruitful, while a dollar of government spending is destructive and barren.
关于金钱的逻辑方法的主题可以写一本有趣的书。许多人赋予它一种价值，即“金钱就是一切”。许多人赋予它两种价值，即金钱可以浪费，也可以节省。如果浪费，公共福利就受损；如果它被保存，福利就会提高。二值逻辑也体现在“平衡联邦预算，否则破产”的兴奋呼声中。 “平衡预算或通货膨胀！”人们发现，节省一分钱就是赚一分钱的固定观念，一美元的企业支出是建设性的、富有成效的，而一美元的政府支出是破坏性的、贫瘠的。
This foots up to the dreariest nonsense imaginable, for the situation is a many-valued one. At certain times when unemployment is growing, any spending, anywhere, for any purpose, will help restore equilibrium. At such times thrift is a deadly enemy of financial stability. Spend for machine guns, poison gas, rum, harlots, stone pyramids, or Boulder Dams—it makes little difference so far as the financial mechanism is concerned. People get moral principles tangled up with the transfer of numbers called money. The worthy New York Times1 devotes a great editorial to the $400,000,000 spent by the Works Progress Administration in New York City. Did the taxpayers get their money’s worth? Should there have been more dentistry for schoolchildren and fewer sewer-pipes? What was the cost compared with private enterprise? Will the WPA become permanent—horrid thought—thus starving private industry of its labor supply? Can we afford the outlay in view of the deficit in the federal budget?
这是可以想象到的最无聊的废话，因为这种情况是一个具有多种价值的情况。在失业率上升的某些时期，任何地点、任何目的的任何支出都将有助于恢复平衡。在这种时候，节俭是金融稳定的死敌。花在机枪、毒气、朗姆酒、妓女、石头金字塔或博尔德水坝上——就金融机制而言，没有什么区别。人们的道德原则与被称为金钱的数字转移纠缠在一起。值得尊敬的《纽约时报》1 为纽约市公共工程振兴管理局 (Works Progress Administration) 花费的 4 亿美元发表了一篇精彩的社论。纳税人的钱花得值吗？是否应该为学童提供更多的牙科服务并减少下水道管道？与私营企业相比，成本是多少？ WPA 会成为永久性的——可怕的想法——从而导致私营企业的劳动力供应匮乏吗？鉴于联邦预算赤字，我们能否负担得起这笔开支？
These are all interesting questions, but the most important two characteristics of the situation remain unmentioned by the Times. What would have happened had there been no federal spending? What would have been the effect upon working people in New York City if the spending had taken the form of a straight dole rather than payment for work done?
这些都是有趣的问题，但《泰晤士报》仍未提及这种情况最重要的两个特征。如果没有联邦支出，会发生什么？如果支出采取直接救济金的形式而不是按工作报酬的形式，会对纽约市的劳动人民产生什么影响？
Alexander Sachs contributes a little semantic sermon on the “gold standard.” The disparity, he says, between outworn dogmas and the facts of world recovery is illustrated by the hankering of bankers and economists for the restoration of the gold standard on the predepression model. Their solemn warnings about “inflation” after gold was abandoned were taken seriously by many investors. Some of these investors dumped their bonds on the market, while the banks themselves treated long-term Governments as “untouchables.” The result was serious and unnecessary losses for the members of the faith. To a banker or classical economist the abandonment of the gold standard was like abandoning one’s trousers at a formal dinner. In either case, no physical harm follows, but the moral shock is severe.
亚历山大·萨克斯 (Alexander Sachs) 就“黄金标准”发表了一些语义布道。他说，过时的教条与世界复苏的事实之间的差异可以从银行家和经济学家渴望恢复大萧条前模型的金本位制中得到体现。他们在放弃黄金后对“通胀”的郑重警告受到了许多投资者的重视。其中一些投资者将债券抛售到市场上，而银行本身则将长期政府视为“贱民”。结果给信仰成员带来了严重和不必要的损失。对于银行家或古典经济学家来说，放弃金本位就像在正式晚宴上脱掉裤子一样。无论哪种情况，都不会造成身体伤害，但道德上的冲击是严重的。
Modern money, as Bassett Jones studies it, is not a commodity. It does not behave like a commodity. It behaves like a transfer of numbers of which the most important characteristic is the rate of transfer. When the rate declines, depressions begin. If money is used like a commodity, the monetary device is thrown into functional disorder. When the disorder becomes acute, nations abandon the gold standard, to the horror of right-thinking citizens. Gold is a kind of vermiform appendix in the economic organism. It had a function once, but is a dangerous nuisance today—likely to burst and send us to the hospital. It began to atrophy. Jones observes, when it was no longer convenient to weigh gold in each commercial transaction, and so it began to pass out of function into ritual.
正如巴塞特·琼斯所研究的那样，现代货币并不是一种商品。它的行为不像商品。它的行为类似于数字传输，其中最重要的特征是传输速率。当比率下降时，萧条就开始了。如果货币像商品一样使用，那么货币装置就会陷入功能障碍。当混乱变得严重时，各国就会放弃金本位，这会让思想正确的公民感到恐惧。黄金是经济有机体中的一种蠕虫状附属物。它曾经有用过，但今天却是一个危险的麻烦——可能会破裂并把我们送进医院。它开始萎缩。琼斯观察到，当在每笔商业交易中称量黄金不再方便时，它开始从功能转变为仪式。
The difficulty with our understanding of money appears to be that we want it to mean something substantial, tangible, solid. Gold and silver fulfill this yearning for substance, and we cling obstinately to them in our minds. Outside in the real world, money as substance is fast disappearing. Even in Mexico the silver cartwheels are going out of use in large transactions. There is a curious paradox here. We have to use money as it actually behaves. It behaves something like an electric circuit. But we persist in thinking about money as it behaved two hundred years ago.
我们理解金钱的困难似乎在于我们希望它意味着某种实质性的、有形的、坚实的东西。黄金和白银满足了我们对物质的渴望，而我们在心中却顽固地执着于它们。在现实世界之外，金钱作为物质正在迅速消失。即使在墨西哥，银侧手翻也在大额交易中不再使用。这里有一个奇怪的悖论。我们必须按照货币的实际用途来使用它。它的行为类似于电路。但我们仍然坚持以两百年前的方式来思考金钱。
Money concepts lead to ideas about “value.” Most books on economic theory revolve around value. If the task of the student of semantics is to find the referent, the task of the economist has been to find the value. He has not found it yet, and I am afraid he never will. For “value,” apart from a price or a sum of money, is a meaningless absolute. No operation can be performed to establish it. “There is no magnitude of value apart from money.” The measurable value is what B will actually give for A’s old fishing rod, not A’s claim that he would not take $500 for it. In one context, value is a sum of money actually proffered. In another it is a loose relative term, useful in conversation, like ‘‘good” or “bad.” “This is a good thing” and “I value it highly” are similar kinds of talk. In noneconomic concepts, value is helpful, as in “many-valued logic,” and in color values graded to a scientific scale. But when you hear an economist pontifically discussing “value” as an entity, get ready for a shower of blabs.
金钱概念引发了关于“价值”的想法。大多数经济理论书籍都围绕价值展开。如果语义学学生的任务是找到指称，那么经济学家的任务就是找到价值。他还没有找到，恐怕永远也找不到。因为“价值”除了价格或一笔钱之外，是毫无意义的绝对值。无法执行任何操作来建立它。 “除了金钱之外，没有任何价值。”可衡量的价值是 B 实际愿意为 A 的旧鱼竿付出的价格，而不是 A 声称他不会花 500 美元购买的价格。在一种情况下，价值是实际提供的一笔钱。在另一种情况下，它是一个松散的相对术语，在对话中很有用，例如“好”或“坏”。 “这是一件好事”和“我非常重视它”是类似的谈话。在非经济概念中，价值是有帮助的，例如“多值逻辑”以及按科学尺度分级的颜色值。但是，当你听到一位经济学家武断地讨论作为一个实体的“价值”时，请准备好接受大量的废话。
Consider the term “inflation.” When the verbal fire got too warm, the Washington administration in self-defense adopted the word “reflation.” I have yet to find any general agreement upon what “inflation,” let alone “reflation,” means. A man has just written a book about the seven kinds of inflation. Definitions are sometimes attempted, but referents are hard to come by. Does one mean credit, currency, stock-market or land-value inflation? Some of my friends go about shaking their heads, observing that inflation is already here. Others say it is inevitably coming. Others that it may come. Others that it will not come at all. Still others hold that a headlong “deflation” is just around the corner. Think of it calmly: thousands of so-called intelligent people arguing for millions of hours, filling acres of newspaper columns, and heaven knows how many magazine and book pages, with reflections on a term that no single one of them understands. Your author is the third from the left in the front row!
考虑一下“通货膨胀”这个词。当口水战变得过于激烈时，华盛顿政府出于自卫而采用了“通货再膨胀”一词。我还没有就“通货膨胀”的含义达成任何普遍共识，更不用说“通货再膨胀”了。一个人刚刚写了一本关于七种通货膨胀的书。有时会尝试定义，但很难找到指称。通胀是指信贷、货币、股市还是土地价值通胀？我的一些朋友开始摇头，认为通货膨胀已经到来。其他人则说这是不可避免的。其他人则认为它可能会到来。其他人则认为它根本不会出现。还有一些人认为，轻率的“通货紧缩”即将来临。冷静地想一想：成千上万的所谓聪明人争论了数百万小时，填满了报纸专栏，天知道有多少杂志和书籍页面，对一个他们中没有人理解的术语进行了反思。你的作者是前排左起第三位！
Take the word “dole.” The very sound of it is depressing. A baleful word, associated with handouts, bums, bread lines, and incompetents. This word was thrown like a bomb against measures for state and federal relief. The immensity of human need prevented the barrage from being successful. Doles, or community benefits, in what form? When? Where? Once we begin looking for referents we turn up some interesting material. Since the American Republic was formed, “doles” in one form or another have been frequent and generous. Consider the protective tariff as a dole to manufacturers. Consider the gift, free or nominal, of about one billion acres of public land to homesteaders, speculators, to railroads, canal companies. Consider free highways for motorists, free sidewalks for pedestrians, free schools for children, weather reports and beacons for airplane travelers, fingerlings for fishermen, copyrights for poets, patents for inventors, the Federal Reserve System for bankers, buoys and lighthouses for yachtsmen. The list is long, as you will find by consulting Jacob Baker’s Government Benefits.
以“救济金”这个词为例。它的声音本身就令人沮丧。这是一个恶毒的词，与施舍、流浪汉、领面包的队伍和无能者联系在一起。这个词就像一颗炸弹，反对州和联邦的救济措施。人类的巨大需求阻碍了这次攻击的成功。救济金或社区福利以什么形式存在？什么时候？在哪里？一旦我们开始寻找参照物，我们就会发现一些有趣的材料。自美利坚共和国成立以来，各种形式的“救济金”一直频繁且慷慨。将保护性关税视为对制造商的救济。考虑一下向自耕农、投机者、铁路、运河公司免费或名义赠送约 10 亿英亩公共土地的情况。考虑一下为驾车者提供免费高速公路、为行人提供免费人行道、为儿童提供免费学校、为飞机旅行者提供天气预报和信标、为渔民提供鱼种、为诗人提供版权、为发明家提供专利、为银行家提供联邦储备系统、为游艇爱好者提供浮标和灯塔。通过查阅雅各布·贝克的政府福利，您会发现这个清单很长。
Regard the two abstractions “investor” and “speculator.” The former is a good demon and the latter a sorry one. Investors must be encouraged, speculators scouted. Hence laws, regulations, rules, moral codes, principles. If you go into the New York Stock Market to separate an “investor” from a “speculator,” you had better take a surgeon with you. The distinction is in our heads. On the market, any market, you find Junius1 buying and selling stocks, bonds, lands, commodities. Most of the time he does not know himself whether he is speculating or investing. Far out on one wing there may be a few pure plungers; far out on the other there may be some executors of trust estates who never think of an appreciation m their capital, but only of income. In between lie the overwhelming majority of market transactions—to quote a man who has spent his life on the Street—where one is both speculating and investing more or less. Perhaps a gap-filling word is in order—call it “investulating” or “specuvesting.”
考虑“投资者”和“投机者”这两个抽象概念。前者是善良的恶魔，后者是可怜的恶魔。必须鼓励投资者、监视投机者。因此，法律、法规、规则、道德准则、原则。如果你进入纽约股票市场来区分“投资者”和“投机者”，你最好带上一名外科医生。区别就在我们的头脑中。在市场上，任何市场上，你都会发现 Junius1 买卖股票、债券、土地、商品。大多数时候他都不知道自己是在投机还是在投资。在一侧机翼的远处可能有一些纯柱塞；另一方面，可能有一些信托财产的执行人从未考虑过资本增值，而只想到收入。引用一位在华尔街度过一生的人的话来说，绝大多数市场交易都介于两者之间，人们或多或少都在投机和投资。也许用一个填补空白的词是合适的——称之为“投资”或“投机”。
While we are in the financial mood, let us look at a sample of a weekly market letter circulated to businessmen. This industry is as profitable as it is loquacious. The formula seems to be to use a hundred words to say ten words’ worth, and two hundred words to say nothing. The use of abstractions averages perhaps higher than in philosophy.
当我们处于财务情绪中时，让我们看一下分发给商人的每周市场信件的样本。这个行业既利润丰厚，又热闹非凡。这个公式似乎是用一百个字来表达十个字的价值，用两百个字来表达什么。抽象概念的平均使用率可能高于哲学。
Washington influences on business will be abnormally mixed in the next few weeks. . . . As between inflation and deflation let inflation go on says one wing of officialdom. . . . Easy money is still the administration’s objective, less easy but in part reasonable. . . . Fear in some quarters that buyers will strike, impeding recovery. Discounted in other quarters. . . . Conspicuous industries which raise prices are looked on with growing suspicion. The tendency is to assume that prices are raised more than warranted by wage increases. Whether or not this is true is a subject of “intra-governmental” controversy. . . . The business outlook as figured by most non-political observers is based on assumption of moderate inflation, not run-away inflation. . . . Feeling reported against extreme social-mindedness within WPA President is sounding out sentiment by undercover observers in European capitals.
未来几周，华盛顿对商业的影响将异常复杂。 。 。 。官方人士之一表示，在通货膨胀和通货紧缩之间，让通货膨胀继续下去吧。 。 。 。轻松赚钱仍然是政府的目标，虽然不太容易，但在一定程度上是合理的。 。 。 。某些方面担心买家会罢工，从而阻碍复苏。其他区有折扣。 。 。 。那些抬高价格的引人注目的行业受到越来越多的怀疑。人们倾向于认为价格上涨幅度超过了工资上涨的幅度。这是否属实是“政府内部”争论的话题。 。 。 。大多数非政治观察家所描绘的商业前景是基于温和通胀的假设，而不是失控的通胀。 。 。 。据报道，WPA 主席内部存在极端社会意识，欧洲各国首都的卧底观察员正在试探他们的情绪。
This sample inspires me to undertake a word experiment. We all remember how in school examinations we sometimes shoveled in words, the longer the better, to cover up a complete lack of knowledge about a given question. Unfortunately the habit does not cease with adolescence. Suppose you ask me to define “reflation.” I do not know what “reflation” means. It is a Thingumbob I have never encountered. But that does not prevent me from explaining it if I am a market-letter writer:
这个示例启发我进行了一个单词实验。我们都记得，在学校考试中，我们有时会用文字填满，越长越好，以掩盖对给定问题的完全缺乏知识。不幸的是，这种习惯并没有随着青春期而消失。假设你让我定义“通货再膨胀”。我不知道“通货再膨胀”是什么意思。这是我从未遇到过的 Thingumbob。但这并不妨碍我解释一下，如果我是一名市场通讯作者：
Reflation is an alternative to inflation. When the Central Banks are in the strategic position of manipulating credit it is quite possible—see the action of the Danzig Kronbank in 1934—by employing sundry well-known techniques, such as the inversion of the rediscount rate, and the hazardous but conclusive open-market operations, to bring about an upward movement in values which reacts unfavorably on speculative activities, tends to thaw frozen assets in the commodity exchanges, implements stock movements, attracts gold from abroad, revivifies the climate of opinion, and so arrests the vicious spiral.
通货再膨胀是通货膨胀的替代方案。当中央银行处于操纵信贷的战略位置时，很可能（参见 1934 年但泽克朗银行的行动）采用各种众所周知的技术，例如再贴现率倒置，以及危险但决定性的开放-市场操作，带来对投机活动不利反应的价值上涨，往往会解冻商品交易所冻结的资产，实现股票走势，吸引国外黄金，恢复舆论氛围，从而阻止恶性循环。
I submit that the paragraph would look well in the financial columns of any newspaper, even in the Atlantic Monthly. I made it up out of whole cloth, and so far as I know, there is not an atom of meaning in the entire statement. Not one scintilla of sense.
我认为该段落在任何报纸的财经专栏中都看起来不错，甚至在《大西洋月刊》中也是如此。我完全胡编乱造，据我所知，整个陈述中没有任何意义。没有一丝理智的火花。
Observe the United States Government tortuously winding its way around verbal barriers to administrative action. Before spending money for public works it must, whenever possible, go through the legal process of setting up government corporations—because it is well known that “corporations are more efficient than politicians.” It must severely restrict public works to useless activities, because it is equally well known that “Government should not compete with business.” It must balance the operating part of the federal budget to propitiate the god of “balanced budgets.” The editor of the New York Times snorts balefully on discovering this sorry strategem. What a nose for sin the editor of that great paper has!
观察美国政府曲折地绕过行政行动的口头障碍。在为公共工程花钱之前，只要有可能，就必须经过设立政府公司的法律程序——因为众所周知，“公司比政客更有效率”。它必须严格限制公共工程的无用活动，因为“政府不应该与企业竞争”同样是众所周知的。它必须平衡联邦预算的运营部分，以安抚“平衡预算”之神。 《纽约时报》的编辑发现这个令人遗憾的策略后，恶狠狠地嗤之以鼻。那篇伟大报纸的编辑对罪恶的嗅觉是多么敏锐啊！
Here are two long words, “centralization” and “decentralization.” Mr. Justice Brandeis, Walter Lippmann, Felix Frankfurter, Ralph Borsodi, belong to the Decentralization School. I am supposed to belong to the Centralization School. At least, I get kicked around by the Decentralizers. I am also, it appears, a Planner, and that is pretty serious. Decentralization where? Planning for what? Such considerations are not often examined. The way to give these lofty terms meaning is to make a careful survey of the economic activities of the United States and find out which, by their technical function, are best suited to organization on a nation-wide basis—like the railroads; which are best suited to a regional organization—like flood control; which are best suited to local organization—like barbershops. Observe that this operation at once dissolves the controversy. It is no longer assumed that anyone wants centralization of everything—whatever that may mean. As technology changes, the classification of “decentralized” and “centralized” activities is bound to change. If, for instance, a practical prefabricated house is put upon the market with a factory in Cleveland making standard sections to be shipped to Portland, Oregon, and Portland, Maine, house construction ceases to be a local industry and becomes in part a national industry.
这里有两个很长的词，“中心化”和“去中心化”。布兰迪斯大法官、沃尔特·李普曼、费利克斯·法兰克福、拉尔夫·博尔索迪等人属于权力下放学派。我应该属于中央集权学校。至少，我被去中心化者踢了。看来我也是一名规划师，这是非常严肃的。去中心化在哪里？计划做什么？这些考虑因素并不经常被审查。赋予这些崇高术语含义的方法是仔细调查美国的经济活动，并根据其技术功能找出最适合在全国范围内组织的活动，例如铁路；最适合区域组织，例如防洪；最适合理发店等当地组织。观察一下，这个操作立刻就化解了争议。人们不再假设任何人都想要一切的中心化——无论这意味着什么。随着技术的变化，“去中心化”和“中心化”活动的分类必然会发生变化。例如，如果一栋实用的预制房屋投放市场，并由克利夫兰的一家工厂生产标准型材，然后运往俄勒冈州波特兰和缅因州波特兰，那么房屋建筑就不再是当地产业，而是部分成为全国性产业。
“Economic planning” has no meaning as it stands. Read almost any article on the subject, and you will lay it down more baffled than when you picked it up. It is an abstraction of a very high order, and must be put in a precise context of time, place, and kind before anything useful can be said about it.
“经济计划”就其本身而言没有任何意义。阅读几乎所有关于这个主题的文章，你会比拿起它时更加困惑。它是一个非常高阶的抽象，必须先将其置于时间、地点和种类的精确背景中，然后才能对其进行任何有用的描述。
Major premise: The Russians are planners.
大前提：俄罗斯人是计划者。
Minor premise: President Roosevelt is a planner.
小前提：罗斯福总统是一位计划者。
Therefore: President Roosevelt is a Russian—or at best a Russian agent.
因此：罗斯福总统是俄罗斯人——或者充其量是俄罗斯特工。
This false syllogism would shock even a logician. Yet it is implied if not stated in numerous articles, and in innumerable private arguments.
这种错误的三段论甚至会让逻辑学家感到震惊。然而，在无数的文章和无数的私人争论中，即使没有明确说明，它也是隐含的。
I certainly have used the term “planning” loosely in the past. Walter Lippmann takes the word and turns it solemnly round and round on the left side of the triangle. The principle of “planning,” it appears, denies the principle of “freedom.” The principle of blab1 denies the principle of blab2. Freedom is preferable to planning, therefore planning is bad. Mr. Lippmann does not bother much with referents. He deals in the higher orders. He becomes increasingly oracular. While his mind is powerful above the average, what he means at times is clear neither to his readers nor probably to himself. Isabel Paterson has observed that he writes like a revolving door. He is an intellectual descendant of Aristotle and thus a semantic calamity.1 This may not keep him from becoming a classic to be read and admired by future generations.
当然，我过去曾宽松地使用过“计划”这个词。沃尔特·李普曼领会了这个词，并在三角形的左侧庄严地旋转了一圈又一圈。 “计划”原则似乎否定了“自由”原则。 blab1的原理否定了blab2的原理。自由比计划更可取，因此计划是不好的。李普曼先生不太关心参照物。他处理更高的订单。他变得越来越神谕。虽然他的头脑比一般人强大，但有时他的读者和他自己都不清楚他的意思。伊莎贝尔·帕特森观察到他的写作就像旋转门一样。他是亚里士多德的思想后裔，因此是一场语义灾难。1这可能不会阻止他成为供后代阅读和欣赏的经典。
It is widely admitted, even by some economists, that “planning” is a vague concept, but “production” is supposed to be solid stuff. Is it? Everyone knows what “production” means. Does he? The term is clear when applied to tons of a specified kind of steel, to passenger automobiles, bushels of wheat, units of things of a given grade produced in a given geographical area over a given time. But what does “production-in-general” mean? “Physical production in the United States,” reads a recent news release, “is now back to the level of 1929.” Economists, government officials, bankers, businessmen, are continually talking about production-in-general as something of outstanding importance. It is even seriously proposed that the economic policy of governments should be guided by charts showing variations in physical output for the nation as a whole.
人们普遍承认，甚至一些经济学家也承认，“计划”是一个模糊的概念，但“生产”应该是可靠的东西。是吗？大家都知道“生产”是什么意思。他有吗？当适用于特定类型钢材的吨数、客车、小麦蒲式耳、特定地理区域在特定时间内生产的特定等级物品的单位时，该术语是明确的。但“一般生产”是什么意思呢？最近的一份新闻稿称，“美国的实物生产现已回到 1929 年的水平。”经济学家、政府官员、银行家、商人不断地把一般生产视为极其重要的事情。甚至有人严肃地提出，政府的经济政策应该以显示整个国家实物产出变化的图表为指导。
Yet when the operational test is applied it is found that production-in-general is a statistical monstrosity and not to be found anywhere on land or sea. All the composite index numbers now available showing increases or decreases in production-in-general for the United States, or for any part of it, or for any other country or area, are without meaning. Rigorous mathematical proof of this statement has been worked out by Bassett Jones, Arne Fisher, Lancelot Hogben, and others. You and I can appreciate it without the mathematical proof. One cannot combine bushels of wheat, tons of steel, sides of beef, assorted kinds of radio cabinets, pairs of silk stockings, numbers of houses, yards of cotton sheeting, and bottles of beer into a composite entity which makes sense. Sugar and chocolate can be poured into a pot and candy produced which makes sense. Try pouring the commodities listed above into a pot. The more complicated the mathematics applied to the pot, the more erudite the systems of averaging and chaining, the more absurd the result. After developing his magnificent concept of proof, Pythagoras fell into the swamp of mystic numbers. Economic statisticians are modern Pythagoreans. Mathematics cannot be legitimately used to jam together on paper things which are never jammed in the outside world except in freight-train wrecks.
然而，当进行操作测试时，我们发现总体生产是一个统计上的怪物，在陆地或海上的任何地方都找不到。现在可用的所有综合指数数字显示美国或其任何部分或任何其他国家或地区的总体产量增加或减少，都是没有意义的。 Bassett Jones、Arne Fisher、Lancelot Hogben 等人已经对这一说法进行了严格的数学证明。你我都可以在没有数学证明的情况下欣赏它。人们无法将一蒲式耳的小麦、数吨的钢铁、牛肉、各种无线电柜、双丝袜、房屋数量、棉布床单和啤酒瓶组合成一个有意义的复合实体。糖和巧克力可以倒入锅中并生产糖果，这是有道理的。尝试将上面列出的商品倒入锅中。应用于底池的数学越复杂，平均和链接系统越博学，结果就越荒谬。在发展了他宏伟的证明概念之后，毕达哥拉斯陷入了神秘数字的沼泽。经济统计学家是现代毕达哥拉斯主义者。数学不能合法地用来将纸上的东西塞在一起，而除了货运列车失事之外，这些东西在外面的世界里永远不会被塞在一起。
When a great banker says with satisfaction, “Production is increasing, look at the curve,” he might equally well observe, “Blue-haired mermaids are increasing, look at the curve.” The curve may be neatly plotted on crosssection paper in both cases, but that is as far as visibility extends. A governmental or private planning authority attempting to direct policy on the basis of production-in-general index numbers may presently find itself in the position of those wizards of finance who were plotting the course of stocks and of business just before the smash in 1919. Their curves went up and up while the facts went down and down. Similar warnings apply to composite indices of purchasing power, cost of living, wholesale and retail prices. I prophesy some alarming situations if and when governments seek to manage economic activity on the basis of the arithmetical monsters now at their disposal. The phenomenon is a clear case of semantic confusion. Because we employ a high-order abstraction as a short-cut tag for all kinds and varieties of things being produced, it is felt that the word “production” means something in its own right, and a grotesque mathematical procedure is actually worked out to give it validity.
当一位伟大的银行家满意地说“产量正在增加，看看曲线”时，他也可能会观察到，“蓝发美人鱼正在增加，看看曲线。”在这两种情况下，曲线都可以整齐地绘制在横截面纸上，但这只是可见性范围内的。试图根据一般生产指数来指导政策的政府或私人计划机构目前可能会发现自己处于那些金融奇才的境地，他们在 1919 年股市大跌之前策划股票和商业的走势。他们的曲线不断上升，而事实则不断下降。类似的警告也适用于购买力、生活成本、批发和零售价格的综合指数。我预言，如果政府试图根据目前掌握的数学怪物来管理经济活动，将会出现一些令人震惊的情况。这种现象是语义混乱的明显例子。因为我们使用高阶抽象作为各种正在生产的事物的快捷标签，所以感觉“生产”这个词本身就意味着某种东西，并且实际上制定了一个怪诞的数学程序赋予其有效性。
If the tonnage for everything from false teeth to 300,000-H.P. turbines could be computed, one might legitimately say that in America more tons of assorted goods were produced in 1938 than in 1937. What would that tell you? Precisely what the statement says, and no more. You could not without the gravest risk infer from it conclusions of policy or welfare. Suppose the increase was more than accounted for by gross tons of dreadnaughts obsolete before they were launched, tons of tanks, machine guns, and containers of poison gas? Suppose it was accounted for by tons of green lumber instead of seasoned; rank oleo instead of good butter; straw instead of bread? And how about measuring women’s hats and men’s overcoats by the ton? No useful knowledge is presented until we know of what the production consists, its qualities and grades. When we know this, we leave production-in-general behind in the stratosphere.
如果可以计算从假牙到 300,000 马力涡轮机的所有物品的吨位，那么人们可以合理地说，美国 1938 年生产的各种商品的吨数比 1937 年多。这会告诉您什么？正是声明所说的，仅此而已。如果没有最严重的风险，你就无法从中推断出政策或福利的结论。假设增加的数量超过了下水前废弃的无畏舰总吨数、坦克、机枪和毒气容器的总吨数？假设它是由成吨的生木材而不是经过干燥的木材计算的；用橄榄油代替优质黄油；稻草代替面包？那么按吨测量女士帽子和男士大衣怎么样？在我们了解产品的组成、质量和等级之前，我们无法获得有用的知识。当我们知道这一点时，我们就把一般生产抛在了平流层。
One can say in a broad general way that methods of production for most articles are improving because of new inventions; that the production of most things requires fewer hours of labor than were required a generation ago; that the production of food, clothing, shelter, in amounts sufficient to provide for the needs of all families in America or in Europe is today no longer a serious technical problem. Beyond such loose summary statements the term is not only meaningless but dangerous.
人们可以从广义上说，由于新的发明，大多数物品的生产方法都在改进。大多数物品的生产所需的劳动时间比上一代人要少；生产足以满足美国或欧洲所有家庭需要的食物、衣服和住所，如今已不再是一个严重的技术问题。除了如此松散的总结陈述之外，这个术语不仅毫无意义，而且很危险。
I have put “production” through the semantic mill in some detail. It is typical of many terms now confidently used wherever economic affairs are discussed.
我已经详细地对“生产”进行了语义磨炼。这是现在在讨论经济事务时自信地使用的许多术语的典型特征。
Our final exhibit in this stroll with the economists is the resounding phrase, “The American standard of living.” It is much used in conjunction with “the pauper labor of Europe,” and “coolie standards.” It is used for purposes of national self-esteem and to silence reformers who want to improve the living-conditions of Adam1. In 1929 the national income—a dubious figure in itself—was estimated at $80,000,000,000 or thereabouts. There were some 27,000,000 conjectural families in America. Dividing the one by the other, you can arrive at an average of some $3,000 per family. Splendid! A nation of unparalleled prosperity. Yet the careful studies of the Brookings Institution showed two-thirds of all families receiving less than $2,000 in 1929, and one-half less than $1,500. For $2,000 a thrifty family of four persons could just about purchase the theoretical essentials of health and decency—with variations, of course, depending on where the family lived, in the North or the South, in city or country.
我们与经济学家一起漫步的最后一个展品是响亮的短语“美国的生活水平”。它经常与“欧洲的穷苦劳动力”和“苦力标准”结合使用。它的目的是为了民族自尊，并让那些想要改善亚当生活条件的改革者保持沉默。 1929 年，国民收入（这个数字本身就很可疑）估计为 800 亿美元左右。据推测，美国大约有 27,000,000 个家庭。将一项除以另一项，您可以得出每个家庭平均约为 3,000 美元。灿烂！一个无比繁荣的国家。然而，布鲁金斯学会的仔细研究显示，1929 年，三分之二的家庭领取的收入低于 2,000 美元，二分之一的家庭收入低于 1,500 美元。一个节俭的四口之家花 2,000 美元就可以购买理论上的健康和体面必需品——当然，具体情况取决于家庭居住的地方，在北方或南方，在城市或乡村。
The “average income” of a community, as Hogben points out, is without meaning to anyone except the tax-collector, and then only if all incomes are taxed to the same extent. Suppose we have two nations with five families in each:
正如霍格本指出的那样，一个社区的“平均收入”对除了收税者之外的任何人都毫无意义，而且只有在所有收入都按相同程度征税的情况下才有意义。假设我们有两个国家，每个国家都有五个家庭：
Nation A is proud of its high standard of living, averaging twice as high as the pauper standard of Nation B. The Chamber of Commerce prepares a great poster to keep citizens of A contented with their statistical affluence. As a matter of simple mathematics, every family in B is better off financially than 80 per cent of the families in A. Coming down to cases, the United States has a far higher average money income than Denmark, foe instance, but Denmark has no dreadful slums, few tenant farmers, very few families on relief, nothing approaching our appalling poverty. Which is the healthier condition?
A国以其高生活水平而自豪，平均生活水平是B国贫困人口标准的两倍。商会准备了一张很棒的海报，让A国公民对他们统计上的富裕程度感到满意。作为一个简单的数学问题，B 中的每个家庭的经济状况都比 A 中 80% 的家庭要好。 归根结底，美国的平均货币收入远高于丹麦，但丹麦却没有可怕的贫民窟，很少的佃农，很少有家庭靠救济，没有什么比我们可怕的贫困更严重的了。哪种状态更健康？
The findings of the last three chapters can hardly be called “constructive,” to use a battered word. Economic terms and economic concepts are often meaningless and useless as they stand. Well, if they are meaningless, nothing is gained by pretending that they are not. Following the work of Einstein, scientists had to start the job of mopping up their concepts. An economic mopping-up is long overdue. Because terms are muzzy, however, does not mean that nothing can be accomplished on the economic front. Far from it. If we can free ourselves from slavery to terms, a great deal can be accomplished, even before creating better terms.
用一个饱受诟病的词来说，最后三章的发现很难被称为“建设性的”。经济术语和经济概念通常是毫无意义和无用的。好吧，如果它们毫无意义，那么假装它们没有意义就没有任何好处。继爱因斯坦的工作之后，科学家们不得不开始清理他们的概念。经济清理行动早就该进行了。然而，由于条款模糊，并不意味着在经济方面一事无成。离得很远。如果我们能够摆脱条款的束缚，甚至在创造更好的条款之前就可以取得很大的成就。
In Western countries, inanimate energy is now available to produce the food, clothing, shelter, and luxuries which their populations need for survival and modest comfort. If natural resources are sensibly conserved, especially soils and waters, this condition can probably obtain for a long time. These are the limiting factors in the outside world. Only recently has inanimate energy reached a volume where abundant supplies are demonstrably possible. The demonstration can be found for America in the reports of the National Survey of Potential Product Capacity, based on industrial capacity in the year 1929, and published in 1936.
在西方国家，无生命能源现在可以用来生产人民生存和适度舒适所需的食物、衣服、住所和奢侈品。如果自然资源得到合理保护，特别是土壤和水，这种情况可能会持续很长时间。这些都是外界的限制因素。直到最近，无生命的能量才达到了可以提供充足供应的量。美国的这一论证可以在 1936 年发布的国家潜在产品能力调查报告中找到，该调查基于 1929 年的工业能力。
The ill-founded “laws” of the classical economists, by influencing legislators, made industrial workers more miserable than the facts warranted. They helped to block the reduction of hours of labor, helped to postpone wage increases and union organization for collective bargaining. We know today that long hours of work encourage fatigue, spoilage, and inefficiency; we know that relatively high wages tend to keep factories busier, because the mass of the people does the mass of the buying. We know that collective bargaining tends toward industrial peace and steady operation rather than toward strikes, lockouts, and shutdowns. We know these things by direct observation and rough experiment. “Labor in Britain,” says a 1937 London dispatch to the New York Times, “is more organized for collective bargaining, and disputes can be settled more easily than under the less organized conditions prevailing in the United States.”
古典经济学家毫无根据的“法则”通过影响立法者，使产业工人比事实所证明的更加悲惨。他们帮助阻止了劳动时间的减少，帮助推迟了工资上涨和工会组织进行集体谈判。今天我们知道，长时间的工作会导致疲劳、浪费和效率低下。我们知道，相对较高的工资往往会使工厂更加繁忙，因为大量的人民购买了大量的商品。我们知道，集体谈判倾向于工业和平和稳定运营，而不是罢工、停工和停工。我们通过直接观察和粗略的实验来了解这些事情。 1937 年伦敦发给《纽约时报》的一份快讯称，“英国的劳工组织在集体谈判方面更有组织性，而且与美国普遍存在的组织性较差的情况相比，争议更容易得到解决。”
The classicists misinterpreted their world. The bulk of “sound” opinion as reflected in the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Manufacturers Association, the bankers, the surviving classicists on economic faculties, the press, misinterpret the world of today. Arguing from false identifications and unverifiable “laws,” they are doing their best, consciously or unconsciously, to hold down mass income and hold down production, thereby damaging the majority of their fellow citizens, and also damaging themselves. The laws and the principles on which they lean are probably no more tenable than those of the classicists a century ago.
古典主义者误解了他们的世界。美国商会、全国制造商协会、银行家、幸存的经济古典主义者、媒体所反映的大部分“健全”观点都曲解了当今世界。他们以虚假身份和无法证实的“法律”为借口，有意无意地竭尽全力压制群众收入、压制生产，损害了广大同胞，也损害了自己。他们所依据的法则和原则可能并不比一个世纪前的古典主义者的法则和原则更站得住脚。
Similarly, the Marxists are in a shaky position. Their laws have not been validated by operational test, and most of them, I believe, never can be. Russia is now a gigantic laboratory for testing community control of industry and agriculture, but not even the communists pretend that what is going on there is in strict accord with the principles of communism. Trotsky, in one of his rhetorical flights, calls it “a retreat to capitalism.” There is much to be learned from Russia as the experiment develops, but not by doctrinaires.
同样，马克思主义者的地位也岌岌可危。他们的法律还没有经过操作测试的验证，而且我相信，其中大多数法律永远不可能得到验证。俄罗斯现在是一个测试社会对工业和农业控制的巨大实验室，但即使是共产党人也没有假装那里发生的事情完全符合共产主义原则。托洛茨基在他的一次言辞中称其为“向资本主义的倒退”。随着实验的进展，俄罗斯有很多值得学习的地方，但教条主义者却不能。
Similarly, other rigid programs for social reform are in the class of logical exercises rather than demonstrable projects: “social credit,” “single tax” (as a cure-all), “consumers’ co-operation for everything,” “public ownership of all the means of production,” “technocracy,” “the Townsend Plan,” and the rest. One or another might work, but to date no one has established the proof of workability for impartial men to check. If some country like New Zealand adopts an adequate trial period for the theory of “social credit,” five years hence there may be something of value to report.
同样，其他僵化的社会改革方案也属于逻辑练习，而不是可论证的项目：“社会信用”、“单一税收”（万能药）、“消费者合作一切”、“公有制”。所有生产资料”、“技术统治”、“汤森计划”等等。其中一种可能有效，但迄今为止，还没有人能够提供可行的证据以供公正的人检查。如果像新西兰这样的国家对“社会信用”理论采取足够的试用期，那么五年后可能会有一些有价值的报告。
What, then, are we reformers to do? I modestly suggest that we divest our minds of immutable principles and march after tangible results. Use the ballot, social legislation, collective bargaining, co-operative associations, the TVA structure, conservation programs, holding-company regulations, stock-market control, central banking, public ownership—if, as, and when the context of situation, after study, gives promise for an advance. An advance to what? To making Adam1 and his family more comfortable and more secure.
那么，我们改革者应该做什么呢？我谦虚地建议我们放弃一成不变的原则，追求切实的成果。使用投票、社会立法、集体谈判、合作协会、TVA结构、保护计划、控股公司法规、股票市场控制、中央银行、公有制——如果、作为、以及当情况的背景、之后学习，给予进步的希望。提前到什么？让 Adam1 和他的家人更舒适、更安全。
Take for instance the matter of public ownership. The usual method of approaching the question is to enunciate two absolutes:
以公有制为例。解决这个问题的通常方法是阐明两个绝对值：
Public ownership is an evil and always fails.
公有制是邪恶的，总是失败的。
Public ownership is a blessing and always succeeds.
公有制是一种福气，并且总是成功的。
Then we take sides, become very emotional, and collect endless statistics supporting (1) and condemning (2), or supporting (2) and blasting (1). Then we stage debates, write letters to the papers, prepare editorials, learned pamphlets, and books. The harder we work and the angrier we become, the more difficult it is to find any foundation for agreement. So we talk in the dark, write in the dark, fight in the dark about two nonexistent principles.
然后我们就偏袒一方，变得非常情绪化，并收集无穷无尽的统计数据支持（1）和谴责（2），或者支持（2）和爆炸（1）。然后我们举行辩论、给报纸写信、准备社论、学术小册子和书籍。我们越努力，越愤怒，就越难找到共识的基础。所以我们在黑暗中谈论，在黑暗中写作，在黑暗中为两个不存在的原则而斗争。
What is happening in the real world? Private companies fail to provide essential service in situation A. Public enterprise makes a gorgeous mess of situation B. Technological conditions change and demand public action in situation C, where no private company is functioning at all. Government takes over a private utility at fancy prices in situation D, and no matter how efficiently it operates, the initial capital charge forces it to show a loss. And so on and so forth. There are as many inferences warranted as there are situations, and no two situations are exactly alike.
现实世界中正在发生什么？在情况 A 中，私营公司无法提供基本服务。公共企业将情况 B 弄得一团糟。在情况 C 中，技术条件发生变化，要求公共采取行动，此时私营公司根本无法运作。在情况 D 中，政府以高价接管私人公用事业公司，无论其运营效率如何，初始资本支出都会迫使其出现亏损。等等等等。有多少情况就有多少种需要进行的推论，而且没有两种情况是完全相同的。
Reformers with an understanding of semantics will refuse to be involved in a battle of goblins. They will get the facts of each situation and base their action thereon. They will throw principles out of the window except the fundamental one of trying to make citizens more comfortable in a specific situation. They will talk, write, vote, agitate, march, from this point of view. They will cease to be for or against the principle of “public ownership,” and will only be for or against a given action in a given case. So they cannot be bundled up and ticketed as “ists” or supporters of “isms.”
了解语义的改革者将拒绝卷入妖精之战。他们将了解每种情况的事实并据此采取行动。他们会把原则抛到九霄云外，除了试图让公民在特定情况下更加舒适的基本原则之外。他们将从这个角度说话、写作、投票、鼓动、游行。他们将不再支持或反对“公有制”原则，而只会支持或反对特定案件中的特定行动。因此，他们不能被捆绑起来并被贴上“主义者”或“主义”支持者的标签。
If a private company at a given time and place is furnishing adequate employment, working conditions, and output at a figure which is not exorbitant in terms of dividends, for heaven’s sake leave it alone! The American Telephone and Telegraph Company may be such a concern—with a question-mark on the dividend characteristic. But if the service is poor, the rates astronomical, or both, let us join a movement to hammer it into public usefulness or take it over. The Westchester Power and Light Company comes to mind. I paid this company 15 cents per kilowatt hour for years.
如果一家私营公司在特定的时间和地点提供了足够的就业、工作条件，并且产出的数字在股息方面并不过高，那么看在老天爷的份上别管它了！美国电话电报公司可能就是这样一个问题——其股息特征还存在疑问。但是，如果服务很差，价格很高，或者两者兼而有之，那么让我们加入一场运动，将其投入公共用途或将其接管。我想到了威彻斯特电力和照明公司。多年来我向这家公司支付每千瓦时 15 美分的费用。
Thus the argument shifts from Wonderland to the best method of getting some specific job done here on earth. When enough of us adopt the approach, actual jobs can get done. We will not try to bring everything into line on principle; we will first try to bring into line what is breaking down. We will clear our minds of dogmas about “individualism” and “socialism.” We will get away from “either . . . or” as from a pair of rattlesnakes. No one wants “socialization” as such—one cannot eat a word. One wants for himself and his fellows a good job, good food, a good house to live in, a car, and a chance to send the children to high school or college. To obtain these things it may be necessary to fight. All right, let us fight. But let the fight be on the real situation. Let us see clearly a possibility of success. And let it be known that we are going after adequate goods, services, jobs for all, rather than after “classless societies” and “co-operative commonwealths.” Within the broad limits set by the technical arts and natural resources we can have any kind of economic system that enough of us want.
因此，争论从仙境转向在地球上完成某些特定工作的最佳方法。当我们有足够多的人采用这种方法时，实际的工作就可以完成。我们不会试图让一切都遵循原则；我们将首先尝试使出现问题的情况恢复正常。我们将清除头脑中关于“个人主义”和“社会主义”的教条。我们将摆脱“要么……”。 。 。或”如来自一对响尾蛇。没有人想要这样的“社交”——一个字都不能吃。一个人希望自己和他的同伴有一份好工作、一顿美餐、一所好房子、一辆汽车，以及送孩子上高中或大学的机会。为了获得这些东西，可能需要战斗。好吧，我们来战斗吧。但让战斗根据实际情况进行。让我们看清成功的可能性。让人们知道，我们追求的是为所有人提供充足的商品、服务和就业机会，而不是追求“无阶级社会”和“合作联邦”。在技术艺术和自然资源所设定的广泛限制内，我们可以拥有足够多的人想要的任何类型的经济体系。
Reformers should take warning from that Austrian general who had great contempt for Napoleon. While it was true that Napoleon consistently defeated him, it was done counter to the laws of military strategy!
改革者应该向这位极其蔑视拿破仑的奥地利将军提出警告。虽然拿破仑确实不断地击败了他，但这却违背了军事战略的法则！
Chapter XVII
第十七章
ROUND AND ROUND WITH THE JUDGES
与评委们周旋
MALINOWSKI had to live with Trobriand Islander in their native environment to find out what their words meant. Walton Hamilton and Douglas Adair in theii book The Power to Govern have visited the Philadelphia of 1787 in an attempt to find out what the words of the American Constitution meant to the men who framed it. They could not see and touch, as did Malinowski, but they did the next best thing. They examined the written records and diaries of those who participated in the discussions; they reconstructed the economic conditions of the late eighteenth century in America; they analyzed the common usages of words in the contexts of the period.
马里诺夫斯基必须与特罗布里恩岛民一起生活在他们的家乡，才能弄清楚他们的话的含义。沃尔顿·汉密尔顿 (Walton Hamilton) 和道格拉斯·阿代尔 (Douglas Adair) 在《治理的权力》一书中访问了 1787 年的费城，试图找出美国宪法的文字对制定宪法的人意味着什么。他们无法像马林诺夫斯基那样看到和触摸，但他们做了退而求其次的事情。他们检查了参与讨论的人的书面记录和日记；他们重建了美国十八世纪末的经济状况；他们分析了该时期语境中词语的常见用法。
The results of this expedition in time are as illuminating as Malinowski’s expedition in space. They throw a floodlight upon Constitutional law as it has developed since that memorable convention, and upon the contemporary struggle between the executive and the judicial branches of the Government. In this long perspective the heated debates of today become all but meaningless.
这次时间探险的结果与马林诺夫斯基的太空探险一样具有启发性。它们重点关注自那次令人难忘的大会以来宪法的发展，以及当代政府行政部门和司法部门之间的斗争。从长远来看，今天的激烈争论几乎变得毫无意义。
In his dissenting opinion on the Social Security Act, Mr. Justice McReynolds said:
麦克雷诺兹法官在他对《社会保障法》的反对意见中表示：
We should keep in mind that we are living under a written Constitution. No volume of words and no citation of irrelevant statistics and no appeal to feelings of humanity can expand the powers granted to Congress. Neither can we, by attempts to paint a white rose red, view the situation differently from that seen by the Fathers of the Constitution.
我们应该记住，我们生活在成文宪法之下。任何长篇大论、任何不相干的统计数据的引用、任何人性的诉求都无法扩大赋予国会的权力。我们也不能试图把白玫瑰涂成红色，从而以与宪法之父们不同的方式看待局势。
What does the Justice mean by this? I take it he means that the Fathers saw a situation A. They wrote it down. Today we have but to pick it up and apply it to the A of this year. What settled A1787 will settle A1938. Ah, if life were but so simple! “If you think,” said Thomas Reed Powell, “that you can think about a thing, inextricably attached to something else, without thinking of the thing it is attached to, then you have a legal mind.”
法官这句话是什么意思？我认为他的意思是教父们看到了一种情况A。他们把它写了下来。今天我们要把它应用到今年的 A 中。 A1787 的解决将会解决 A1938。啊，生活要是这么简单该多好啊！ “如果你认为，”托马斯·里德·鲍威尔说，“你可以思考一件事，与另一件事密不可分地联系在一起，而不考虑它所联系的事物，那么你就有了法律思维。”
Mr. Justice Roberts is even more precise. When an Act of Congress, he tells us, is challenged in the courts as not conforming to the Constitution, judges have only one duty—“to lay the article of the Constitution which is involved beside the statute which is challenged, and to decide whether the latter squares with the former.” It is like a problem in Euclid: Is the square A or not-A? And yet not like a problem in Euclid, for students of geometry do not split five to four, six to three, eight to one, as to whether one square is of approximately the same size as the next. They measure and agree. The members of the Supreme Court are in chronic disagreement. We need look no farther to know that the techniques employed, however wise or human, are not dependable in the scientific sense.
罗伯茨大法官的说法更加准确。他告诉我们，当国会的一项法案因不符合宪法而在法庭上受到质疑时，法官只有一项职责——“将涉及的宪法条款与受到质疑的法规放在一起，并决定是否后者与前者相乘。”这就像欧几里得中的一个问题：正方形是A还是非A？然而，与欧几里得的问题不同的是，对于几何学生来说，对于一个正方形的大小是否与下一个正方形的大小大致相同，对于几何学生来说，不会将五比四，六比三，八比一。他们衡量并达成一致。最高法院成员长期存在分歧。我们不用再进一步了解，所采用的技术，无论多么明智或人性化，在科学意义上都是不可靠的。
In 1787 the American colonies, after winning the war for independence, had set up a loose confederation of states. Tariff walls between the states, widespread bankruptcy, depreciated currency, the decline of oversea trade, problems of inland navigation, rivalries and jealousies, were threatening to wreck the stability of the young republic. The states were invited to send delegates to Philadelphia to meet the crisis. The Constitutional Convention was called to deal with a specific situation.
1787年，美洲殖民地赢得独立战争后，建立了松散的国家联盟。各州之间的关税壁垒、普遍破产、货币贬值、海外贸易衰退、内河航运问题、竞争和嫉妒，正在威胁着破坏这个年轻共和国的稳定。各州受邀派代表前往费城应对危机。召开制宪会议是为了处理具体情况。
What has been called a “handicraft” or “scarcity” economy was the order of the day. Watt’s steam engine had not crossed the Atlantic. Most goods were grown and fabricated on the farm for home consumption. Ninety per cent of all heads of families were farmers, forest workers, fishermen, or hunters. Itinerant craftsmen—shoemakers, tinsmiths, masons—passed from farm to farm. There were a few flour mills, sawmills, forges, operated by water power; some small shoe factories in Lynn, textile looms in Providence, knit-stocking works in Germantown, metal shops in Connecticut. These shops made goods for the “market” in contrast with the “bespoken” goods of the craftsmen. Roads were abominable, and transport by sailing packet was slow and uncertain. When winds were adverse it might take ten days to go from Bridgeport to New York.
所谓的“手工业”或“稀缺”经济已成为当时的主流。瓦特的蒸汽机尚未横渡大西洋。大多数商品都是在农场种植和制造的，供家庭消费。百分之九十的户主是农民、森林工人、渔民或猎人。巡回工匠——鞋匠、锡匠、石匠——从一个农场传到另一个农场。有一些面粉厂、锯木厂、锻造厂，靠水力运转。林恩的一些小鞋厂、普罗维登斯的纺织机、日耳曼敦的针织袜厂、康涅狄格州的金属店。这些商店为“市场”生产商品，与工匠的“定制”商品形成鲜明对比。道路条件恶劣，海运包裹运输缓慢且不稳定。当风势不利时，从布里奇波特到纽约可能需要十天的时间。
Vessels built in the shipyards of New England ran to the West Indies, Europe, Africa, China, carrying rice, tobacco, and indigo, bringing back imported necessities, luxuries, and slaves. These activities were symbolized by the word “commerce.” The Constitutional Convention was called to bring order into commercial affairs, to ease the strangulation of commerce caused by state tariffs, to circumvent the hampering effects of British commercial policies. The spirit of dialectic and theory sat lightly upon the young men in Philadelphia—half of them were under forty; they wanted to get things done.
新英格兰造船厂建造的船只运往西印度群岛、欧洲、非洲、中国，运载大米、烟草和靛蓝，带回进口的必需品、奢侈品和奴隶。这些活动以“商业”一词为象征。制宪会议的目的是使商业事务恢复秩序，缓解国家关税对商业的束缚，规避英国商业政策的阻碍作用。辩证法和理论的精神对费城的年轻人来说并不重要——其中一半在四十岁以下；他们想要把事情做好。
An American gentleman of 1787 encountered different Thingumbobs from those encountered by a gentleman of today. His experience was vastly dissimilar; his meanings accordingly were different. He looked out upon a world that seemed to him physically larger than the world seems to us. Its “times” were longer, its “spaces” greater. New York was as far in time from Philadelphia as California is now. He had never seen a street well lighted at night, never seen a factory with smoking chimneys, never seen wires on a pole, never talked to anyone he could not touch with his hand by a few swift steps. A nation where farmers or peasants were not in the overwhelming majority would have been inconceivable to him. If he should come knocking at your door across the years, and you should give him a ride in your motorcar at a moderate speed, he would almost certainly die of fright. He had never seen a clean hospital, never had a tooth pulled without shattering agony. When he was ill, his doctor lowered his resistance by bleeding him. He never had to catch a train. He had never seen a photograph of anyone or anything. Mr. Franklin kept on talking about electricity in the sky, but it meant little to this gentleman of 1787.
1787 年的一位美国绅士遇到的 Thingumbobs 与今天的绅士所遇到的不同。他的经历截然不同。因此他的含义也不同。他所看到的世界在他看来比我们眼中的世界还要大。它的“时间”更长，它的“空间”更大。纽约距费城的时间与现在加利福尼亚距的距离一样远。他从未见过夜晚灯火通明的街道，从未见过烟囱冒着烟的工厂，从未见过电线杆上的电线，从未与手无法快速几步触及的人交谈过。一个农民或农民不占绝大多数的国家对他来说是不可想象的。如果他跨年来敲你的门，你开着你的汽车以中等速度载他，他几乎肯定会被吓死。他从来没有见过干净的医院，拔牙也从来没有不经受过极大的痛苦。当他生病时，他的医生通过给他放血来降低他的抵抗力。他从来不需要赶火车。他从未见过任何人或任何事物的照片。富兰克林先生一直在谈论天空中的电，但这对这位 1787 年的绅士来说意义不大。
It is natural to assume that where words abide, meanings remain. Yet fifteen decades of cultural change lie between us and the words of the Constitution. What we now call “industry” the founding Fathers called “art.” A “machine” was a symbol for a piece of workmanship composed with art to produce motion. It was also the “part which the deities, angels, or demons perform in solving some knotty difficulty.” A “manufacturer” symbolized a man who made things with his hands. The concept included, of course, the farmer. “Credit” was the symbol for trust reposed in the debtor. The vast machinery of Modern credit transactions was unknown. A “banker” was a tradesman who dealt in money, not long removed from the goldsmith-banker. “Business” was beginning to be spelled with an i, but still meant busy-ness in most contexts. “Industry” symbolized the commendable behavior of ant and bee. “Traffick” had a vulgar connotation, as in “the slave traffick” or “traffick with hussies.” “Trade” was more respectable. Large merchants as well as petty shopkeepers were “in trade.” But “commerce” was held a stately word, symbol for all goods that moved. Mr. Justice Holmes was aware how these symbols had shifted. In Towne v. Eisner he said:
人们很自然地认为，词语存在的地方，意义也存在。然而，十五年的文化变迁距离我们和宪法的生效还有很长的路要走。我们现在所说的“工业”，开国元勋们称之为“艺术”。 “机器”是一件由艺术组成的能产生运动的工艺品的象征。这也是“神灵、天使或恶魔在解决某些棘手难题时所扮演的角色”。 “制造商”象征着用手制造东西的人。当然，这个概念也包括农民。 “信用”是对债务人信任的象征。现代信用交易的庞大机制尚不为人所知。 “银行家”是指从事货币交易的商人，与金匠银行家的区别不久。 “Business”开始用 i 拼写，但在大多数情况下仍然意味着忙碌。 “勤奋”象征着蚂蚁和蜜蜂的可贵行为。 “贩卖”有粗俗的含义，如“贩卖奴隶”或“贩卖妓女”。 “贸易”更受尊重。大商人和小店主都在“做生意”。但“商业”是一个庄严的词，是所有流动商品的象征。福尔摩斯法官先生知道这些符号是如何发生变化的。在汤恩诉艾斯纳案中，他说：
It is not necessarily true that income means the same thing in the Constitution and the [current] Act A word is not a crystal, transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.
宪法和[现行]法案中收入的含义不一定相同。一个词不是水晶，透明且不变；它是一个活生生的思想的外壳，根据使用环境和时间的不同，颜色和内容可能会有很大差异。
The ruling economic policy of 1787, both in the young republic and abroad, went under the label of “mercantilism.” By this was meant two things. Governments must strive—and did strive—to ship out more goods than, they shipped in, and so build up a reserve of metal and specie. Money was indeed substance in those days. It was thought better and more secure to have metal in the vaults than goods in the house. To achieve this so-called favorable balance of trade, it was essential that the governments should take strong and active direction of commercial activities. Men did not speak of “economics,” but of “political economy,” where state and commerce were joined to a common end. The governments of England, Spain, France, Holland, dispatched their trading ships and men-of-war to the four comers of the earth under a rigorous system of planned national commerce. It was the duty of the young republic to emulate them.
1787 年，无论是在这个年轻的共和国还是在国外，占主导地位的经济政策都被贴上了“重商主义”的标签。这有两层含义。各国政府必须努力——而且也确实努力——发出比输入的货物更多的货物，从而建立金属和货币储备。在那个时代，金钱确实是物质。人们认为，将金属存放在金库中比存放在房屋中的物品更好、更安全。为了实现这种所谓的贸易顺差，政府必须对商业活动采取强有力和积极的指导。人们谈论的不是“经济”，而是“政治经济”，即国家和商业为了一个共同的目标而结合在一起。英国、西班牙、法国、荷兰政府在严格的国家商业计划体系下，向地球的四个角落派遣了商船和战舰。年轻的共和国有责任效仿他们。
“The paternalism of the government extended to agriculture and commerce.” This state control was no theory; it was the way strong nations prospered, a condition as natural to the Fathers as state highways and traffic signals to ourselves. Most of the men who wrote the Constitution subscribed to mercantilism so defined. Concern for commerce runs throughout their debates. Contemporary documents examined by Walton Hamilton show strong evidence of an interest to endow the new Federal Government with power to formulate a policy for the national economy, extending over trade, manufacturing, agriculture, navigation, internal improvements. The term “commerce alone had competency for so high a verbal duty.” Thus was the famous commerce clause born.
“政府的家长作风延伸到了农业和商业。”这种国家控制并非理论，而是一种理论。这是强国繁荣的方式，对先辈来说这是自然条件，就像国道和交通信号对我们来说一样自然。大多数宪法起草者都认同如此定义的重商主义。对商业的担忧贯穿了他们的辩论。沃尔顿·汉密尔顿审查的当代文件显示，有强有力的证据表明，有兴趣赋予新联邦政府制定国民经济政策的权力，范围涵盖贸易、制造业、农业、航海和内部改进。 “只有商业才有能力承担如此高的口头责任。”著名的商业条款就这样诞生了。
The Constitution as conceived by its framers was no narrow bill of particulars, but a broad instrument to give the newly created Federal Government power to deal with a serious crisis, and to lead the nation forward along mercantilist lines. The founders wrote no intricate body of rules, no involved code, no inflexible corpus of Constitutional law. They laid down a structure of how the officials of the Government should be elected or appointed, and then granted them the most general powers. It is interesting to note that some functions were allotted to the states because of the sorry condition of the roads. Federal administrators could not be expected to surmount the mud or sand.
宪法制定者所设想的宪法并不是狭隘的细节法案，而是一项广泛的工具，赋予新成立的联邦政府处理严重危机的权力，并领导国家沿着重商主义路线前进。创始人没有制定复杂的规则，没有复杂的法典，也没有僵化的宪法体系。他们制定了政府官员如何选举或任命的结构，然后授予他们最一般的权力。有趣的是，由于道路状况不佳，一些职能被分配给各州。不能指望联邦行政官员能克服泥沙。
Today, the words in their contexts, the state of knowledge, the technical arts, the ends of public policy, have changed beyond recognition. Industrial workers, tenant farmers, women wage-earners; problems of hours, wages, competition, monopoly, insecurity, unemployment—these have come into a picture which was bare canvas in 1787. The rugged individualism which good citizens today read into the hearts of the founding Fathers was not an accepted principle in 1787. Pioneers were rugged and independent, consuming what they produced with little benefit of markets. But the Fathers were well-to-do gentlemen of the mercantilist persuasion, determined to build a strong state for the control of commerce and the capture of a favorable balance of trade. The ideals of laissez faire, free competition, a minimum of governmental interference, enlightened selfishness, were not to make their appearance for fifty years. While Adam Smith in England had laid a foundation for a philosophy of Individualism at the time of the American Revolution, he was still mercantilist enough to counsel governments rigorously to plan their oversea trade. America was a generation and more behind England in adopting the factory system. Most of the men at Philadelphia had never heard the term “laissez faire.” The doctrine of selfishness, however enlightened, would probably have shocked them. Furthermore, the eighteenth century had “no lexicon of legalisms extracted from the law reports in which judicial usage lies in a world apart from the ordinary affairs of life.” The founding Fathers wrote the Constitution in the everyday language of 1787 to meet a situation. The situation was met and the crisis surmounted. For this they merit our undying gratitude.
今天，词语的语境、知识状况、技术艺术、公共政策的目的，已经发生了面目全非的变化。产业工人、佃农、女工薪人员；工时、工资、竞争、垄断、不安全感、失业等问题——这些在 1787 年还只是一幅画布。今天，好公民在开国元勋心中所理解的粗犷的个人主义在 1787 年并不是一个被接受的原则。先驱们是坚强而独立的，他们消费他们生产的东西，但市场几乎没有带来什么好处。但教父们都是信奉重商主义的富裕绅士，决心建立一个强大的国家来控制商业并获得有利的贸易平衡。自由放任、自由竞争、最少的政府干预、开明的自私等理想在五十年后才出现。尽管英国的亚当·斯密在美国革命时期为个人主义哲学奠定了基础，但他仍然是重商主义者，足以建议政府严格规划其海外贸易。美国在采用工厂制度方面比英国落后一代甚至更多。费城的大多数人从未听说过“自由放任”这个词。自私的教义无论多么开明，都可能会让他们感到震惊。此外，十八世纪“没有从法律报告中提取的法律主义词汇，其中司法的使用与日常生活事务截然不同”。开国元勋们在 1787 年用日常语言编写了宪法，以应对某种情况。情况得到了满足，危机也被克服了。为此，他们值得我们无尽的感激。
What does the Constitution mean today? It gives some wise rules for government machinery, and some not so wise—the Electoral College for the choosing of a President is an example of the latter. It tells how sane men in 1787 thought their thirteen states should be governed, with broad federal powers over commerce and national welfare. It strengthens those who believe that policies made or endorsed by a majority of citizens through the ballot are superior to policies made by king, dictator, or junta. It emphasizes the freedom of speech, press, and assemblage, which most Americans and Englishmen prize highly in certain contexts. Beyond this, its power today is largely ritualistic, and so without much useful meaning for practical problems.
宪法在今天意味着什么？它为政府机构提供了一些明智的规则，也有一些不那么明智的规则——选举总统的选举团就是后者的一个例子。它讲述了 1787 年理智的人们如何认为他们的 13 个州应该受到联邦的广泛管理，对商业和国家福利拥有广泛的权力。它强化了那些相信大多数公民通过投票制定或认可的政策优于国王、独裁者或军政府制定的政策的人的观点。它强调言论、新闻和集会自由，在某些情况下，大多数美国人和英国人都高度重视这些自由。除此之外，它今天的力量很大程度上是仪式性的，因此对于实际问题没有太多有用的意义。
Its virtues are already in our folkways. If we voted tomorrow to rescind the entire instrument, life would go on. From the semantic point of view, we cannot expect the meaning of written constitutions to survive extensive changes in culture. Unless the words are given new concepts in the light of new conditions, they will be used blindly, rigidly, and will weaken the power of governments to govern. This is one reason why the unwritten British constitution provides a more flexible and practical instrument than the American.
它的美德已经融入我们的民俗之中。如果我们明天投票废除整个文书，生活还会继续。从语义的角度来看，我们不能指望成文宪法的含义能够在文化的广泛变化中幸存下来。如果不根据新的情况赋予新的概念，就会盲目地、僵化地使用这些词，从而削弱政府的执政能力。这就是为什么英国不成文宪法提供了比美国宪法更灵活、更实用的文书的原因之一。
Reformers might urge, on the basis of Dr. Hamilton’s analysis, that we should give to the commerce clause today a concept similar to that employed by the Fathers. This would operate to override many of the decisions of the Supreme Court where the words “interstate” and “intrastate” are woven into a stupendous verbal muddle. I am unable to follow such reasoning. We no longer live in a world dominated by mercantilist ideas. We have no more warrant to copy the Fathers in their commerce concepts than to copy their canal-building or their slave trade. The point to emphasize is that when members of the Supreme Court narrow the power of Congress to control commerce and cite the Constitution as their authority, they are not following the concepts of the Fathers, but saying what they want Congress to do, and using the Constitution as a kind of sacred war club. If this sounds scandalous, remember that Mr. Justice Hughes once remarked with commendable realism that the Constitution is what the judges say it is, while Theodore Roosevelt, when asked about a pending decision, said, “It depends upon whether Judge—comes down heads or tails.” Do the majority of Americans want Congress to frame policy, or the Supreme Court to frame policy? This is the real question at issue today.
根据汉密尔顿博士的分析，改革者可能会敦促我们今天应该赋予商业条款一个类似于父辈所使用的概念。这将推翻最高法院的许多判决，在这些判决中，“州际”和“州内”这两个词被编织成一个惊人的言语混乱。我无法理解这样的推理。我们不再生活在一个由重商主义思想主导的世界。我们没有理由效仿先辈们的商业理念，就像效仿他们的运河建设或奴隶贸易一样。需要强调的一点是，当最高法院成员缩小国会控制商业的权力并援引宪法作为自己的权威时，他们并不是遵循教父们的理念，而是说他们希望国会做什么，并利用宪法宪法是一种神圣的战争俱乐部。如果这听起来很可耻，请记住，休斯大法官先生曾经以值得称赞的现实主义评论说，宪法就是法官所说的那样，而西奥多·罗斯福在被问及待决决定时说：“这取决于法官是否会低下头来”或尾巴。”大多数美国人希望国会制定政策，还是最高法院制定政策？这是今天讨论的真正问题。
It may be that the majority opinion of nine men, secure in life tenure, furnishes a better guide for social policy than the majority opinion of legislators elected for relatively short terms. The record of what the nine men have actually done in the past fifty years has convinced me that I would rather trust my fortunes to the legislators, but that is another question. What we are considering here is the infallibility of “justice,” the widespread belief that we live under a government of laws and not of men, and the idea that judges can fit the meanings of the Constitution of 1787 to the meanings of current legislation as one fits together a picture puzzle.
九名终身任期稳定的男性的多数意见可能比任期相对较短的立法者的多数意见为社会政策提供更好的指导。这九个人在过去五十年里的实际所作所为的记录让我相信，我宁愿把自己的命运托付给立法者，但那是另一个问题了。我们在这里考虑的是“正义”的绝对正确性，人们普遍相信我们生活在法治政府而不是人治政府之下，以及法官可以将 1787 年宪法的含义与现行立法的含义相匹配的想法：一个可以拼成一幅图片拼图。
Once men sought to settle personal disputes with sticks and swords. It was a method costly to life and limb. Legal machinery was gradually substituted, where an arbitrator called a judge, or a group of arbitrators called a jury, listened to the claims of the disputants and rendered a decision. This saved hospital bills and grievances nursed because the other man had a bigger stick. Civilized living is impossible without machinery to settle disputes. If we accept this, and also accept the statement that legal decisions are always made by human beings, we can admire those who assume the difficult task of finding the facts and rendering decisions, and be grateful to them. But when we begin to think of them as priests, speaking not out of their own experience but as sounding boards for a Law which is beyond human frailty, then this necessary machinery is converted into a branch of demonology. It is as though an umpire in a baseball game were regarded not as a fellow citizen doing the best he could, but as an automaton receiving a signal from on high before he cried “Ball!” or “Strike!” The irritated fan in the bleachers sometimes does not hesitate to throw a pop bottle at an umpire whose decisions appear to be biased or consistently out of line with the facts. I do not recommend throwing pop bottles at judges, but there is a lot in the pop-bottle point of view. A Supreme Court judge is just as human as a baseball umpire.
曾经，人们试图用棍棒和剑来解决个人纠纷。这是一种以生命和肢体为代价的方法。法律机制逐渐被取代，由一名仲裁员（称为法官）或一群仲裁员（称为陪审团）听取争议双方的主张并做出裁决。这节省了医院的费用，也减少了因另一个人有更大的棍子而引起的不满。如果没有解决争端的机制，文明生活就不可能实现。如果我们接受这一点，也接受法律决定总是由人做出的说法，我们就可以钦佩那些承担查明事实和作出决定的艰巨任务的人，并感激他们。但是，当我们开始将他们视为牧师时，他们的发言不是出于自己的经验，而是作为超越人类弱点的法律的传声筒，那么这一必要的机制就转变为恶魔学的一个分支。这就好像棒球比赛中的裁判不被视为尽其所能的同胞，而是被视为一个机器人，在他喊出“球！”之前收到来自上层的信号。或“罢工！”看台上愤怒的球迷有时会毫不犹豫地向裁判扔汽水瓶，因为裁判的决定似乎有偏见或始终不符合事实。我不建议向评委扔汽水瓶，但汽水瓶的观点有很多。最高法院的法官和棒球裁判一样都是人。
Early in its history, legal machinery became entangled with the ghosts of divine sanction, and judges in their robes walked as solemnly as priests of the church in theirs. The rules which the judges accumulated to help them in their work were made into the verbal corpus of the Law. Today we have actual judges trying actual cases and dispensing decisions which are often fair and workable. Above and beyond we have the Law, the Constitution, and the Supreme Court, which are spiritual symbols for the kind of world we would like to have. When actual judges become entangled with symbolic judges, and essential rules of legal procedure become entangled with the Law, then we may have on the one hand a Supreme Court crisis, and on the other many unfair and inaccurate decisions calling loudly for a shower of mental pop bottles. As in the case of philosophy, formal logic, and classical economics, the Law then becomes a heavy handicap to Adam1 in his attempt to come to terms with the world outside.
在其历史的早期，法律机制与神圣制裁的幽灵纠缠在一起，穿着长袍的法官与穿着长袍的教会牧师一样庄严地行走。法官为帮助他们工作而积累的规则被写入了法律的文字语料库。今天，我们有真正的法官审理实际案件并做出往往是公平且可行的决定。除此之外，我们还有法律、宪法和最高法院，它们是我们想要拥有的世界的精神象征。当现实的法官与象征性的法官纠缠在一起，法律程序的基本规则与法律纠缠在一起时，我们一方面可能会面临最高法院的危机，另一方面也会出现许多不公平、不准确的判决，亟待精神洗礼。汽水瓶。与哲学、形式逻辑和古典经济学的情况一样，法律成为亚当试图与外部世界达成协议的严重障碍。
It was no less an authority than Blackstone who said: “This, then, is the general signification of the Law: a rule of action dictated by some superior being.” Jerome Frank notes that the beginnings of such axioms are to be found in the fear of human judgment and the demand for a magical source of decisions. The early modes of trial—the ordeal, the judicial duel, the oath, compurgation—were considered to be uncontaminated by human elements. The judgment was the judgment of the supernatural. “Slowly, oh, so slowly, there emerges a tolerance of a human being as the proper decider of issues. Legal history might be written in terms of the increase of that tolerance. But, while in practice the human decider becomes more and more apparent, in theory the old fear, the old intolerance remains.”
与布莱克斯通一样，权威人士也说过：“这就是法律的一般含义：由某个更高的存在所规定的行动规则。”杰罗姆·弗兰克（Jerome Frank）指出，此类公理的起源可以在对人类判断的恐惧和对决策的神奇来源的需求中找到。早期的审判模式——严酷考验、司法决斗、宣誓、赎罪——被认为没有受到人为因素的污染。审判是超自然的审判。 “慢慢地，哦，太慢了，人们开始容忍人类作为问题的正确决定者。法律史可能会以这种宽容的增加来书写。但是，虽然在实践中人类决策者变得越来越明显，但在理论上，旧的恐惧、旧的不宽容仍然存在。”
The human element, says Frank, in the administration of justice by judges is irrepressible. The more we try to conceal the fact that judges are swayed by prejudices, passions, and weaknesses, the more likely we are to augment the fact. Legal systems have been reared on the beliefs (1) that a judge centers his attention on impersonal rules of law; (2) that his decision is the product of his application of those rules to the facts of the case; and (3) that as a consequence the human element is practically boiled away—as if one were working out a problem by following the rules of algebra. These beliefs enhance the bad effects of the judges’ prejudices, passions, and weaknesses, for they tend to block self-examination by judges of their own mental processes. Judges develop a kind of oracle complex. “It has become compulsory and respectable for judges to give explanations of their decisions in so artificial a manner as to insure, to the maximum, the concealment from the judges and from others of judicial biases and predilections.”
弗兰克说，法官在司法中的人为因素是不可抑制的。我们越是试图掩盖法官受到偏见、激情和弱点影响的事实，我们就越有可能扩大这一事实。法律制度是建立在以下信念之上的：(1)法官将注意力集中在客观的法律规则上； (2) 他的决定是他将这些规则应用于案件事实的结果； (3) 结果，人的因素实际上被排除了——就好像一个人通过遵循代数规则来解决问题一样。这些信念加剧了法官的偏见、激情和弱点的不良影响，因为它们往往会阻碍法官对自己的心理过程进行自我审视。法官发展出一种甲骨文复合体。 “法官以如此人为的方式对其判决作出解释已成为强制性和受人尊敬的，以确保最大限度地向法官和其他人隐瞒司法偏见和偏好。”
Many factors affect judicial decisions, of which the rules of law constitute but one. Sometimes the rules have considerable influence, sometimes they have little. How much effect they will have in a given case is unknown. “Knowledge of all the legal rules now in existence will not enable anyone to define most legal rights and duties with a high decree of accuracy.” Future decisions are not predictable—as the famous legal corps of the American Liberty League is well aware. What the great lawyers held to be surely unconstitutional turned out to be constitutional. Indeed if the law were sure and certain, Supreme Courts would not split five to lour, for the law would reveal itself.
影响司法判决的因素有很多，法律规则只是其中之一。有时规则的影响很大，有时则影响很小。它们在特定情况下会产生多大影响尚不清楚。 “了解现有的所有法律规则并不能让任何人高度准确地定义大多数法律权利和义务。”未来的决定是不可预测的——著名的美国自由联盟法律团队深知这一点。伟大的律师们认为肯定违宪的东西，结果却是合宪的。事实上，如果法律是确定无疑的，最高法院就不会分裂五个人，因为法律会自行显现。
Chancellor Kent of New York State, a great legal authority, in a charming burst of frankness once wrote: “I saw where justice lay, and the moral issue decided the court half the time. I then sat down to search the authorities. . . . I might once in a while be embarrassed by a technical rule, but I almost always found principles suited to my view of the case.” The learned judge used his best judgment, came to a decision, and then ransacked the fat books for authority to support him. He almost always found it. I would be willing to take his decision, if he were a good judge, without the ornament of citations. The decision constitutes the reality of legal machinery; the citations contribute to the magic.
伟大的法律权威、纽约州州长肯特曾以一种迷人的坦率写道：“我看到了正义的所在，而道德问题有一半是由法庭决定的。然后我坐下来搜查当局。 。 。 。有时我可能会因技术规则而感到尴尬，但我几乎总能找到适合我对案件看法的原则。”这位博学的法官运用了他最好的判断力，做出了决定，然后翻遍了厚厚的书籍，寻找权威来支持他。他几乎总能找到它。如果他是一个好的法官，我愿意接受他的决定，而不需要任何引文的装饰。该决定构成法律机制的现实；引用有助于魔法。
A judge cites precedent, but he must first decide which precedents to cite. There are many varieties in the barrel. In the AAA case in 1936, the Supreme Court majority picked one set of precedents and the minority another. The majority held that a bonus to a farmer was like paying a shoe-manufacturer to limit his output; the minority held that it was like giving a federal grant to a state college for courses in agriculture. Precedents are based on identification of this case with that case. A is A. If no two peas are quite alike, what must we say of legal cases? Precedents also enable judges to put upon the shoulders of the past the responsibility for personal decisions they make in the present.
法官引用先例，但他必须首先决定引用哪些先例。桶内品种繁多。在 1936 年的 AAA 案中，最高法院多数派选择了一套先例，少数派选择了另一套先例。大多数人认为，向农民发放奖金就像付钱给鞋制造商以限制他的产量；少数派认为，这就像向州立大学提供农业课程联邦拨款一样。先例是基于此案与彼案的识别。 A 是 A。如果没有两颗豌豆是完全相同的，那么法律案件我们该怎么说呢？先例还使法官能够将他们现在做出的个人决定的责任放在过去的肩上。
The law, says Thurman Arnold, may be dressed up by students of jurisprudence to look like a science, but any attempt to define “the law” with precision “leads us into a maze of metaphysical literature, perhaps larger than has ever surrounded any other symbol in the history of the world.” In the law, the poor are comforted by the fact that rich and poor are equal before it. The fortunate are reassured that careful people are treated better than careless people, who are punished for their mistakes. The trader is cheered by learning that the more profitable forms of sharp dealing are ignored by the law under the principle of individual freedom. The preacher is glad to know that all forms of dishonesty which can be curbed without interfering with economic law are curbed. Radicals are comforted by the news that the law is elastic; conservatives by the news that it grows ever more certain. The wage-earner is told that not even his employer is above the law; the employer feels secure in the knowledge that the due-process clause of the Constitution puts his property beyond the greedy reach of legislative enactment. The law saves us at once from the mob and from the dictator. It gives to all an equal chance for success. A government of laws and not of men!
瑟曼·阿诺德说，法律可能被法理学学生打扮得像一门科学，但任何精确定义“法律”的尝试“都会把我们带入形而上学文献的迷宫，也许比任何其他文献都要大”。世界历史上的象征。”在法律中，穷人因富人和穷人在法律面前平等而感到安慰。幸运者会放心，谨慎的人比粗心的人受到更好的对待，粗心的人会因为错误而受到惩罚。交易者得知根据个人自由原则，法律忽视了更有利可图的犀利交易形式，这让交易者感到高兴。传教士很高兴知道，在不干扰经济规律的情况下可以遏制的所有形式的不诚实行为都得到了遏制。法律富有弹性的消息让激进分子感到安慰。保守派人士听到这一消息变得更加确定。工薪阶层被告知，即使是他的雇主也不能凌驾于法律之上；雇主感到安全，因为他知道宪法的正当程序条款将他的财产置于立法的贪婪范围之外。法律立即将我们从暴徒和独裁者手中拯救出来。它为所有人提供平等的成功机会。法治政府而不是人治政府！
How beautiful, and what balderdash! There is not a reliable referent in the litany. Should we then tear the idea out of our minds as false and mischievous? Arnold says no, for men need comforting fictions in a drab world. When the Russians undertook to strip law of its mysticism after the Revolution, the hobgoblins which were thrown out of the front door ran around to the back door, with different names. Men seem to need an “ideal state” as they often seem to need a God. If they need God, that is their business, but the myth of an “ideal state” may ruin the business of the community, when practical affairs of survival are too long neglected in burning incense before the law. Incense may seem a far-fetched figure. Here are quotations from two letters to the newspapers in 1937 following President Roosevelt’s proposal to add younger blood to the Supreme Court:
多么美丽，多么胡言乱语！冗长的叙述中没有可靠的指称。那么我们是否应该将这个想法视为虚假和恶作剧而从我们的脑海中抹去呢？阿诺德说不，因为男人在单调的世界中需要安慰的小说。当俄国人在大革命后着手废除法律的神秘主义时，被从前门扔出的大妖怪们以不同的名字绕到后门。人们似乎需要一个“理想状态”，就像他们常常需要一个上帝一样。如果他们需要上帝，那是他们的事，但“理想国家”的神话可能会毁了社区的事，因为在法律面前烧香太久而忽视了生存的实际事务。香似乎是一个牵强的数字。以下是 1937 年罗斯福总统提议为最高法院注入年轻血液后写给报纸的两封信的引述：
May the dear Lord bless our Supreme Court as it is, and save us and our children from the terrible fate thrust upon a nation by Rehoboam and his inexperienced advisers.
愿亲爱的主保佑我们的最高法院，并将我们和我们的孩子从罗波安和他缺乏经验的顾问强加给国家的可怕命运中拯救出来。
God will carry us through this catastrophe.
神会带领我们渡过这场灾难。
“Lawabiding citizens” are notoriously good people; “the lawless element” is notoriously bad. But the violation of some laws is a normal part of the behavior of every citizen. During the unhappy period of alcoholic Prohibition, most of us were “lawless elements.” “Lawlessness,” then, according to Frank, reduces to a charge of a mistaken selection of the existing laws which are to be ignored. Once the relativity of the term is grasped, it fades away as an absolute evil.
“守法公民”是出了名的好人； “不法分子”是出了名的坏。但违反一些法律是每个公民行为的正常组成部分。在禁酒令的不幸时期，我们大多数人都是“不法分子”。弗兰克认为，“无法无天”可以归结为对错误选择应被忽视的现有法律的指控。一旦掌握了这个词的相对性，它就会作为一种绝对的邪恶而消失。
Little help and much hindrance in dealing with problems of social control is rendered by the use of the word “lawlessness.” At its best it connotes an absence of law. But the symbol “law” itself is fatally ambiguous; by usage it may properly be employed to symbolize a dozen different subject matters; there is a growing inclination to abandon it as a useful label. Lawlessness as a symbol is still more vague and confusing. It should be excluded as far as possible from the vocabulary of careful students. When encountered it should be subjected to wise skepticism, washed in what Mr. Justice Holmes called “cynical acid.”
“无法无天”这个词的使用对解决社会控制问题几乎没有帮助，反而造成很大阻碍。最好的情况是，它意味着法律的缺失。但“法律”这个符号本身却是极其模糊的。根据用途，它可以适当地用来象征十几种不同的主题；人们越来越倾向于放弃它这个有用的标签。无法无天作为一种象征仍然更加模糊和混乱。应尽可能将其从细心的学生的词汇中排除。当遇到这种情况时，应该受到明智的怀疑，并用霍姆斯法官先生所说的“愤世嫉俗的酸”来清洗。
But what editors will do without their “lawless elements” whenever a strike is called, I do not know. Perhaps editors are not careful students. “Lawlessness” is a kind of swear word used to wallop somebody you disapprove of. Mr. Frank is a seminarist after my own heart. As an economist, I am in favor of giving up the term “capitalism” as hopelessly ambiguous. As a lawyer, he is in favor of giving up not only “lawlessness” but “law.” Such a step would certainly help us to see real judges behaving in a real world. We would no longer write letters to the newspapers asking God to protect the Supreme Court.
但一旦罢工，如果没有“不法分子”，编辑们会做什么，我就不知道了。也许编辑们都是不细心的学生。 “无法无天”是一种脏话，用来攻击你不赞成的人。弗兰克先生是一位合我心意的神学院学生。作为一名经济学家，我赞成放弃“资本主义”一词，因为它含糊不清。作为一名律师，他主张放弃的不仅仅是“无法无天”，还有“法律”。这样的一步肯定会帮助我们看到真正的法官在现实世界中的行为。我们不会再给报纸写信请求上帝保护最高法院。
Other weasel words in the jargon of lawyers are:
律师行话中的其他狡猾的词是：
manifest intention freedom of contract due care
明显意图合同自由应有注意
prudent good faith due process
审慎诚信正当程序
negligence ought to know reasonable
疏忽应知合理
Such terms are used as if they had precise meaning, thereby creating an appearance of continuity and uniformity which does not in fact exist. A special legal style, says Wurzel,1 has been developed, with such phrases as “we must assume as proved,” “it appears to be without foundation,” “we cannot justly doubt.” It is the purpose of such phrases to make the difference between the probable facts of a case and the inference drawn from them as inconspicuous as possible.
这些术语的使用就好像它们具有精确的含义一样，从而产生了实际上并不存在的连续性和统一性的外观。武泽尔说，一种特殊的法律风格已经形成，其中包括“我们必须假设已被证明”、“它似乎没有根据”、“我们不能公正地怀疑”等短语。这些短语的目的是使案件的可能事实与从中得出的推论之间的差异尽可能不明显。
It is to the courts that conservative men turn when new ideas in social affairs cause them mental anguish. Then, why don’t they say plainly that judges are better policy-makers than elected legislatures or executives? One could have no quarrel with the clarity of such a statement. But they do not say so; they begin to talk about laying heretical hands on our imperishable Constitution, about the violation of sacred principles and the dictatorial annulment of sacred rights. In short, they pass right over the human judges on the bench to the Law in the clouds. Lawyers take up the hue and cry. The United States Senate, composed largely of lawyers, presents such a spectacle of bad language as the world has seldom seen, for months on end. Common folks are perplexed and torn between the realities of what they desperately need in the present and the trailing glories of the past.
当社会事务中的新观念给保守派人士带来精神痛苦时，他们就会向法院求助。那么，他们为什么不直白地说，法官是比民选立法机构或行政人员更好的政策制定者呢？人们对这样一种表述的清晰性没有异议。但他们不这么说；他们开始谈论对我们不朽的宪法施加异端影响，谈论违反神圣原则和独裁废除神圣权利。简而言之，它们超越了法官席上的人类法官，而是云端的法律。律师们纷纷大声喊叫。主要由律师组成的美国参议院连续数月呈现出世界罕见的脏话景象。普通人在当前迫切需要的现实和过去的辉煌之间感到困惑和撕裂。
The serious thing for you and me and Adam1 is that behind this turmoil of emotion, certain well-to-do gentlemen in great utility corporations and elsewhere march straight to what they want. The whole exhibit is pie for them. The Constitution, like patriotism, can become the last refuge of scoundrels. The courts, says E. S. Robinson, are still burdened with the theory that they are laundries of the soul. We may respect judges who refuse to give up dreaming, but let us not turn aside from tangible social goals because of the fear that such a course may disturb a set of imaginary values. Especially let us not turn aside when unscrupulous men are waiting to capitalize the detour.
对你、我和亚当来说，严肃的事情是，在这种情绪动荡的背后，大型公用事业公司和其他地方的某些富有的绅士径直走向他们想要的东西。整个展览对他们来说就是馅饼。宪法和爱国主义一样，可能成为流氓最后的避难所。 ES Robinson 说，法院仍然背负着“灵魂洗衣房”这一理论的重担。我们可以尊重那些拒绝放弃梦想的法官，但我们也不要因为担心这样的做法会扰乱一系列想象的价值观而放弃切实的社会目标。尤其是当无良之人伺机绕道而行时，我们不要掉以轻心。
Semantically considered, “the law” is a parade of abstractions, normally without referents. As in the case of classical economic theory, it can be used and is used to make citizens more uncomfortable than they need be. Legal machinery for settling disputes and enacting statutes, on the other hand, is vitally necessary in civilized communities. Those judges, juries, arbitrators, who make the decisions are human beings, limited by their own experience, by the Thingumbobs they have met and the “principles” they have digested. If they are very old and full of principles derived from an earlier cultural era, the decisions they hand down may be inapplicable to the current situation, and sometimes really disastrous. Certain authorities believe that the decision of Mr. Justice Taney in the Dred Scott case was a major reason for the Civil War. Many decisions of the Supreme Court in the past two generations have checked and bedeviled the doing of things which ultimately had to be done. The income-tax law, the minimum wage law, were thrown out because judges personally did not like these ideas, but responsibility was shifted to the due-process clause of the Constitution. Later it was found that due process was not violated, and both pieces of legislation were admitted. By concentrating on the sublimities of due process, we lose sight of the judges. I suggest that we keep looking steadily at the man on the bench, a metaphorical pop bottle in either hand. If he is unable to surmount his stock of 1880 Thingumbobs, we had best begin looking about for an arbitrator who can do so.
从语义上考虑，“法律”是一系列抽象概念，通常没有指称。与古典经济理论一样，它可以被使用并且被用来让公民比他们需要的更加不舒服。另一方面，解决争端和制定法规的法律机制对于文明社会至关重要。那些做出决定的法官、陪审团、仲裁员都是人，他们受到自己的经验、他们所遇到的Thingumbobs和他们所消化的“原则”的限制。如果他们非常古老并且充满了来自早期文化时代的原则，那么他们做出的决定可能不适用于当前情况，有时甚至是灾难性的。某些权威人士认为，塔尼法官在德雷德·斯科特案中的判决是导致内战的一个主要原因。过去两代最高法院的许多判决都对最终必须做的事情进行了检查和困扰。所得税法、最低工资法被废弃，因为法官个人不喜欢这些想法，但责任转移到了宪法的正当程序条款上。后来发现并没有违反正当程序，两项立法均被接受。由于专注于正当程序的崇高性，我们忽视了法官。我建议我们继续盯着长凳上的那个人，他的两只手都拿着一个隐喻的汽水瓶。如果他无法超越 1880 个 Thingumbobs 的库存，我们最好开始寻找能够做到这一点的仲裁员。
This has been a difficult chapter to write. No sooner does one contemplate the law and literature of the law than he plunges headfirst into a viscous sea of verbiage which all but drowns him. I have tried to make clear two things. First, that talk about the American Constitution today as if it meant to us what it meant to the founding Fathers is often nonsense, because of the change in context of situation. Second, that there is no certainty, no surety, no omniscience in the law except in ghostly realms. Craving omniscience, we can very gravely injure our relations to the world outside by prostrating ourselves before a phantom. Under the cover of that genuflection, unscrupulous men can make off with the family silver.
这是很难写的一章。一个人一旦思考法律和法律文献，就会一头扎进一片粘稠的废话海洋，几乎将他淹没。我试图澄清两件事。首先，今天谈论美国宪法就好像它对我们意味着它对开国元勋的意义一样，这往往是无稽之谈，因为情况发生了变化。其次，除了幽灵领域之外，法律中没有确定性、保证性和全知性。由于渴望无所不知，我们可能会因屈服于幻影而严重损害我们与外部世界的关系。在那跪拜的掩护下，无良之人可以盗取家中的银子。
Semantic reform would be aided by judges who can wisely decide situations in a real world, now, using whatever practical rules may be necessary. It would be aided by a type of judge who can look more outside and less inside. There are a lot of us needing all the help such & judge can give us, out here beyond his mind.
语义改革将得到法官的帮助，他们现在可以使用任何可能需要的实际规则来明智地决定现实世界中的情况。能够更多地关注外部、更少关注内部的法官将会对此有所帮助。我们很多人都需要法官能够给予我们的所有帮助，而这超出了他的想象。

STROLL WITH THE STATESMEN
与政治家一起漫步
DURING the World War a patriotic American physician protested against the placards GERMAN MEASLES displayed on houses where children were ill. He suggested VICTORY MEASLES or LIBERTY MEASLES.
世界大战期间，一位爱国的美国医生抗议在儿童患病的房屋上张贴“德国麻疹”标语牌。他建议使用“胜利麻疹”或“自由麻疹”。
H. G. Wells says:
HG 威尔斯 说：
Many publicists think of international relations in terms of Powers, mysterious entities of a value entirely romantic and diplomatic. International politics is for them only thinkable as a competition of these Powers. Patriotism is not something Power represents, but something in which Power trades. Germany, Austria, Britain, France are not names of peoples or regions, but of Powers personified. They say: Austria will not like this; France will insist upon that. . . . To this Power idea, political life of the last two centuries has schooled many otherwise intelligent men and by it their minds are now invincibly circumscribed and fixed.
许多公关人员从权力的角度来看待国际关系，这些神秘的实体具有完全浪漫和外交的价值。对他们来说，国际政治只能被视为这些大国之间的竞争。爱国主义不是权力所代表的东西，而是权力所交易的东西。德国、奥地利、英国、法国不是民族或地区的名称，而是强国的化身。他们说：奥地利不会喜欢这样；法国将坚持这一点。 。 。 。对于这种权力观念，过去两个世纪的政治生活已经教育了许多原本聪明的人，他们的思想现在受到了不可战胜的限制和固定。
It is almost as difficult to visualize a “Power” or a “nation” as it is to visualize “the good.” I ask you think of “Germany,” and what do you see? An area colored yellow or green (the British Empire was usually red) on a map in your school geography. That is your chief visible referent. Germany has geographical reality, although its boundaries make little topographical sense, and are sometimes shifted. The other measurable referent is the native population living in this area, men, women and children. They can be counted. Their characteristics, however, are astronomical in complexity and variation. Some of these people compose the German Government, and one person makes the major political decisions.
想象一个“权力”或一个“国家”几乎和想象“善”一样困难。我问你想到“德国”，你看到了什么？学校地理地图上的黄色或绿色区域（大英帝国通常为红色）。那是你的主要可见参照物。德国有地理现实，尽管它的边界在地形上没有什么意义，而且有时会发生变化。另一个可衡量的参考对象是居住在该地区的本地人口，包括男性、女性和儿童。它们是可以计算的。然而，它们的特征在复杂性和变化方面是天文数字。其中一些人组成了德国政府，重大政治决策由一人做出。
A topographical section, a file of people, or a group of officials is not, however, the personified “nation” commonly used in language. The latter is something impressively more, an essence, a might, a will—and so a goblin. Observations in the area disclose nothing corresponding to such an essence. They disclose Schmidt1, Schmidt2, Schmidt3 going about their business if they have any, or kicking their heels in an employment office if they have none. “Germany” may have gone mad in 1914 and again in 1933, as excited commentators say, but the organic madness is in the realms of demonology, not in the area called Germany. You yourself recognize this when you say, “The German people are decent, kindly folk in the main, but Germany. . .”
然而，一段地形、一群人或一群官员并不是语言中常用的拟人化“民族”。后者的意义更令人印象深刻，是一种本质、一种力量、一种意志——所以是妖精。该地区的观察没有揭示出与这种本质相对应的信息。如果他们有的话，他们会透露 Schmidt1、Schmidt2、Schmidt3 正在做自己的生意；如果他们没有的话，他们就会在就业办公室里闲逛。正如兴奋的评论家所说，“德国”可能在 1914 年和 1933 年再次陷入疯狂，但这种有机的疯狂是在恶魔学领域，而不是在所谓的德国地区。当你说“德国人民大体上是正派、友善的人，但德国人”时，你自己就认识到了这一点。 。 ”。
If Germany in terms of real referents does thus and so, then you must be prepared to see every person in the population, with a heave-ho like sailors on a rope, doing thus and so. “Germany chokes freedom.” All together, now, choke! But if all together, who is left to be choked? The cows, perhaps, or an American newspaperman in Berlin. Well, some persons called Germans are choking the activities of other Germans. Correct. The German Government as a group of officials is doing some choking. Yes. But “Germany” is not doing any choking. No. When you get away from “Germany” and begin to think about Schmidt1, the fog begins to lift. In any country in so-called Western civilization you will find most people eating, sleeping, laughing, talking, going to market; rearing children, working in factories, tilling the soil, reading newspapers, attending concerts, games, and moving pictures, riding in railroad trains and motorcars, a good deal as most people are doing in the next country.
如果德国在真正的参照物方面这样做如此如此，那么你必须准备好看到人口中的每个人，像绳子上的水手一样，这样做如此如此。 “德国扼杀自由。”大家齐心协力，现在，窒息！但如果全部加在一起，还有谁会被噎住呢？也许是奶牛，或者是柏林的一位美国新闻记者。好吧，一些被称为德国人的人正在扼杀其他德国人的活动。正确的。德国政府作为一群官员正在做一些令人窒息的事情。是的。但“德国”并没有做出任何令人窒息的事情。不。当你离开“德国”并开始思考施密特1时，迷雾就开始消散。在任何所谓西方文明的国家，你都会发现大多数人吃饭、睡觉、笑、说话、去市场；抚养孩子，在工厂工作，耕地，看报纸，参加音乐会、游戏和电影，乘坐火车和汽车，这些都是大多数人在邻国所做的事情。
Some people in Germany today are performing certain acts of which I disapprove. But I find many people in the area called America performing acts of which I also disapprove. Mr. Hearst, for instance. Are there relatively more of such actions in Germany? I believe there are, but I confess my inventory is not complete. At this point intelligent criticism can take place, but not in the foggy realms of a “mad Germany.”
今天德国有些人正在做出我不赞成的某些行为。但我发现在美国这个地区，很多人的行为也是我所不赞成的。以赫斯特先生为例。德国这样的行动相对较多吗？我相信有，但我承认我的清单并不完整。此时可以进行明智的批评，但不能在“疯狂的德国”的迷雾领域进行。
The Middle Ages suffered from the bad language of theology, but not from abstract “nations” and “Powers.” These monsters are hardly more than two centuries old. If a nation is not a person, it obviously has no personal sense of honor. Therefore its “honor” cannot be insulted. If Chancellor Blowhard gives orders to shoot down the citizens of a village across the border in the country of Zenda, the government of Zenda has reason to take strong measures, for its people have been cruelly hurt. But if Chancellor Blowhard announces that Zenda has been chosen by God as a refuge for all the knaves and poltroons on earth, the only official notice warranted by the government of Zenda is to ask the people across the border why they elected such a silly Chancellor. To order general mobilization because of an insult to a ghost is madness indeed. But military reprisals have been undertaken for less. More normally, a battle of insults precedes the gunpowder.
中世纪饱受神学脏话之苦，但并非抽象的“国家”和“强权”。这些怪物的历史还不到两个世纪。一个民族如果不是一个人，显然就没有个人的荣誉感。因此，它的“荣誉”是不容侮辱的。如果布洛哈德议长下令射杀赞达国边境另一边村庄的居民，赞达政府有理由采取强硬措施，因为赞达人民受到了残酷的伤害。但是，如果布洛哈德议长宣布赞达已被上帝选为地球上所有无赖和恶棍的避难所，那么赞达政府唯一授权的官方通知就是询问边境另一边的人民为什么他们选举了如此愚蠢的议长。因为侮辱鬼魂而下令总动员，这确实是疯狂的行为。但军事报复的代价却较低。更正常的情况是，在火药爆发之前会发生一场辱骂之战。
I say the “government” of Zenda and fall into my own trap. What is “my government” that diplomats are so punctilious about? “My government requests an immediate apology.” . . . “My government extends the warmest hopes for His Majesty’s recovery from the stone . . . Where are realities for these envelopes sealed with the great seal, these satin breeches, these grim lips and frozen politenesses? It is said that not more than eight persons can sit around a table together to discuss a given topic and make intelligent progress. When a pressing decision must be reached, seven are better than eight, five are better than seven, one is best of all. Somewhere around that table, you will probably find your “government.” When thinking about “governments,” let your mind go through the word to a great mahogany table. Who is sitting there? How wise are they, or is he? What would you do if your legs were under it?
我说的是Zenda的“政府”，结果落入了我自己的陷阱。外交官如此拘谨的“我的政府”是什么？ “我国政府要求立即道歉。” 。 。 。 “我国政府对国王陛下从石头中康复表示最热烈的希望。 。 。这些用大印章密封的信封、这些缎子马裤、这些冷酷的嘴唇和冰冷的礼貌在哪里？据说，最多八个人可以围坐在一张桌子旁讨论某个话题并取得明智的进展。当必须做出紧急决定时，七个比八个好，五个比七个好，一个是最好的。在那张桌子周围的某个地方，你可能会找到你的“政府”。当想到“政府”时，让你的大脑将这个词想象到一张巨大的红木桌子上。谁坐在那里？他们有多聪明，或者他有多聪明？如果你的腿在它下面你会做什么？
At no point is the semantic discipline more needed than in agreements between nations. Treaties are signed and torn up; solemn obligations are entered into and repudiated; generous understandings are reached and violated. Part of this is due to bad faith. The diplomatic gentlemen are sometimes plain liars. But part of it occurs because the high contracting parties have not located the referents which their high words discuss. Why not tear up a treaty where party A believes that clause 11 refers to munitions-in-general, and party B believes it refers to explosives and rifles? When you read aa editorial complaining that solemn international obligations have been violated, it is a wise idea to find out if the obligation is the kind of Thingumbob which really can be violated. High talk by high fools does more damage in international affairs, one suspects, than sinister plots and barefaced lies by diplomatic knaves.
在任何时候，语义规则都比国家之间的协议更需要。条约被签署又被撕毁；签订和否认庄严的义务；达成或违反慷慨的谅解。部分原因是由于恶意。外交绅士有时是彻头彻尾的骗子。但部分原因是缔约方没有找到其高调讨论的对象。如果甲方认为第 11 条涉及一般弹药，而乙方认为其涉及爆炸物和步枪，为什么不撕毁条约呢？当你读到一篇社论抱怨庄严的国际义务遭到违反时，明智的做法是查明该义务是否是真正可以违反的那种义务。有人怀疑，大傻瓜的高调言论对国际事务造成的损害比外交流氓的险恶阴谋和赤裸裸的谎言更大。
From the American papers in July, 1937, comes an Associated Press story:
1937 年 7 月的美国报纸上刊登了美联社的一篇报道：
Soviet Russia received an apology from Secretary of State Hull today because Admiral William D. Leahy, United States Chief of Naval Operations, recently called the Russian people “virtual slaves.” Leahy’s remarks, made in a recent speech, prompted Russian diplomats to file objections. The admiral explained he meant no offense.
苏俄今天收到了赫尔国务卿的道歉，因为美国海军作战部长威廉·D·莱希海军上将最近称俄罗斯人民为“虚拟奴隶”。莱希在最近的一次演讲中发表的言论引发了俄罗斯外交官的反对。海军上将解释说，他无意冒犯。
Whatever he meant, the phrase has no communicable value. The Russians, said the admiral, are blab blabs. Yet the “insult” is taken seriously, the cables warm up, notes are exchanged, diplomats go hastily down long corridors with official papers, an international incident is in the offing. Which reminds me that Joseph Cotton when Assistant Secretary of State found to his dismay that there was no word in the American diplomatic code for “laugh.”
不管他的意思是什么，这句话没有任何传播价值。海军上将说，俄罗斯人是胡言乱语。然而，这种“侮辱”被认真对待，电报升温，交换纸条，外交官带着官方文件匆匆走过长长的走廊，一场国际事件即将发生。这让我想起助理国务卿约瑟夫·科顿（Joseph Cotton）沮丧地发现美国外交法典中没有“笑”这个词。
Kingsley Martin tells us that in 1929 Lord Snowden created an international crisis by using the word “grotesque” in connection with a French Minister’s proposal for a financial settlement. We had better go back to the duel in cases of this kind. Let Lord Snowden give the French Minister satisfaction for injured honor at thirty paces, rather than run the risk of calling out the army and navy because La Patrie cannot tolerate the word “grotesque.”
金斯利·马丁告诉我们，1929 年，斯诺登勋爵在法国部长提出的财务解决方案中使用了“怪诞”一词，制造了一场国际危机。遇到这种情况我们最好还是回去决斗吧。让斯诺登勋爵在三十步之外让法国部长对荣誉受损表示满意，而不是冒着出动陆军和海军的风险，因为拉帕特里不能容忍“怪诞”这个词。
Mr. Martin was mentioned in an earlier chapter as an expert dissector of the British “Crown.” Observe in the following quotation how Disraeli, Prime Minister at the time, and so the man at the mahogany table, skillfully shifted responsibility to a magical Crown, and thus checkmated effective opposition to his policies.
马丁先生在前面的章节中被提到是英国“王冠”的专家剖析者。请观察下面的引文，看看当时的首相迪斯雷利以及桃花心木桌上的那个人如何巧妙地将责任转移给一个神奇的王冠，从而挫败了对其政策的有效反对。
What Disraeli did in his Crystal Palace speech was to blend into one vast imperial whole the problem of the white dominions, the problem of Ireland, the problem of the Near East, the problem of India, and finally, by a stroke of genius, the problem of Queen Victoria’s relationship to her subjects. Henceforward it was impossible to induce anyone to think clearly and coolly about any of these issues. It became impossible to hint at the necessity of Home Rule in Ireland, or to demand better government in India or to discuss the ethics of British occupation of Egypt, without being charged with disloyalty to the Queen. To turn an intelligent imperialist movement into a popular jingoism, which bore fruit in the Boer War, was the immediate result of Disraeli’s exploitation of the Crown.
迪斯雷利在水晶宫演讲中所做的就是将白人领土问题、爱尔兰问题、近东问题、印度问题融入到一个巨大的帝国整体中，最后，凭借天才的一击，维多利亚女王与其臣民的关系问题。从此以后，不可能让任何人清楚、冷静地思考这些问题。如果不被指控对女王不忠，就不可能暗示爱尔兰地方自治的必要性，或者要求印度更好的政府，或者讨论英国占领埃及的道德规范。将明智的帝国主义运动转变为流行的沙文主义，并在布尔战争中取得成果，是迪斯雷利剥削王室的直接结果。
The long agony of the people labeled “Jews” is largely caused by semantic confusion. The abstraction “Jew” is given an equipment of phantom characteristics. Isaac1, Isaac2, and Isaac3 are then harassed or tortured on the basis of this notion, precisely as the “lazy” boy was misjudged and harried by his parents. If you meet a person subscribing to a certain religion called “Jewish” and do not like him, that is one thing. It may be his weakness or it may be yours. But if you denounce him as a “Jew,” apart from his space-time characteristics, you perform a monstrous act. You are a victim of genuine hallucinations and, strictly speaking, are not sane, for there is no concrete entity “Jew” in the living world. For such behavior I am willing to call Hitler mad. There are also many madmen of this persuasion in New York City.
被贴上“犹太人”标签的人们的长期痛苦很大程度上是由语义混乱造成的。 “犹太人”这个抽象概念被赋予了一种幽灵般的特征。 Isaac1、Isaac2和Isaac3随后基于这种观念而受到骚扰或折磨，正如“懒惰”男孩被父母误判和骚扰一样。如果你遇到一个信奉某种称为“犹太人”的宗教的人并且不喜欢他，那是一回事。这可能是他的弱点，也可能是你的弱点。但如果你谴责他是“犹太人”，抛开他的时空特征，你就做出了一种可怕的行为。你是真正幻觉的受害者，严格来说，你是不理智的，因为在现实世界中不存在具体的实体“犹太人”。对于这种行为我愿意称希特勒为疯子。纽约市也有很多持这种观点的疯子。
“The American people will never tolerate socialism; will never tolerate fascism; will never surrender their liberties; will never defy their Constitution.” How often have the changes been rung on these stirring statements? One might as well say, “The people of the moon will never tolerate green cheese.” Produce referents for “American people,” “socialism,” “fascism,” “liberty,” “defy their Constitution.” Otherwise such statements can elicit emotion, but little more.
“美国人民永远不会容忍社会主义；永远不会容忍法西斯主义；永远不会放弃自己的自由；永远不会违抗他们的宪法。”这些激动人心的声明多久发生一次变化？人们不妨说：“月球上的人们永远不会容忍绿色奶酪。”为“美国人民”、“社会主义”、“法西斯主义”、“自由”、“违抗宪法”提供参考。否则，此类言论可能会引发情绪，但仅此而已。
Writing on the future of democracy in the New Republic, Luis Alberto Sanchez of Peru begins his contribution to a symposium: “Political democracy is not on the wane; it is going through a period of correction and of clarification.” While Sanin Cano of Colombia begins his: “I am afraid democracy is practically losing ground all over the world.”
秘鲁的路易斯·阿尔贝托·桑切斯 (Luis Alberto Sanchez) 在一次研讨会上谈到了新共和国民主的未来：“政治民主并未衰落；而是在衰落。”它正在经历一段修正和澄清的时期。”哥伦比亚的萨宁·卡诺 (Sanin Cano) 开始说道：“恐怕民主实际上正在全世界失去立足点。”
Is this a flat disagreement on the facts? No. It is disagreement because each gentleman means a different thing by “democracy.” If we are to talk sensibly about democracy we should begin by asking, What kind of democracy? Where? When? Shall the kind be political as in a nation, industrial as in a labor union, or social as in a club? Shall the place and time be Athens, 500 B.C., the Roman Republic of 100 B.C., the Dutch Republic of 1600, the Commonwealth of Cromwell in 1655, the American democracy of 1787, or the American democracy of 1938? “Democracy-in-general” is as treacherous a term as “production-in-general.”
这是对事实的直接分歧吗？不。这是分歧，因为每位绅士对“民主”的含义都不同。如果我们要明智地谈论民主，我们应该首先问：什么样的民主？在哪里？什么时候？这种类型应该是国家中的政治性、工会中的工业性还是俱乐部中的社会性？地点和时间是公元前500年的雅典、公元前100年的罗马共和国、1600年的荷兰共和国、1655年的克伦威尔联邦、1787年的美国民主还是1938年的美国民主？ “总体民主”与“总体生产”一样都是危险的术语。
In the world of today, let us see if we can find the significant relations between various governmental forms now in operation. I think it fair to assume that the major decisions of all governments are made by very few men, often by one man. Mr. Baldwin was long the chief decision-maker for the British Empire—he dismissed the late King; Mr. Roosevelt has made decisions recently for the United States, Mr. Blum for the French Government, Hitler for the German Government, Mussolini for the Italian, Stalin for the Russian. These gentlemen are subject to various checks and balances, but for the moment their decisions are conclusive. The check on Stalin is expulsion by the Central Committee of the Communist party; the check on Hitler is the Reichswehr; on Baldwin, the Parliament and the Cabinet; on Roosevelt, the Congress and the Supreme Court. The check on Mussolini appears to be only his own conscience.
在当今世界，让我们看看是否能找到目前运作的各种政府形式之间的重要关系。我认为，可以公平地假设，所有政府的重大决策都是由极少数人（通常是一个人）做出的。鲍德温先生长期以来一直是大英帝国的主要决策者——他解雇了已故国王；罗斯福先生最近为美国做出了决定，布鲁姆先生为法国政府做出了决定，希特勒为德国政府做出了决定，墨索里尼为意大利政府做出了决定，斯大林为俄罗斯政府做出了决定。这些先生们受到各种制衡，但目前他们的决定是决定性的。对斯大林的制衡是被共产党中央开除党籍；对希特勒的制衡是德国国防军；关于鲍德温、议会和内阁；关于罗斯福、国会和最高法院。对墨索里尼的制衡似乎只是他自己的良心。
In the so-called democratic governments, the man who decides is elected by a counting of citizens’ votes, and while his decisions may be mandatory when he is in office, if the majority of citizens do not like them, they can vote him out at the next election, appoint another leader, and reverse the policies. In the so-called dictatorships, the man who makes the decisions has no time limit. He stays indefinitely. He can be ousted only by violence. The fear of violence leads him to apply more castor oil, concentration camps, firing squads, and secret-service corps than democratic leaders do. His political decisions may be better or worse, but the methods he usually adopts to keep himself in office are worse. On the other hand, he can often get things done with more efficiency than can democratic statesmen. Dictators can begin a war more readily, and in the past have used war as a method of keeping themselves in office.
在所谓的民主政府中，做决定的人是通过计算公民选票选出的，虽然他的决定在他任职期间可能是强制性的，但如果大多数公民不喜欢这些决定，他们可以投票让他下台在下一次选举中，任命另一位领导人并扭转政策。在所谓的独裁统治中，做出决定的人没有时间限制。他无限期地留下来。他只能通过暴力被驱逐。对暴力的恐惧导致他比民主领导人使用更多的蓖麻油、集中营、行刑队和特勤部队。他的政治决策可能更好也可能更坏，但他通常采取的保住职位的方法却更糟糕。另一方面，他往往能比民主政治家更有效率地完成任务。独裁者更容易发动战争，过去也曾利用战争作为保住自己权力的手段。
Dictators can get things done. It is folly to blink this fact. The rate of change, especially technological change—it can be roughly measured in kilowatts of energy consumed per year—makes it imperative to get things done. Democratic governments, with their checks and balances and repeated shifts in policy-makers, often avoid rather than squarely face the problems raised by change. Speaking of England, Hogben says:
独裁者可以把事情做好。对这个事实视而不见是愚蠢的。变革的速度，尤其是技术变革的速度（可以粗略地以每年消耗的能源千瓦数来衡量）使得完成工作势在必行。民主政府由于政策制定者的制衡和反复转变，往往会回避而不是正视变革带来的问题。谈到英格兰，霍格本说道：
The machinery of educational selection operates to recruit the nation’s statesmen from those who can talk glibly, write elegantly, and argue forcibly, without the capacity to act competently. When the need for action is urgent, they can only continue to talk glibly, write elegantly, and argue forcibly. If democracy can produce only leaders who can talk it is doomed. . . .
教育选拔机制的作用是从那些能言善辩、文笔优美、辩论有力、但没有能力胜任行动的人中招募国家政治家。当需要采取行动的紧迫性时，他们只能继续油嘴滑舌、文笔优美、力辩不休。如果民主只能产生会说话的领导人，那它就注定失败。 。 。 。
Most of us in America as well as in England prefer a democratic form of government. But when we are confronted with the weaknesses of democracy as currently practiced, we tend to burst into rhetoric about freedom, liberty, the Constitution, hallowed rights and imperishable traditions. Such talk does not get things done. On the contrary, it delays them. Intelligent citizens who value democracy should forget the rhetoric and bend their energies toward making studies, performing experiments, to the end of changing the machinery of democracy to articulate with changes in the environment. Such a course is impossible if people think of democracy as an entity, fixed, eternal, and inviolate. Sweden is now providing a laboratory where new machinery is being invented to keep the democratic method up to date. That, I submit, is the way to avoid dictators.
美国和英国的大多数人都更喜欢民主的政府形式。但当我们面对目前实行的民主的弱点时，我们往往会爆发出关于自由、自由、宪法、神圣权利和不朽传统的言论。这样的谈话并不能解决问题。相反，这会耽误他们。重视民主的聪明公民应该忘记花言巧语，把精力集中在研究、实验上，最终改变民主机制，以适应环境的变化。如果人们认为民主是一个固定的、永恒的、不可侵犯的实体，那么这种做法是不可能的。瑞典现在提供了一个实验室，在那里发明新的机器，以保持民主方法与时俱进。我认为，这是避免独裁者的方法。
The majority of citizens go about their business in one country as in the next. This is the objective picture to keep constantly in mind. As I went about Russia in 1927, I had to pinch myself to realize that these peaceful, friendly, busy people were in the midst of a great historical revolution. On top of the common base of daily behavior rises the governmental structure, normally with one man making the chief decisions in any given country at any one time. It is in some such focus that you and I and Adam1 should form our opinions on national policy. It is this picture we should see before we demand a war for democracy, or military aid for warring factions in foreign countries in the interest of preserving democracy.
大多数公民在一个国家或在另一个国家开展业务。这是要时刻牢记的客观情况。 1927年，当我走遍俄罗斯时，我不得不掐自己一下，才意识到这些和平、友好、忙碌的人民正处于一场伟大的历史革命之中。在日常行为的共同基础之上，出现了政府结构，通常在任何特定国家，任何时间都有一个人做出主要决策。正是在这样的关注点上，你、我和 Adam1 应该形成我们对国家政策的看法。在我们要求为民主而战，或为了维护民主而向外国交战派别提供军事援助之前，我们应该看到这样的画面。
One-man governments today have three names—“communism,” “fascism,” and “republics” where the President holds power until the next coup d’etat, as in certain South American countries. What are the observable distinctions? The man at the top follows the accredited pattern of hanging on to his job. He is used to it, he likes the quarters, and he hates to quit. Modern dictatorships are heavily collectivized in the sense that the state dominates and directs economic activities. Private businesses may or may not be profitable, but so far as power is concerned, they are subservient to the dictator.
今天的单人政府有三个名称——“共产主义”、“法西斯主义”和“共和国”，总统掌权直到下一次政变，就像在某些南美国家一样。有哪些可观察到的区别？高层人士遵循公认的保住工作的模式。他已经习惯了，他喜欢这里，而且他讨厌放弃。从国家主导和指导经济活动的意义上来说，现代独裁政权是高度集体化的。私营企业可能会盈利，也可能不会盈利，但就权力而言，它们是屈服于独裁者的。
In the so-called communistic dictatorship of Russia, the plain man is probably more highly regarded today than in the so-called fascist dictatorships of Germany and Italy. Ivan1 may even receive a greater relative quota of consumers’ goods and public benefits, but no operations have been performed to establish this as fact. It is also highly probable that Stalin is more loath to begin an offensive war than Mussolini or Hitler. He has less to gain from it, for Russia is a territory replete with abundant deposits of natural resources, while Italy and Germany are territories deficient in many essential raw materials.
今天，在所谓的俄罗斯共产主义独裁国家中，普通人可能比在所谓的德国和意大利法西斯独裁国家中受到更高的重视。 Ivan1甚至可能获得更大的相对配额的消费品和公共福利，但尚未进行任何操作来证实这一事实。斯大林也很可能比墨索里尼或希特勒更不愿意发动进攻性战争。他从中得到的好处较少，因为俄罗斯是一个自然资源丰富的国家，而意大利和德国则缺乏许多必需的原材料。
Sympathizers with the Russian form of dictatorship are afraid of attack by the so-called fascist dictatorships. Naturally they desire all the help they can get. So they make many statements about democratic governments’ supporting one another. Such statements are loud noises to me. The question I have to answer is this: As an American, do I love the people of Russia enough to urge the killing of tens of thousands of my people in a war against Germany, Italy, or Japan? The answer is no. I desire to see the people of Russia given a chance to work out one of the most significant economic experiments ever undertaken, but I am not prepared, as an American, to protect that experiment by force of arms. I remember too vividly the last time Americans ventured forth to make the world safe for democracy. If I were Ivan1, the case would be different.
俄罗斯独裁政权的同情者害怕所谓的法西斯独裁政权的攻击。他们自然希望得到一切能得到的帮助。因此他们发表了许多关于民主政府相互支持的声明。这样的言论对我来说是很大的噪音。我必须回答的问题是：作为一个美国人，我是否爱俄罗斯人民足以敦促在对德国、意大利或日本的战争中杀害数以万计的俄罗斯人民？答案是不。我希望看到俄罗斯人民有机会进行有史以来最重要的经济实验之一，但作为美国人，我不准备用武力保护这一实验。我对上次美国人冒险为民主世界创造安全的情景记忆犹新。如果我是 Ivan1，情况就会有所不同。
At this moment, a brazen invasion of France is going on. The Prussian militarist powers, in undisguised violation of their own signatures, of every canon of international law, of every principle of decency and humanity, are trying to crush the French people and their elected democratically constituted government. Apparently this does not matter to us. We sit by idly and contentedly, denying French democracy the means to defend itself. Neutrality followed to its logical conclusion has made America effectively pro-German.
此刻，一场对法国的悍然入侵正在进行。普鲁士军国主义列强毫不掩饰地违反了他们自己的签名、国际法的每一项准则、正派和人道的每一项原则，正试图镇压法国人民及其民选民主组成的政府。显然这对我们来说并不重要。我们袖手旁观，心满意足，否认法国民主有保卫自身的手段。中立的逻辑结论使美国实际上变得亲德。
Doesn’t that take one back to 1916? It was not written in 1916, however, but in 1937. I have followed Alfred Bingham in transposing a few words. The way Louis Fischer actually wrote the paragraph, published in the Nation, March 27, 1937, was this:
这不是让人回到1916年吗？然而，它不是写于 1916 年，而是写于 1937 年。我跟随阿尔弗雷德·宾厄姆 (Alfred Bingham) 换了几个词。路易斯·费舍尔 (Louis Fischer) 1937 年 3 月 27 日发表在《国家报》上的这段文字实际上是这样写的：
At this moment, a brazen invasion of Spain is going on. The fascist militarist powers, in undisguised violation of their own signatures . . . are trying to crush the Spanish people. . . . We sit by idly and contentedly, denying Spanish democracy the means to defend itself. Neutrality followed to its logical conclusion has made America effectively pro-fascist.
此刻，一场对西班牙的悍然入侵正在进行。法西斯军国主义列强，毫不掩饰地违背了自己的签名。 。 。正在试图压垮西班牙人民。 。 。 。我们袖手旁观，心满意足地袖手旁观，否认西班牙民主有保卫自己的手段。中立的逻辑结论使美国实际上成为了亲法西斯主义者。
Thus we find an emotive content similar to that of 1916, similar slogans, a similar call to cherish democracy. Mr. Fischer, I take it, is prepared, if necessary, to go to war to defend Russia. I am not. I am one of the greatest idle and contented sitters-by you ever saw.
因此，我们发现了与1916年类似的情感内容，类似的口号，类似的珍惜民主的呼吁。我认为，如果有必要，费舍尔先生准备为保卫俄罗斯而发动战争。我不是。我是你所见过的最无所事事、最心满意足的人之一。
I do not like dictators, especially those styled fascist, but I dislike the facts of modern warfare more. It may be argued—and is—that if Hitler gobbles up Russia, the United States will be next. One is reminded of the extrapolation of the geologists as to the age of the earth. Hitler has first to deal with Stalin’s army, and especially his air force. In the not-too-probable event that he conquered Russia, one suspects that he would have trouble enough trying to sit on the 180,000,000 Slavs stretched along two continents without being eager to sit on 130,000,000 Americans occupying a large section of a third continent. I outline this common argument not so much to refute it as to give a sample of the fantastic nature of many political arguments.
我不喜欢独裁者，尤其是那些法西斯式的独裁者，但我更不喜欢现代战争的事实。有人可能会说——而且确实如此——如果希特勒吞并俄罗斯，美国将是下一个。这让人想起地质学家对地球年龄的推断。希特勒首先要对付的是斯大林的军队，特别是他的空军。在不太可能发生的事件中，他征服了俄罗斯，有人怀疑，如果他试图坐拥横跨两大洲的 1.8 亿斯拉夫人，而不是急于坐拥占据第三大陆大部分地区的 1.3 亿美国人，那就够麻烦了。我概述这个常见的论点，与其说是为了反驳它，不如说是为了举例说明许多政治论点的奇妙本质。
If I do not want to go to war, then I must be a “pacifist.” Good Lord! Absolutes to the right of us, absolutes to the left of us. At times like these I am almost ready to go back to sign language. How would you call a man a pacifist with your hands? One reason why people who do not like military violence get into so many battles among themselves, and are on the whole so futile, is that they try to deal with “pacifism” as a timeless principle. Nearly every living animal will fight when cornered; the impulse is deep in the nervous mechanism of survival. Whether men will fight or not depends on a given set of circumstances at some given time and place. Nonresistance as a timeless principle is meaningless. To refuse to fight in a given war is a different matter, and often takes courage. Furthermore, to proclaim in advance what one will or will not do in some future situation is a branch of astrology. You do not know what you will do until you are in it. In the event of an unprovoked attack by air on your city, a military invasion of the country in which you live, a sudden revolutionary uprising on the streets as you are going home to lunch, your boy’s being choked to death by poison gas—how can you tell what you will do then?
如果我不想打仗，那么我就必须是一个“和平主义者”。主啊！绝对在我们右边，绝对在我们左边。在这样的时候，我几乎准备好回到手语了。你如何用你的双手称一个人为和平主义者？不喜欢军事暴力的人们之间发生如此多的争斗，并且总体上如此徒劳，原因之一是他们试图将“和平主义”视为一项永恒的原则。几乎所有活着的动物在走投无路时都会进行战斗。冲动深深存在于生存的神经机制中。男人是否会战斗取决于特定时间和地点的特定情况。不抵抗作为永恒的原则是没有意义的。拒绝参加一场特定的战争是另一回事，而且通常需要勇气。此外，提前宣布一个人在未来某种情况下会做什么或不会做什么，是占星学的一个分支。在你身临其境之前，你不知道自己会做什么。如果你的城市遭到无端的空袭，你居住的国家遭到军事入侵，你回家吃午饭时街头突然爆发革命起义，你的孩子被毒气窒息而死——如何应对？你能告诉你接下来你会做什么吗？
Opponents of “pacifism” make much of the well-known argument about the criminal attack upon your sister. Would you fight to protect her virtue? If so, you are no pacifist and not really opposed to war. Our old friend logic:
“和平主义”的反对者大肆宣扬关于对你妹妹的犯罪袭击的众所周知的论点。你会为了保护她的美德而战吗？如果是这样，你就不是和平主义者，也不是真正反对战争。我们的老朋友逻辑：
Major premise: War involves violence.
大前提：战争涉及暴力。
Minor premise: Those who defend their sisters use violence.
小前提：那些保护姐妹的人使用暴力。
Therefore: They are warriors.
因此：他们是战士。
Though the context of a criminal attack is entirely different from that of organized, deliberate warfare, both are cheerfully lumped together.
尽管犯罪袭击的背景与有组织的、蓄意的战争完全不同，但两者都被愉快地混为一谈。
Then I am not a “pacifist”? No, I am not a blab. On the principle of survival, I am opposed to taking action against the lives of the citizens of any country if there is a possible way to avoid it. Whether we should fight in a future war or not, or advocate fighting, depends on time, place, and nature of the provocation in an experience not yet encountered. My feeling is against war; what my body will do when the time comes, I cannot say.
那我就不是“和平主义者”了？不，我不是废话。出于生存的原则，如果有可能避免的话，我反对对任何国家公民的生命采取行动。未来的战争是否应该打仗，或者主张打仗，取决于时间、地点以及尚未遇到的挑衅的性质。我的感觉是反对战争；当时间到来时我的身体会做什么，我不能说。
A war of ideas is a contradiction in terms. An idea cannot be fought with guns. At best, aggression may sometimes be discouraged with guns, but aggression is an act. What usually happens is a sequence of reprisals, beginning with a disagreement over an idea—say Catholicism versus Protestantism, or fascism versus democracy. Even in a childish quarrel, the original disagreement tends to be lost in the bitterness of the fight about who began the fight. “You started it!” “I did not, you started it!” When the battle goes over from high words to physical violence, to reprisals, killings, and “atrocities,” the disagreement becomes insoluble. Faces must be saved, lives avenged. The struggle ends when fatigue and exhaustion exceed desire to pay the other fellow back. To this dreadful impasse do our words lead us.
思想之战是一种术语上的矛盾。一个想法不能用枪来对抗。最好的情况是，有时用枪可以阻止侵略，但侵略是一种行为。通常会发生一系列的报复，从对某个观念的分歧开始——比如天主教与新教，或者法西斯主义与民主。即使是在一场幼稚的争吵中，最初的分歧也往往会消失在关于是谁先开始争吵的激烈争斗中。 “你先开始的！” “我没有，是你开始的！”当战斗从高调言辞转向肢体暴力、报复、杀戮和“暴行”时，分歧就变得无法解决。必须保住面子，为生命报仇。当疲劳和疲惫超过了偿还对方的欲望时，斗争就结束了。我们的言语将我们引向了这个可怕的僵局。
The semantic danger in a so-called war of ideas is the identification of the idea with the physical tactics, real or alleged. Catholicism “is” the tortures of the Inquisition; communism “is” the execution of white Russians; imperial Germany “is” the cutting off hands of Belgian babies; fascism “is” the bombing of women and children in Madrid. Fortified with such identifications, opponents of these doctrines are ready to tear the world to pieces to stamp them out. While Hitler was squabbling with Catholics in Germany, a meeting took place at Madison Square Garden in New York at which strong sympathy was shown for General Franco and the Spanish rebels. One of the speakers was the Rev. Bernard Grimley of London, editor of the Catholic Times. He reduced the conflict to its simplest terms: “The issue,” he said, “is God or anti-God.” Thereby he identified God with General Franco, with German troops under Franco, and so with Hitler, who at the time was fighting God in Germany!
所谓思想战争中的语义危险是将思想与实际的或所谓的实际战术等同起来。天主教“是”宗教裁判所的酷刑；共产主义“是”对俄罗斯白人的处决；德意志帝国“正在”砍掉比利时婴儿的手；法西斯主义“就是”对马德里妇女和儿童的轰炸。有了这样的认同，这些学说的反对者就准备将世界撕成碎片，以消灭它们。当希特勒在德国与天主教徒发生争执时，在纽约麦迪逊广场花园举行了一次会议，会上对佛朗哥将军和西班牙叛军表示了强烈的同情。其中一位演讲者是伦敦的伯纳德·格里姆利牧师，他是《天主教时报》的编辑。他将冲突简化为最简单的术语：“问题是，”他说，“是上帝还是反上帝。”因此，他将上帝等同于佛朗哥将军、佛朗哥领导下的德国军队，以及当时正在德国与上帝作战的希特勒！
“Neutrality” is another troublesome abstraction. As an absolute, it can obviously never be defined, yet we witness laws, orations, public meetings, organizations, books, pamphlets, to enforce it. Nobody wants to enjoy a word “neutrality,” one wants Adam1 and Schmidt1 to forego the doubtful pleasure of blowing each other to bits. Steps can be taken to make a war more difficult to inaugurate, but “neutrality,” to have meaning, must be decided for each specific case. Neutrality of what kind? Where? When?
“中立”是另一个麻烦的抽象概念。作为绝对的，它显然永远无法被定义，但我们见证了法律、演讲、公开会议、组织、书籍、小册子来执行它。没有人愿意享受“中立”这个词，人们希望 Adam1 和 Schmidt1 放弃将对方炸成碎片的可疑乐趣。可以采取措施让战争更难爆发，但“中立”要想有意义，就必须根据具体情况来决定。什么样的中立？在哪里？什么时候？
What are “munitions of war”? This question is now perplexing statesmen and believers in peace. They hope to find an exact definition, and so prevent the export of munitions. The word is there, so of course the thing must be there. A little observation shows that referents for the term are impossible to locate, unless one wants to include practically every raw and processed material. The conditions of modern warfare and modern technology are such that a whole people is mobilized as well as the army, and nearly every mineral, foodstuff, and technical crop enters into mobilization requirements. Camera factories are turned into plants for making gun sights; cotton for dresses becomes guncotton, farm-tractor factories begin to throw tanks off the assembly line. In some cases, a line of paper credit is the best of all “munitions.” The pursuit of the word is hopeless. The best a given government can do is to list categorically certain materials that it will or will not export, with no illusions as to stopping trade in all “munitions.”
什么是“战争弹药”？这个问题现在困扰着政治家和和平信徒。他们希望找到一个准确的定义，从而阻止弹药出口。词在那里，所以东西当然也必须在那里。一点观察表明，除非想要包括几乎所有原材料和加工材料，否则不可能找到该术语的所指对象。现代战争和现代技术的条件是全民动员和军队动员，几乎所有矿产、粮食和技术作物都进入动员要求。相机工厂变成了制造枪械瞄准具的工厂；衣服用的棉变成了棉，农用拖拉机工厂开始将坦克从装配线上扔下来。在某些情况下，纸质信用额度是所有“弹药”中最好的。追求这个词是没有希望的。某个政府能做的最好的事情就是明确列出它将或不会出口的某些材料，而不抱有停止所有“弹药”贸易的幻想。
It has frequently been pointed out that war is unprofitable to a given country. Norman Angell wrote a famous book, The Great Illusion, emphasizing this. America lent the Allies money. The Allies paid only a fraction of the money back. So America lost billions, and we conclude that wars are unprofitable and should not be undertaken. Wait a moment. Who lent the Allies what? When we begin to analyze the concrete situation, we find that many American bankers made a very sweet thing out of war loans; many American businessmen made great sums of money out of goods ordered on the strength of war loans; many American workers held jobs at high wages out of war loans. That more people suffered than benefited in America may or may not be true. To draw flat conclusions about the unprofitableness of war for America is to misunderstand what actually happened and to complicate a realistic program for dealing with a future threat of war.
人们经常指出，战争对某个国家来说是无利可图的。诺曼·安吉尔写了一本著名的书《伟大的幻觉》，强调了这一点。美国借钱给同盟国。盟军只偿还了一小部分钱。因此，美国损失了数十亿美元，我们得出的结论是，战争是无利可图的，不应该进行。稍等。谁借给盟军什么？当我们开始分析具体情况时，我们发现许多美国银行家通过战争贷款赚了很多钱；许多美国商人通过战争贷款订购的商品赚了大钱。许多美国工人靠战争贷款获得高薪工作。在美国，受苦受难的人多于受益的人可能是真的，也可能不是。就战争对美国无利可图得出简单的结论，就是误解了实际发生的事情，并使应对未来战争威胁的现实计划变得复杂化。
Captain Liddell Hart has looked at the World War from another point of view, that of strategy and tactics. He says that both Allied and German generals went into the battle lines of 1914 filled to bursting with principles derived from Napoleon and Clausewitz. In their heads they visioned the struggle as a prancing open combat, with the big battalions always taking the offensive, and cavalry at full gallop. For months they would not hear of more than two machine guns per regiment, of trench mortars, gas, airplanes, or tanks, nor of saving man power by skirmish-line attacks.
利德尔·哈特上尉从战略和战术的另一个角度看待世界大战。他说，盟军和德国将军在 1914 年的战场上都充满了源自拿破仑和克劳塞维茨的原则。在他们的头脑中，他们把这场斗争想象成一场腾跃的公开战斗，大营总是采取进攻，骑兵则全速驰骋。几个月来，他们没有听说过每个团有超过两挺机枪、战壕迫击炮、毒气、飞机或坦克，也没有听说过通过小冲突线攻击来节省人力。
By adherence to the theoretical ideal of destroying the main army of the main enemy, the allied chiefs would forfeit one actual point after another. They would encourage Bulgaria to join the enemy alliance, allow their own ally Serbia to be overrun, let slip the chance of probing Austria’s weakness, and cause a great part of their own forces to be pinned down in the East and Near East throughout the war. During four years, they pursued an ideal without seriously asking whether conditions made it practicable.
如果坚持消灭主要敌人的主力部队的理论理想，盟军首领就会失去一个又一个实际分数。他们会鼓励保加利亚加入敌方联盟，让自己的盟友塞尔维亚被蹂躏，错过探查奥地利弱点的机会，并导致自己的大部分军队在整个战争期间被困在东部和近东。 。四年的时间里，他们追求一个理想，却没有认真地询问条件是否可行。
The man who finally got machine guns and tanks to the front and saved the British Army was a rank civilian—Mr. Lloyd George.
最终把机枪和坦克带到前线并拯救了英国军队的人是一位普通平民——先生。劳埃德·乔治.
Consider “free speech” as an absolute. Liberals criticize the government of Russia for denying free speech. When one mildly observes that Russians do not know what “free speech” means in the American sense, one’s head is snapped off. Free speech is declared to be free speech, everywhere, at all times. Only the morally obtuse would fail to live up to the great principle. If you are caught as I have been in the toils of a moral lecture on this subject, invite the moralist to go out on the street and shout a few selected four-letter words and see how long free speech is permitted him before the police arrive. “Freedom” is a relative term, having meaning only in specific contexts. In America, criticism of the government, of government officials, of industrial tycoons, of exalted members of the clergy, great bankers, and other high-muck-a-mucks is one of our highly valued privileges. To carry the concept over unmodified into Russia or Turkey or Japan is nonsensical. The context of situation has changed and the concept of free speech must change with it.
将“言论自由”视为绝对的。自由主义者批评俄罗斯政府剥夺言论自由。当人们温和地观察到俄罗斯人不知道美国意义上的“言论自由”意味着什么时，人们的头就会被折断。言论自由被宣布为随时随地的言论自由。只有道德愚钝的人，才会不遵守伟大的原则。如果你像我一样在这个主题的道德讲座中被抓住，请邀请道德家到街上大声喊出几个选定的四个字母的单词，看看在警察到达之前允许他自由言论多久。 “自由”是一个相对术语，仅在特定情况下才有意义。在美国，批评政府、政府官员、工业大亨、神职人员、伟大的银行家和其他高高在上的人是我们高度重视的特权之一。将这一概念不加修改地移植到俄罗斯、土耳其或日本是荒谬的。形势的背景已经改变，言论自由的概念也必须随之改变。
A newspaperman reported an interview with presidential candidate Harding in 1920 as follows:
一位报纸记者对 1920 年总统候选人哈丁的采访报道如下：
A Senator, distinguished, powerful, an astute leader with surpassing skill in political management, told me that Americanism was to be this year’s campaign issue. When I asked him what Americanism meant, he said that he did not know, but that it was a damned good word with which to carry an election.
一位杰出、有权有势、精明的领导人，在政治管理方面拥有超凡的技巧，他告诉我，美国主义将成为今年的竞选主题。当我问他“美国主义”是什么意思时，他说他不知道，但用它来进行选举却是一个该死的好词。
It was—in 1920. In 1936, Messrs. Landon and Knox found that it had worn a little stale.
那是在 1920 年。1936 年，兰登和诺克斯先生发现它已经有点陈旧了。
The Republican party is an elephant, the Democratic party a donkey. Outside of this zoological notation the differences are hard to find. As animated abstractions, the parties are worth a rousing fight. Men turn pale with anger as they discuss party politics. Semantically there is no “party” as an entity. The referents of the term are individual voters more or less controlled by local bosses. Observing them, we find they behave in substantially a similar way. The ins become the outs, and the outs become the ins. A majority of well-to-do people professes Republican sympathies in the North, Democratic sympathies in the South. Indeed the only measurable difference seems to be that Republicans pull one lever on the voting machine and Democrats another. The election of 1936 was decided by the relative strength of those who liked Mr. Roosevelt as against those who did not. This is not to say that political parties are a fantasy and should be abolished, only that in discussing politics it is well to keep abstraction levels clear and find real differences, if any. In many countries we find perceptible differences between liberal and conservative blocs; not so as a rule in the United States. The indications are that this situation is likely to change before long.
共和党是大象，民主党是驴。在这种动物学符号之外，很难发现差异。作为生动的抽象概念，派对值得一场激动人心的战斗。男人们在讨论政党政治时气得脸色苍白。从语义上讲，不存在作为实体的“政党”。该术语所指的是或多或少受当地老板控制的个人选民。观察它们，我们发现它们的行为方式基本相似。由进变为出，由出变为进。大多数富裕人士在北方表示同情共和党，在南方表示同情民主党。事实上，唯一可衡量的差异似乎是共和党人在投票机上拉动一个杠杆，而民主党人则拉动另一个杠杆。 1936 年的选举是根据喜欢罗斯福先生的人和不喜欢罗斯福先生的人的相对力量来决定的。这并不是说政党是一种幻想，应该废除，只是说在讨论政治时最好保持抽象层次清晰，并发现真正的差异（如果有的话）。在许多国家，我们发现自由派和保守派之间存在明显的差异。在美国通常情况并非如此。种种迹象表明，这种情况可能很快就会改变。
During Franklin Roosevelt’s first administration, conservatives and businessmen opposed increasingly the extension of authority at Washington. The lawyers of the Liberty League even went so far as to counsel corporations to disobey such federal statutes as the Wagner Act and the Holding Company Act, feeling confident that the Supreme Court would nullify them in due course of “due process.” Many of the larger utilities, in violation of the act, refused to register with the Securities Exchange Commission. The conservatives professed themselves enchanted with the principle of states rights as against the Federal Government. The radicals were strong supporters of an extension of federal powers. Then came the wave of sit-down strikes in the early months of 1937. The conservatives deserted their well-loved states and called for strong central measures, demanding the Federal incorporation of unions and Congressional power to deal belligerently with sit-down strikers. The radicals abruptly deserted Washington and cried for “Hands off Labor.” Thus each side scrambled to the other’s dogma. The usual procedure would be to accuse them of inconsistency. To the student of semantics, on the contrary, the scramble was a sensible performance. The story shows how impossible it is to be “consistent” about federalism or states rights when conditions change.
在富兰克林·罗斯福第一届政府期间，保守派和商人越来越反对华盛顿扩大权力。自由联盟的律师甚至建议企业违反《瓦格纳法》和《控股公司法》等联邦法规，他们相信最高法院会在适当的“正当程序”中宣布这些法规无效。许多较大的公用事业公司违反了该法案，拒绝在证券交易委员会注册。保守派声称自己对州权相对于联邦政府的原则着迷。激进分子是扩大联邦权力的坚定支持者。随后，1937 年初出现了静坐罢工浪潮。保守派抛弃了他们深爱的州，呼吁采取强有力的中央措施，要求联邦政府纳入工会，并赋予国会权力，以武力对付静坐罢工者。激进分子突然抛弃了华盛顿，并呼吁“放手工党”。因此，双方都争先恐后地接受对方的教条。通常的程序是指责他们不一致。相反，对于语义学的学生来说，争夺是一种明智的表现。这个故事表明，当情况发生变化时，要在联邦制或州权利方面保持“一致”是多么不可能。
Dr. Charles A. Beard reviews certain proposals for improving the administration of the American Government. The first demon which he encounters is the common belief that there are some functions which the government can “properly” undertake and others which are “improper.” It was proper for a while for the unemployed to make mattresses for themselves, but later this was found to be improper. The next demon is the neat verbal segregation into “legislative” and “administrative” functions. These functions can no more be separated in fact than can those of investor and speculator. “The isolation of the executive from the legislative is impossible, except in books for grade-school children.”
查尔斯·A·比尔德博士审查了改善美国政府管理的某些建议。他遇到的第一个恶魔是一种普遍的信念，即政府可以“适当”承担某些职能，而另一些职能则“不适当”。失业者为自己做床垫一度是正当的，但后来发现这是不恰当的。下一个恶魔是“立法”和“行政”职能在口头上的整齐划分。事实上，这些功能就像投资者和投机者的功能一样不可分割。 “行政部门与立法部门的分离是不可能的，除非是针对小学生的书籍。”
Some of the engineers engaged in administrative reorganization fell into the superb error of assuming that public works should be taken out of the several departments and segregated in one department. All had the same name, and the conclusion followed that all therefore must be identical. It was seriously proposed, for example, that the building of roads and trails through the national forests should be taken out of the Forest Service and put into the Public Works Department with the rest of the roads. But the nature of these woodland roads, their location and‘structure, are matters related peculiarly to the purposes of forestry. In actual practice, the theory of grouping administrative offices according to kindred names breaks down at innumerable points. “The controlling issue,” concludes Dr. Beard, “becomes one of the human purposes to be accomplished.”
一些从事行政整顿的工程师犯了一个极其错误的想法，认为公共工程应该从几个部门中分离出来，集中在一个部门中。所有这些都具有相同的名称，因此得出的结论是所有这些都必须是相同的。例如，有人认真提议，穿过国家森林的道路和小径的建设应从林务局中移出，并与其余道路一起纳入公共工程部。但这些林地道路的性质、它们的位置和结构，是与林业目的特别相关的问题。在实践中，按姓分署的理论有无数的缺陷。比尔德博士总结道：“控制问题成为人类要实现的目标之一。”
I know of no better advice with which to close this chapter. The controlling issue, the real task for statesmen, is to find the human purpose to be accomplished in a given situation.
我不知道有什么更好的建议来结束这一章。控制问题是政治家的真正任务，是找到在特定情况下要实现的人类目标。
Chapter XIX
第十九章
ON FACING THE WORLD OUTSIDE
关于面对外面的世界
I HAVE made little effort in the foregoing pages to develop a theory of semantics. I have sought to give the reactions of a layman to certain aspects of this new discipline. My interest, of course, is far from academic, because words are the tools of my trade. With such a trade, one must be on the lookout for methods of improving communication. Semantics promises such a method, and it excites me as a craftsman; more, it seems to promise a revolution in the process of thinking.
在前面的几页中，我几乎没有付出什么努力来发展语义理论。我试图给出外行人对这门新学科某些方面的反应。当然，我的兴趣远非学术，因为文字是我的交易工具。对于这样的交易，人们必须寻找改善沟通的方法。语义学承诺了这样一种方法，它让我作为一个工匠感到兴奋；更重要的是，它似乎预示着思维过程的一场革命。
When one becomes aware of the pitfalls of language, an avalanche of illustrations rolls in. . . . Have you read Senator Wheeler’s speech? . . . Have you seen what Goebbels said about literature? . . . Did you hear Al Smith on the radio? . . . Did you read Walter Lippmann this morning? . . . Have you seen Mussolini’s note on Spain? . . . Did you tune in on Nicholas Murray Butler? . . . Did you hear the Right Rev. William T. Manning on the state of the world? . . . Did you see what Millikan said about science and religion? . . . Have you translated Henry Ford’s latest contribution to economic philosophy? . . .
当人们意识到语言的陷阱时，大量的插图就会滚滚而来。 。 。你读过惠勒参议员的演讲吗？ 。 。 。你看过戈培尔对文学的评价吗？ 。 。 。你在收音机里听到阿尔·史密斯了吗？ 。 。 。今天早上你读过沃尔特·李普曼的书吗？ 。 。 。你看过墨索里尼关于西班牙的笔记吗？ 。 。 。您收听尼古拉斯·默里·巴特勒吗？ 。 。 。您听过右翼牧师威廉·T·曼宁 (William T. Manning) 对世界现状的看法吗？ 。 。 。你看到密立根关于科学和宗教的言论了吗？ 。 。 。您翻译了亨利·福特对经济哲学的最新贡献吗？ 。 。 。
The student of semantics is embarrassed with the sheer richness of the evidence that people do not know what they are talking about. A business conference, the Congressional Record, a meeting of a Board of Education, the proceedings of almost any annual convention, a get-together of pacifists, of the Daughters of the American Revolution, of communists, of delegates to the A.F. of L., a banquet of the bar association. Words, words, words, making blab, sense, blab, blab, sense, blab; a thin white flicker of meaning on a broad black band.
语义学的学生对人们不知道自己在说什么的证据之丰富感到尴尬。商业会议、国会记录、教育委员会会议、几乎所有年度大会的会议记录、和平主义者、美国革命女儿会、共产主义者、L. AF 代表的聚会。 ，律师协会的一场宴会。词，词，词，胡言乱语，意义，胡言乱语，胡言乱语，意义，胡言乱语；宽阔的黑色带子上闪烁着淡淡的白色光芒。
From 1870 to 1914 in the United States this kind of thing did not make so much difference. Men were busy overrunning a continent, and words could not seriously deflect the course of hustling and impetuous action. But those of us who have lived through the Great War, the Great Boom, the Great Depression, and now observe the rise of the dictators abroad are not so easy in our minds as were our fathers in the days of Cleveland and McKinley. Even if not caught in an active catastrophe of fighting, financial ruin, personal suppression, deportation, or violence, one reads the headlines morning after morning with a kind of dazed incredulity. Has the planet begun to spin in the wrong direction? Is the oxygen leaving the atmosphere? Is agricultural mass production taking essential vitamins out of foodstuffs and slowly poisoning us? What is the matter with people? What is the matter with governments? What is the matter with me?
从1870年到1914年，这种事情在美国并没有产生太大的影响。人们正忙着占领整个大陆，言语无法严重改变忙碌和鲁莽行动的方向。但我们这些经历过第一次世界大战、大繁荣、大萧条，现在目睹国外独裁者崛起的人，心里并不像克利夫兰和麦金莱时代的父辈那样轻松。即使没有陷入战斗、经济崩溃、个人镇压、驱逐或暴力等活跃的灾难中，人们也会带着一种茫然的怀疑而日复一日地阅读头条新闻。地球是否开始朝错误的方向旋转？氧气会离开大气吗？农业大规模生产是否会从食品中夺走必需的维生素并慢慢毒害我们？人怎么了？政府出了什么问题？我这是怎么了？
First a war that killed thirty million human beings. Then a speculative boom which, after producing more bad language to sell more fantastic propositions than in the entire previous history of finance, exploded like the airship Hindenburg. Finally, when a little headway has been made against economic disaster, the peoples of Europe, more civilized than any other living group, prepare solemnly and deliberately to blow one another to molecules. Schmidt1, Ivan1, Giuseppe1, and Anatole1. do not want to blow one another to molecules, but by a course as relentless as a Greek tragedy they now move, white-faced and slow, to that end.
首先是一场导致三千万人死亡的战争。然后，投机热潮在产生了比整个以前的金融史上更多的脏话来兜售更多奇妙的主张之后，像兴登堡号飞艇一样爆炸了。最后，当在应对经济灾难方面取得了一点进展时，欧洲人民比任何其他生活群体都更加文明，他们庄严而故意地准备将彼此炸成分子。施密特 1、伊万 1、朱塞佩 1 和阿纳托尔 1。他们不想把彼此炸成分子，但他们现在脸色苍白，缓慢地朝着这一目标迈进，就像一场希腊悲剧一样无情。
Confusions persist and increase because we have no true picture of the world outside, and so cannot talk to one another about how to stop them. Again and again I come back to the image of the map. How can we arrive at a given destination by following a grossly inaccurate map, especially when each adventurer has a map with different inaccuracies? Better language can clear away many nonexistent locations which clutter the maps we now carry. It will help us talk sensibly with one another as to where we are, why we are here, and what we must do to get there. If the characteristics of people and groups are in fact different from the characteristics our charts and theories ascribe to them, the charts are dangerous, and we run into reefs instead of sailing through open channels. If people do not in fact behave as our ideas of “fascism” expect them to behave, we are rendered helpless in dealing with the happenings which go under that label.
混乱持续存在并不断加剧，因为我们对外部世界没有真实的了解，因此无法相互讨论如何阻止它们。我一次又一次地回到地图的形象上。我们如何能够通过一张极其不准确的地图到达指定目的地，尤其是当每个冒险家都有一张具有不同不准确度的地图时？更好的语言可以清除许多不存在的位置，这些位置使我们现在携带的地图变得混乱。它将帮助我们明智地相互讨论我们在哪里、为什么在这里以及我们必须做什么才能到达那里。如果人和群体的特征实际上与我们的星图和理论赋予他们的特征不同，那么星图就是危险的，我们就会陷入礁石，而不是通过开放的航道航行。如果人们实际上没有按照我们的“法西斯主义”观念所期望的那样行事，那么我们在处理该标签下发生的事件时就会变得无助。
Language is perhaps the most human of all human attributes. It is what sets us off most sharply from the higher animals. It is part and parcel of our minds, and of the relatively greater size of our brains. No record exists of any tribe which could not talk. Is it a wild extrapolation to suppose that language and human beings appeared together on the evolutionary stage, that as the brain grew, speech grew? What can be more important than to appreciate, understand, and consciously develop this most human activity? It is extraordinarily difficult, but the facing and overcoming of extraordinary difficulties is another very human attribute. I give you Captain Scott on his march to the South Pole.
语言也许是所有人类属性中最人性化的。这是我们与高等动物最明显的区别。它是我们思想的重要组成部分，也是我们大脑相对较大的一部分。没有任何记录表明任何部落不会说话。假设语言和人类一起出现在进化阶段，随着大脑的成长，语言也随之发展，这是一种疯狂的推断吗？还有什么比欣赏、理解和有意识地发展这种最人类的活动更重要的呢？这是异常困难的，但面对和克服异常困难是另一个非常人性的属性。我向您介绍斯科特船长向南极进军的情况。
To hold that no language would be better than bad language may be permissible in formal logic, but not in practical affairs. We should be wary of linguistic nihilism. Language we must have to be human; our word stocks are ample. There is little fault to be found with the words we use, much with the way we use them. The best of guns does not hit every target at which it is aimed. One has first to learn to shoot. And one must be careful not to shoot himself.
认为没有语言比坏语言更好的观点在形式逻辑中可能是允许的，但在实际事务中则不然。我们应该警惕语言虚无主义。我们的语言必须是人类的；我们的词汇库很充足。我们使用的词语几乎没有什么错误，但我们使用它们的方式却有很大的错误。最好的枪并不能击中它所瞄准的所有目标。一个人首先要学会射击。而且必须小心，不要开枪自杀。
Semantic analysis helps to explain many baffling contradictions. Why are Christian preachers so ferocious in time of war? Why do well-to-do church members oppose laws against child labor so bitterly? Why is Tammany Hall, the notorious den of political brigands, so kind to poor people? Why do great scientists like Eddington and Millikan bring Heaven into their deductions if not into their experiments? Why are radicals so bent upon exterminating one another through factional splits? Why do socialist mayors call out the police to beat up strikers? Why are people with deplorable opinions frequently pleasant to talk to? Why do moral sinners often have such a good time? Why can’t we find the money to finance better living-conditions when we readily find it to finance better dying-conditions? Why is a balanced budget no longer a sacred symbol when a nation goes to war? Why is the right of private property enforced in many areas but not in the anthracite coal district of Pennsylvania? Why do we close down factories when unemployment is spreading? Why do all of us have such a dreadful time living up to our principles?
语义分析有助于解释许多令人困惑的矛盾。为什么基督教传教士在战争时期如此凶残？为什么富裕的教会成员如此强烈地反对禁止童工的法律？为什么臭名昭著的政治强盗巢穴坦慕尼协会对穷人如此友善？为什么像爱丁顿和密立根这样的伟大科学家即使不将天堂带入他们的实验，也要将天堂带入他们的推论中？为什么激进分子如此热衷于通过派系分裂来消灭彼此？为什么社会党市长要出动警察殴打罢工者？为什么持有令人遗憾的观点的人往往很容易与之交谈？为什么道德上的罪人常常过得这么开心？当我们很容易找到资金来改善死亡条件时，为什么我们却找不到资金来改善生活条件呢？为什么当一个国家陷入战争时，平衡预算不再是一个神圣的象征？为什么私有财产权在许多地区得到执行，但在宾夕法尼亚州的无烟煤区却没有得到落实？当失业蔓延时，我们为什么要关闭工厂？为什么我们所有人在遵守原则时都会经历如此可怕的时刻？
Such questions have haunted me for years. A certain cheap satisfaction can be derived by exposing contradictions in the opinions of those one does not agree with, but how about the alarming contradictions in one’s own opinions and behavior? When one sees clearly that most principles, as currently affirmed, are unattainable because they have no contact with reality, the pain of such contradictions is eased. If a man affirms that his purpose in life is to jump over the moon and he does not do it, you are not grieved because poor humanity does not live up to its principles. Many principles will be found to be moon-jumps when referents are sought for. Poor humanity is not indulging so much in moral failure as in bad language. As situations change, workable principles must change, as we saw in the case of “time” and “length.”
这些问题多年来一直困扰着我。揭露那些不同意的人的观点中的矛盾可以得到某种廉价的满足，但是自己的观点和行为中令人震惊的矛盾又如何呢？当人们清楚地看到，目前所确认的大多数原则都是因为与现实脱节而无法实现时，这种矛盾带来的痛苦就会减轻。如果一个人声称他的人生目标是跳过月球，但他没有这么做，你不会感到悲伤，因为可怜的人性没有遵守其原则。当寻找参照物时，许多原则会被发现是无稽之谈。可怜的人性与其说是沉迷于道德失败，不如说是沉迷于脏话。随着情况的变化，可行的原则必须改变，正如我们在“时间”和“长度”的例子中看到的那样。
As the pain of contradiction goes, many tight, rigid moral judgments go with it. Hatreds for ideas now known to be unattainable dissolve, together with clenched resentments and suspicions. Moon-jumps no longer keep one bad-tempered and suffering from indigestion. One begins to concentrate on situations of fact rather than on a game of anagrams. The reformer shifts his base from bitter resentment of what the other crowd is saying to an examination of what the other crowd is actually doing, and what it can do within the severe limitations of historical trends and changes. “Capitalists” cease to be demons and become human beings when one realizes that most capitalist principles are moon-jumps, and that inventors are forcing changes in social and financial institutions regardless of what noises Morgan1 may care to make with his mouth. Per contra, semantic students of a conservative turn of mind may discount the utopias of the radicals as so many moon-jumps.
随着矛盾的痛苦消失，许多严格、僵化的道德判断也随之而来。对现在已知无法实现的想法的仇恨以及紧握的怨恨和怀疑都消失了。跳月不再使人脾气暴躁或消化不良。人们开始专注于事实情况而不是字谜游戏。改革者将他的基础从对其他群体所说的话的强烈不满转向审视其他群体实际上在做什么，以及在历史趋势和变化的严格限制下他们可以做什么。当人们意识到大多数资本主义原则都是登月，并且无论摩根1可能想用嘴发出什么样的声音时，发明家都在迫使社会和金融机构发生变化，“资本家”就不再是恶魔，而是成为人类了。相反，持保守心态的语义学学生可能会将激进派的乌托邦视为许多月球跳跃。
Adam1 comes into the world equipped by the evolutionary process with certain characteristics, with senses, nervous system, muscular structure, which enable him to meet his environment and survive. Hobie Baker comes into the world in a similar manner. Man, unlike a cat, has developed a language which can help him, and has helped him, to find his way around the macroscopic world. What he sees with his eyes and describes with his tongue is not necessarily a true picture of the environment, but it has been good enough for purposes of survival. The human population has overrun the whole land surface of the planet where life is tenable. An immense amount of unnecessary hardship and suffering has been caused in the past by word magic and the personification of abstractions, but not enough to check seriously the increase in the species.
Adam1在进化过程中来到这个世界，具有一定的特征，具有感官、神经系统、肌肉结构，使他能够适应环境并生存。霍比·贝克以类似的方式来到这个世界。与猫不同，人已经发展出一种语言，可以帮助他，并且已经帮助他在宏观世界中找到出路。他用眼睛看到的、用舌头描述的不一定是环境的真实写照，但对于生存来说已经足够了。人口已经占领了地球上所有可以生存生命的陆地表面。过去，文字魔法和抽象概念的拟人化已经造成了大量不必要的困难和痛苦，但还不足以认真遏制物种的增长。
Around 1600, the scientific method began to make headway. Out of it came a series of deductions about the nature of physical processes, and a series of inventions which have operated further to increase population, release great stores of energy from coal, oil, and falling water, and produce the complicated and highly specialized culture in which we now find ourselves. The scientists have consistently bettered their language, especially by developing mathematics. They had to if they were to talk intelligently about what their experiments showed. The rest of us have not improved ordinary language. Its structure is no more reliable than in the days of Aristotle, or of the cave man, for that matter.
1600年左右，科学方法开始取得进展。由此产生了一系列关于物理过程本质的推论，以及一系列发明，这些发明进一步增加了人口，从煤炭、石油和落水中释放出大量能量，并产生了复杂且高度专业化的文化我们现在就身处其中。科学家们不断提高他们的语言，特别是通过发展数学。如果他们想要明智地谈论他们的实验结果，他们就必须这样做。我们其他人的日常语言并没有得到改善。就此而言，它的结构并不比亚里士多德或穴居人的时代更可靠。
The more complicated culture becomes, the less reliable, relatively, is ordinary language. We have seen how the printing press, the radio, advertising, propaganda, increase the havoc. At what point befuddlement becomes a dominating characteristic, and the needle swings to antisurvival, no one can say. We desperately need a language structure for the clear communication of observations, deductions, and ideas concerning the environment in which we live today. The suggestions outlined in this book may not be good enough, but is there anyone who will not agree that some kind of semantic discipline is essential? Is there anyone who will not agree that, could the right kind be found, it would be a mandatory study for the following?
文化越复杂，普通语言相对来说就越不可靠。我们已经看到印刷机、广播、广告、宣传如何加剧破坏。没有人能说清楚，在什么时候迷惑会成为一种主导特征，而指针会转向反生存。我们迫切需要一种语言结构来清晰地交流有关我们当今生活环境的观察、推论和想法。本书中概述的建议可能不够好，但是有人会不同意某种语义规则是必要的吗？是否有人不同意，如果能找到合适的类型，这将成为以下的强制性研究？

And all consumers of the verbal output from the above classes—just in case the goods are not as advertised. Semantics might be called a testing bureau for the consumer of language.
以及上述类别的口头输出的所有消费者——以防商品不像广告中那样。语义学可以被称为语言消费者的测试局。
A good semantic discipline gives the power to separate mental machinery from tangible events; makes us conscious of abstracting; prevents us from peopling the universe with nonexistent things. It does not dispense with poetry, fiction, fantasy, imagination, ideas, intellectual emotions. It checks us from acting as if fantasies were real events worth fighting and dying for. It checks a kind of dangerous hypnotism, abnormal reversals of nerve currents, mental states approaching insanity.
良好的语义规则能够将心理机制与有形事件区分开来。让我们意识到抽象；阻止我们在宇宙中填充不存在的事物。它并不缺少诗歌、小说、幻想、想象、思想、理智情感。它阻止我们表现得好像幻想是值得为之奋斗和牺牲的真实事件。它检查一种危险的催眠术、神经电流的异常逆转、接近疯狂的精神状态。
Abstractions we must use. But as we use them, we should look as it were over their edges and ask:
我们必须使用抽象。但当我们使用它们时，我们应该超越它们的边缘并问：
What is really happening out there?
那里到底发生了什么？
How do the facts really hang together out there?
事实是如何真正联系在一起的？
What are people really doing out there?
人们到底在外面做什么？
We are creatures of our environment. Take away air and in five minutes we perish. Take away water and we are dead in a few days. The basic data are the “me,” the outside world, and the senses which connect the two. The road to understanding for Adam1, as for Hobie Baker, is through experience with the outside world. There is no proof except in reference to that world. At the bottom, below the philosophies, logics, cults, fashions in thinking, this is all we poor creatures have to hold to. The mighty “truths,” the powerful and protecting entities we build up in our heads, are unprovable. Presently they desert us.
我们是环境的生物。失去空气，五分钟后我们就会灭亡。拿掉水，几天后我们就会死掉。基本数据是“我”、外部世界以及连接两者的感官。与霍比·贝克一样，亚当1的理解之路是通过对外部世界的体验。除了提到那个世界之外，没有任何证据。在底层，在哲学、逻辑、邪教、思维时尚之下，这就是我们这些可怜的生物必须坚持的一切。强大的“真理”，我们在头脑中建立的强大且具有保护作用的实体，是无法证明的。现在他们抛弃了我们。
This study turns utterly away from them. This study clings to the only things in the long run which can have meaning, which can develop knowledge, which can hopefully make men five closer to the possibilities of their extraordinary mental structure. Mr. Eddington, Mr. Jeans, Mr. Millikan, even Mr. Wells, keep running off the reservation, trying to find some Great Hand to grasp. This study stays on the reservation, afraid that Great Hands in 1938 are no more dependable than Great Hands in 5000 B.C. They let you down, these Hands, because some day somebody finds out that they are but words in a skull. I am tired of them, and I believe that I am not alone. We shall be called materialists. Let it go. Let them all go—every last watertight, pigeonhole term ever invented. For those who have followed Einstein and Bridgman in their destruction of concepts of “absolute substance,” “materialism” is a foolish symbol. We are done with rigid principles which exist only in the brain.
这项研究完全背离了他们。这项研究坚持从长远来看唯一有意义的事物，它可以发展知识，这有望使五人更接近其非凡心理结构的可能性。爱丁顿先生、吉恩斯先生、密立根先生，甚至威尔斯先生，都不断地逃离保留地，试图找到一位可以抓住的大手。这项研究仍处于保留状态，担心 1938 年的伟人并不比公元前 5000 年的伟人更可靠。他们让你失望了，这些手，因为有一天有人发现他们只是头骨中的文字。我厌倦了他们，我相信我并不孤单。我们将被称为唯物主义者。放手吧。让它们全部消失——所有发明的最后一个无懈可击的、分类的术语。对于那些跟随爱因斯坦和布里奇曼摧毁“绝对实体”概念的人来说，“唯物主义”是一个愚蠢的象征。我们已经厌倦了只存在于大脑中的严格原则。
The lesson of this study is to beware of eternal certainties. There are none which the fingers of experiment can verify. There is no perfect “truth,” “happiness,” “Heaven,” “peace.” To rely upon them is to feel hopeful before being betrayed. Look to the context. Find the referent. What is true about this? What is useful about that? What possibilities of survival and happiness may be found here? Not up in the Beyond—here! With this open-mindedness, flexibility, skepticism, perhaps men can find many more things which are true, which bring a measure of peace and happiness, than were ever assumed in an abstract Heaven.
这项研究的教训是要警惕永恒的确定性。没有任何一个是可以通过实验来验证的。不存在完美的“真理”、“幸福”、“天堂”、“和平”。依靠他们就等于在被背叛之前感到充满希望。看上下文。找到参照物。这件事的真相是什么？那有什么用呢？在这里可以找到什么生存和幸福的可能性？不是在彼岸——这里！凭借这种开放的思想、灵活性和怀疑精神，也许人们可以发现更多真实的事物，从而带来一定程度的和平与幸福，而不是在抽象的天堂中所假设的。
When men use their hands and minds in the disciplines of science, of art, music, poetry, their knowledge and well-being advance. When they use their minds for establishing eternal laws and principles in philosophy, economics, jurisprudence, theology, politics, then the good life falters, and often turns most evil. The age-old disagreements in these studies will continue until, as Hogben says, “we make the language of science part of the language of mankind, and realize that the future of human reason lies with those who are prepared to face the task of rationally planning the instruments of communication.”
当人们在科学、艺术、音乐、诗歌等学科中运用他们的双手和思想时，他们的知识和福祉就会进步。当他们用自己的头脑在哲学、经济学、法学、神学、政治学中建立永恒的法则和原则时，美好的生活就会动摇，并且常常变成最邪恶的。正如霍格本所说，这些研究中由来已久的分歧将持续下去，直到“我们使科学语言成为人类语言的一部分，并意识到人类理性的未来取决于那些准备好理性地面对任务的人”。规划通讯工具。”
The promise of the semantic discipline lies in broadening the base of agreement. Under the going canons of philosophy, theology, and the rest, there is no possibility of wide agreement. Referents are too few. There is little, in these studies, which A can point out to B and say: “That is what I am talking about; go and touch it. Now do you see what I mean?” Ideas and purposes lie beyond the facts. B cannot touch and see what A sees. One believes or does not believe, and between believer and nonbeliever lie bitterness, discord, and sometimes death.
语义学科的前景在于扩大共识的基础。在哲学、神学和其他学科的现行准则下，不可能达成广泛的一致。参考文献太少了。在这些研究中，A 几乎没有什么可以向 B 指出并说：“这就是我所说的；去触摸它。现在你明白我的意思了吧？”想法和目的超出了事实。 B 无法触摸和看到 A 所看到的内容。一个人相信或不相信，信徒和非信徒之间存在着痛苦、不和，有时甚至是死亡。
Dictators can force a kind of duress agreement on the formula of “Agree with me or be shot.” It is not very helpful. Primitive men cannot reach agreement in their magical realms of good and evil spirits. Even the rationalists cannot achieve it, for they hold to reason alone, uncontaminated by the outside world. The scientists above all others have won agreement. With it has come an incomparable advance in knowledge, an incomparable opportunity to provide material well-being for every member of the race. The knowledge works. Can we follow the discipline, modified to a different context, and find agreement in the more troubled and perhaps more complicated fields of social and economic affairs?

Not unless we can talk clearly. Good language alone will not save mankind. But seeing the things behind the names will help us to understand the structure of the world we live in. Good language will help us to communicate with one another about the realities of our environment, where now we speak darkly, in alien tongues.

We need a new religion. The elder faiths have followed the economic secular trend downward. The system called capitalism, for all its sprinkling with holy water in the nineteenth century, is at heart irreligious, without internal unity or public spirit, often a mere congeries of possessors and pursuers. When it adopted as its basic principles the competition of tooth and claw and the supreme duty of selfishness, all the holy water in the cosmos could not disinfect it. Great religious movements have usually been grounded in collectivism, in the brotherhood of man, leaving laissez faire, in the last analysis, a cold and ferocious anti-Christ. Capitalism, though officially blessed by Christian priests, has all but killed Christianity. Western mankind is thirsty for something in which to believe again.
我们需要一种新的宗教。老派信仰追随经济长期趋势的下滑。被称为资本主义的制度尽管在十九世纪洒满了圣水，但本质上是不宗教的，没有内部团结或公共精神，往往只是占有者和追求者的集合体。当它以牙齿与爪子的竞争和自私至上的义务为基本原则时，宇宙中所有的圣水都无法消毒它。伟大的宗教运动通常以集体主义和人类兄弟情谊为基础，而归根结底，自由放任主义是冷酷而凶猛的反基督。资本主义虽然得到了基督教牧师的正式祝福，但却几乎扼杀了基督教。西方人类渴望再次相信某种东西。
This is a fearful hash. “Capitalism” is objectified as a thing on which holy water can be sprinkled, and then rigidly identified with “anti-Christ,” whatever that may be. “Capitalism,” it appears, has wounded “Christianity” if not slaughtered it outright. Another spook called “Western mankind” is working up a thirst for a large beaker of “religion.” The identification of capitalism with laissez faire is vague and confusing. All priests certainly did not bless capitalism. Translating a few lines into blabs:
这是一个可怕的哈希值。 “资本主义”被客观化为可以洒圣水的东西，然后严格地与“反基督”等同起来，无论它是什么。看来，“资本主义”即使没有彻底屠杀“基督教”，也已经伤害了它。另一位被称为“西方人类”的幽灵正对一大杯“宗教”产生渴望。将资本主义与自由放任等同起来是模糊且令人困惑的。当然，并不是所有的牧师都祝福资本主义。将几行翻译成废话：
We need a new religion. The blab faiths have followed the blab blab trend downward. The blab called capitalism, for all its sprinkling with holy water in the nineteenth century, is blab blab, without blab blab or blab blab, often a mere congeries of blabs and blabs. When it blabbed as its blab blabs . . .
我们需要一种新的宗教。胡言乱语的信仰也跟着胡言乱语的趋势下降。被称为资本主义的废话，尽管在十九世纪洒满了圣水，却是废话，没有废话，也没有废话，常常只是废话和废话的混合体。当它胡言乱语时。 。 。
The reader is invited to continue the exercise. As it stands, the exhibit is all but meaningless. I had, however, an idea. Let me see if I can rephrase the monstrosity, and communicate this idea:
请读者继续练习。就目前而言，展览几乎毫无意义。不过，我有一个主意。让我看看我是否可以重新表述这个怪物，并传达这个想法：
Established religious organizations are losing their members (1933). The economic arrangements of the nineteenth century in Western countries—often called capitalism—were approved by many church officials. These arrangements, however, tended to produce slums, disease, and misery for many working people, and to put a premium on disagreement between Adam1, a businessman, and Adam2, his competitor. Religious organizations stress the principle of the brotherhood of man, and so contradict such economic practice. When priests blessed the economic system, their followers naturally became confused, and many of them are now looking around for a religion which better lives up to its principles.
已建立的宗教组织正在失去其成员（1933）。西方国家十九世纪的经济安排——通常被称为资本主义——得到了许多教会官员的认可。然而，这些安排往往会给许多劳动人民带来贫民窟、疾病和痛苦，并加剧商人亚当1和他的竞争对手亚当2之间的分歧。宗教组织强调人类兄弟情谊的原则，因此与这种经济实践相矛盾。当牧师祝福经济体系时，他们的追随者自然会感到困惑，他们中的许多人现在正在寻找一种更能遵循其原则的宗教。
This statement has more dependable referents and makes more sense than the first, but so translated I am not clearly so sure as I was in writing the original that the observation is valid. The emotion has been stewed out of it, and it seems a pretty dubious pronouncement. I doubt if church members were alienated because their parsons did not attack capitalists. A better hypothesis might be that the members became increasingly bored, and that Hollywood and the radio put on a better show. I am not sure that most people demand the certainties of a religious dogma. They apparently did in the past, but a past context is always different from a present one. I suspect that the paragraph was really written because I wanted church people to join with me in trying to get rid of slums, poverty, and economic misery. Well, why didn’t I say so?
这个陈述比第一个陈述有更可靠的指称，也更有意义，但这样翻译后，我并没有像在写原文时那样清楚地确定观察是有效的。情绪已经被淡化了，这似乎是一个相当可疑的声明。我怀疑教会成员是否因为他们的牧师不攻击资本家而被疏远。更好的假设可能是成员们变得越来越无聊，而好莱坞和广播电台上演了更好的节目。我不确定大多数人是否要求宗教教条的确定性。他们显然在过去做过，但过去的背景总是与现在不同。我怀疑这一段话的真实写法是因为我希望教会的人们与我一起努力摆脱贫民窟、贫困和经济苦难。嗯，我为什么不这么说呢？

Monopoly, we now know, is impossible, for the reason that a monopoly based on anything but service is self-destructive. It throws away its customers as it goes along. That has been demonstrated time and again. Centralization may degenerate into monopoly, but proper centralization means higher service.
我们现在知道，垄断是不可能的，因为基于服务以外的任何东西的垄断都是自我毁灭的。随着它的发展，它抛弃了它的客户。这已经被一次又一次地证明了。集中可能会退化为垄断，但适当的集中意味着更高的服务。
Now let’s see:

Monopoly is impossible.
垄断是不可能的。
But if it is based on service it isn’t impossible.

Improper centralization may degenerate into monopoly.
不适当的集中化可能会退化为垄断。
But monopoly is impossible.

Runarounds such as this arise because referents have not been found for “monopoly,” “service,” or “centralization.” If we duck under the words to look at such monopolies as the United States Post Office, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the United Shoe Machinery Corporation, the Aluminum Company of America, we quickly realize that Henry Ford is talking with his eyes shut and telling us nothing worth listening to.

Labour, therefore, it appears evidently, is the only universal as well as the only accurate measure of value, or the only standard by which we can compare the values of different commodities at all times, and at all places.
因此，显然，劳动是唯一普遍且唯一准确的价值衡量标准，或者是我们可以在任何时候、任何地点比较不同商品价值的唯一标准。
Here is the father of laissez faire hot on the scent of a Universal—something valid at all times and all places. He finds “labour” to be the accurate measure by which the “values” of different commodities can be compared. And what, Mr. Smith, are the referents for “labour,” and how shall they be measured? Man-hours, foot-pounds, average skill, what? We already know that ‘labour” is a hazy abstraction, not susceptible to quantitative appraisal. The above is an excellent example of economic writing—a statement which seems clear, authoritative, even scientific, and turns out to be a mouthful of mush.
这位自由放任主义之父热衷于普遍性的气味——这种东西在任何时候、任何地方都有效。他发现“劳动”是比较不同商品“价值”的准确衡量标准。史密斯先生，“劳动”的指称是什么？如何衡量它们？工时、英尺磅、平均技能，什么？我们已经知道，“劳动”是一个模糊的抽象概念，无法进行定量评估。以上是经济学写作的一个很好的例子——看似清晰、权威、甚至科学的陈述，结果却是一堆糊涂话。

Now, if the value of a commodity be determined by the amount of labour expended during its production, it might seem at first glance as if the value would be greater in proportion as the worker who made it was lazier or more unskilled. . . . But the labour which creates the substance of value is homogeneous human labour, the expenditure of uniform labour power. The total labour power of society, as embodied in the gross value of all commodities, though comprising numberless individual units of labour power, counts as an undifferentiated mass of human labour power. Each of these individual units of labour power is the same human labour power as all the other units—in so far as it has the characteristics of social average labour power, and functions as such; in so far, that is to say, as in the production of a commodity it uses only the average labour time or the socially necessary labour time. Socially necessary labour time is the labour time requisite for producing a use-value under the extant social and average conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour.
现在，如果一种商品的价值是由其生产过程中所消耗的劳动量决定的，乍一看，似乎制造该商品的工人越懒惰或越不熟练，该商品的价值就越大。 。 。 。但创造价值实质的劳动是同质的人类劳动，是同质劳动力的支出。体现在所有商品总价值中的社会总劳动力，虽然由无数个个体劳动力组成，但也算作无差别的人类劳动力总量。这些单独的劳动力单位与所有其他单位一样，都是人类劳动力——只要它具有社会平均劳动力的特征，并具有社会平均劳动力的功能；也就是说，到目前为止，在商品的生产中，它只使用了平均劳动时间或社会必要劳动时间。社会必要劳动时间是指在现有社会平均生产条件下，在平均技能程度和劳动强度下，生产使用价值所必需的劳动时间。
Marx improves on Adam Smith by offering a time unit—say a man-hour—as the measure of “labour” which determines the “value” of a commodity. But in shying away from the lazy worker’s man-hour as an index of high value, he gets himself first into a metaphysical concept of “homogeneous uniform average labour power,” and second into an even muzzier concept of “socially necessary labour time.” Man-hours can be measured but, as Marx wisely admits, they are useless in the premises. The “expenditure of uniform labour power” and “socially necessary labour time” are concepts beyond the operational approach. Thus they can give us no light on the “substance of value”—whatever, in turn, that may be. Marx’s concept of the “value” of a commodity sometimes was and sometimes was not its money price. Price we know to be a shifting concept, but at least you can pin a number to it at a given time and place. “Value” as something above and beyond price is a mystical notion. Economics is rotten with such notions. When will economists give up their forlorn attempts to measure the incommensurable?
马克思在亚当·斯密的基础上进行了改进，提出了一个时间单位——比如工时——作为决定商品“价值”的“劳动”的衡量标准。但由于回避将懒惰工人的工时作为高价值指标，他首先陷入了“同质统一平均劳动力”的形而上学概念，其次陷入了“社会必要劳动时间”的更加模糊的概念。工时是可以衡量的，但正如马克思明智地承认的那样，工时在前提下毫无用处。 “统一劳动力支出”和“社会必要劳动时间”是超出操作方法的概念。因此，它们无法让我们了解“价值的实质”——无论它是什么。马克思关于商品“价值”的概念有时是、有时不是其货币价格。我们知道价格是一个不断变化的概念，但至少你可以在给定的时间和地点给它固定一个数字。超越价格的“价值”是一个神秘的概念。经济学因这种观念而腐烂。经济学家什么时候才会放弃衡量不可通约事物的绝望尝试？

I believe that the political innovations of recent times signify nothing less than the political domination of the masses. The old democracy was tempered by a generous dose of liberalism and of enthusiasm for law. By serving these principles, the individual bound himself to maintain a severe discipline over himself. Under the shelter of liberal principles and the rule of law, minorities could live and act. Democracy and law—life in common under the law—were synonymous. Today we are witnessing the triumphs of a hyperdemocracy in which the mass acts directly, outside the law, imposing its aspirations and its desires by means of material pressure.
我认为，近代的政治创新无非就是群众的政治统治。旧的民主制度受到大量自由主义和对法律的热情的调和。通过遵循这些原则，个人约束自己对自己保持严格的纪律。在自由主义原则和法治的庇护下，少数群体可以生活和行动。民主和法律——法律下的共同生活——是同义词。今天，我们正在目睹超级民主的胜利，其中群众在法律之外直接行动，通过物质压力强加其愿望和愿望。
What a parade: “masses,” “old democracy,” “dose of liberalism,” “enthusiasm for law,” “liberal principles,” “rule of law,” “hyperdemocracy,” “material pressure.” The chief meaning that I can wring out of this is that Señor Gasset doesn’t like poor people.

Those nations that prize personal liberty as their most valuable possession must today recognize the end of it must be and always will be the most agonizing form of dictatorship, a dictatorship of the masses. . . . These will pay for this liberty with their own existence. They will come under the dictatorship of the Jewish race. . . . Those democrats who come here and shake their heads because we march so much need to be told something: They will reap from their democratic idea of liberty the destruction of their liberty. At the end of their road lies not order but chaos. . . . This word “freedom” is particularly a problem for us here at this time. It is used in the sense of academic freedom, liberty for the academic citizen and the student, and freedom for the university and for science. Believe me, my young comrades, behind the word “freedom” demons lurk. We have the most tragic example in the history of Athens. . . . Pericles asserted that the Athenians, although they enjoyed personal liberty, had shown themselves on the battlefield to be equals of the Spartans. Yet at the end of that war Athens was defeated and on the road to ruin.
那些视个人自由为最宝贵财产的国家今天必须认识到，它的终结必定是而且永远是最痛苦的独裁形式，即群众的独裁。 。 。 。他们将以自己的存在为这种自由付出代价。他们将受到犹太种族的独裁统治。 。 。 。那些来到这里因为我们游行太多而摇头的民主党人需要被告知一些事情：他们将从民主的自由理念中收获对自由的破坏。他们道路的尽头不是秩序，而是混乱。 。 。 。 “自由”这个词此时对我们来说尤其是一个问题。它的含义是学术自由、学术公民和学生的自由以及大学和科学的自由。年轻的同志们，相信我，“自由”这个词的背后潜伏着恶魔。我们有雅典历史上最悲惨的例子。 。 。 。伯里克利断言，雅典人虽然享有个人自由，但在战场上表现得与斯巴达人平等。然而，在那次战争结束时，雅典战败并走上了毁灭之路。
Observe the use by Dr. Rust of the time-honored technique of “the lessons of history.” Sparta 400 B.C. = Germany 1937 A.D. A is A. It personal liberty is allowed, nations lose wars. Observe the twistings and turnings around the concept of liberty. Observe the wild extrapolation that the democratic idea of liberty means the destruction of liberty—with the Jews as dictators. But Dr. Rust inadvertently makes one cogent remark: “Behind the word ‘freedom’ demons lurk.”

Democracy is not committed by its solicitude for individuality to any dogma about who shall own how much property. It is not the Marxist dogma against private property, but Communism’s drive against private beliefs that renders impossible any genuinely united front. Fascism is a nervous pursuit of power in which might makes right and the will to perfection is lustily appropriated as an adjunct of collective action. Communism is a pursuit of perfection so hasty and hot as to squeeze to death the very perfection clutched in the arms of loving power. Democratic freedom means the general agreement to stay out of each other’s light by respecting privacy for the sake of perfection and to humanize power by compounding that of each into the mutual catharsis furnished by compromise of interests. Here is the only social pathway to individuality.
民主并不因为对个性的关注而屈服于任何关于谁应拥有多少财产的教条。并不是马克思主义教条反对私有财产，而是共产主义反对私人信仰，这使得任何真正的统一战线变得不可能。法西斯主义是对权力的神经质追求，强权即正义，追求完美的意志被强烈地用作集体行动的附属品。共产主义是一种对完美的追求，如此仓促而激烈，以致于将爱的力量手中紧握的完美捏死。民主自由意味着人们普遍同意通过为了完美而尊重隐私来避开彼此的光芒，并通过将每个人的权力混合到利益妥协所提供的相互宣泄中来使权力人性化。这是实现个性的唯一社会途径。

I am prepared to concede that free collectivism is as incompatible with political democracy in its present manifestations as are the planned economy of communism or the corporate State of fascism. Democracy which responds sensitively to prevailing opinion with that opinion articulated in pressure groups is incapable of operating any government successfully in war or peace. . . .
我准备承认，自由集体主义与目前表现形式的政治民主是不相容的，就像共产主义的计划经济或法西斯主义的企业国家一样。对压力团体中表达的主流观点做出敏感反应的民主，无法在战争或和平时期成功运作任何政府。 。 。 。
Absolute democracy is as a matter of fact the political reflection of economic laissez faire. . . .

Free collectivism is the ideal of the free man secure as against all the principalities and powers of the world. Its permanent concern is for those who are, as Aristotle described them, in the middle condition. . . .
自由集体主义是自由人的理想，可以对抗世界上所有的君主和强权。正如亚里士多德所描述的那样，它永远关注那些处于中间状态的人。 。 。 。
When I suggest that absolute collectivism means decisions centralized in the state, I do not mean that every decision is centralized in the state. When I suggest that a free collectivism would compensate rather than command, redress the balance of private enterprises rather than administer them, I do not mean that it will not be found issuing commands and vetoes or administering many enterprises. I mean that the main prejudice, the predominant character, in the one is official decision and in the other private judgment.
当我提出绝对集体主义意味着决策集中于国家时，我并不是说每项决策都集中于国家。当我提出自由集体主义应该补偿而不是命令，纠正私营企业的平衡而不是管理它们时，我并不是说它不会发出命令和否决或管理许多企业。我的意思是，主要偏见、主要特征，一方面是官方决定，另一方面是私人判断。
Well, what do you mean, Mr. Lippmann? And did you ever see anyone render an official decision which was not a private judgment? The state no more speaks through the official than “the law” speaks through the judge. Always Adam1 has to exercise his cortex—his own, private cortex—and open his mouth and utter what he decides. Mr. Lippmann apparently wants “freedom” but sees “collectivism” as inevitable, so he coins a new term, “compensated collectivism,” and objectifies it as a house where both spooks can live amicably together.
那么，李普曼先生，您是什么意思？您是否见过有人做出非私人判断的官方决定？国家不再通过官员说话，正如“法律”不再通过法官说话一样。亚当1总是必须锻炼他的大脑皮层——他自己的、私人的大脑皮层——张开嘴说出他的决定。李普曼先生显然想要“自由”，但认为“集体主义”是不可避免的，因此他创造了一个新术语“补偿性集体主义”，并将其具体化为两个幽灵可以友好相处的房子。

If the minions of the C.I.O. attempt to carry through the South their lawless plan of organization, if they attempt to demoralize our industry, to corrupt our colored citizens, to incite race hatreds and race warfare, I warn him here and now that they will be met by the flower of Southern manhood and they will reap the bitter fruits of their folly.
我警告约翰·L·刘易斯和他的共产主义同伙，不会容忍打着苏维埃俄罗斯的红色旗帜、打着首席信息官的口号对南方进行第二次探险。如果首席信息官的爪牙试图在南方推行他们无法无天的组织计划，如果他们试图瓦解我们的工业士气，腐蚀我们的有色公民，煽动种族仇恨和种族战争，我现在就警告他，他们将被遇到南方男子气概之花时，他们将收获自己愚蠢的苦果。
The honorable gentleman from Georgia gives us a rendering of Southern oratory with all stops out. In one sense it is meaningless balderdash. Yet in another it is pregnant with tragic meaning. Mr. Cox is calling on all the old gods of the South with his war cries of “carpet bag,” “race warfare,” “flower of Southern manhood,” to crush labor unions. John L. Lewis is identified with both Moscow and the hated Yankee carpetbaggers of post-Civil War days. There is more than a hint of the flaming cross of a new Ku Klux Klan that will take law enforcement into its own hands.
这位来自佐治亚州的尊敬的先生为我们呈现了南方演讲的精彩表现。从某种意义上说，这是毫无意义的胡言乱语。但在另一方面，它又蕴含着悲剧意义。考克斯先生用“地毯袋”、“种族战争”、“南方男子气概之花”的战争口号呼吁南方所有的旧神镇压工会。约翰·L·刘易斯 (John L. Lewis) 被认为是莫斯科和内战后令人憎恶的北方佬的代表。这不仅仅是一个新三K党的燃烧十字架的暗示，它将把执法部门掌握在自己手中。
It appears extremely probable that sooner or later industries in the South as well as in the North will have to accept the institution of collective bargaining. But Mr. Cox and his friends, by such talk as this, are apparently doing their best to postpone the development, with a maximum of hatred, violence, and bloodshed in the interim. Words such as these make things so much harder than they need to be, hurt so many more people than need to be hurt, stir up so much needless bad blood. A warning to the C.I.O. to use lawful methods in organizing Southern workers would be timely and helpful. Mr. Cox is not issuing a warning. Under a bloody shirt of words, he is delivering an ultimatum that the South will risk another Civil War to defeat collective bargaining.
南方和北方的工业迟早很可能必须接受集体谈判制度。但考克斯先生和他的朋友们通过这样的言论，显然正在尽最大努力推迟事态的发展，并在此期间进行最大限度的仇恨、暴力和流血。诸如此类的话语让事情变得比原本需要的更加困难，伤害了比需要伤害的更多的人，激起了那么多不必要的仇恨。警告首席信息官使用合法方法组织南方工人将是及时且有益的。考克斯先生并没有发出警告。在血腥的言辞之下，他发出了最后通牒，即南方将冒着另一场内战的风险来挫败集体谈判。

Leo Stein reduces the work of art to a mere rationally cognitive object, with self as a static co-ordinate of cognition, and the entire process of the dynamic osmosis between self and self, which is the history of culture, is put away.
列奥·斯坦因将艺术作品还原为纯粹的理性认知对象，以自我作为认知的静态坐标，自我与自我之间动态渗透的整个过程，即文化的历史，被收了起来。
As one passes from one pearl to another on Mr. Frank’s string, one finds John Dewey being called an “antiphilosopher.” Seriously, some mathematician should take Mr. Frank into a corner and read him a lecture. Terms like “integer” and “co-ordinate” should not be stolen out of the laboratory and thus debased. There are plenty of perfectly respectable philosophical words to run through a diapason, or over a dynamic osmosis.
当人们在弗兰克先生的绳子上从一颗珍珠传到另一颗珍珠时，人们会发现约翰·杜威被称为“反哲学家”。说真的，一些数学家应该把弗兰克先生带到一个角落里，给他读一堂课。像“整数”和“坐标”这样的术语不应该被偷出实验室并因此被贬低。有很多完全值得尊敬的哲学词汇贯穿于整个音域，或者贯穿于动态的渗透之中。

Thought being possible only under relation, the relative reality can be conceived as such only in connection with an absolute reality; and the connection between the two, being absolutely persistent in our consciousness, is real in the same sense as the terms it unites are real. . . . Such being our cognition of the relative reality, what are we to say of the absolute reality? We can only say that it is some mode of the Unknowable, related to the matter we know as cause to effect.
思想只有在关系下才可能存在，相对现实只有在与绝对现实相联系时才能被设想为这样。两者之间的联系在我们的意识中绝对持久，是真实的，就像它所联合的术语是真实的一样。 。 。 。这就是我们对相对现实的认识，那么我们对绝对现实又该如何说呢？我们只能说它是某种不可知的模式，与我们所知的因果关系有关。

This then is the final triumph of thought—that it disintegrates all societies, and at last destroys the thinker himself. Perhaps the invention of thought was one of the cardinal errors of mankind. For thought first undermined morality by shearing it of its supernatural sanctions and sanctity.
这就是思想的最终胜利——它瓦解了所有社会，并最终摧毁了思想家本人。也许思想的发明是人类的重大错误之一。因为思想首先通过切断道德的超自然制裁和神圣性来破坏道德。
A good working exhibit of philosophy at its worst. Dr. Durant seems to hold that some unknown Edison invented the cortex and that it was an unwise thing to do. If Dr. Durant had said that bad language has the possibility of disintegrating some societies, he might have told us something.

Now it is obviously critical flippancy to fob off D. H. Lawrence as another example of Romanticism gone to seed. On the contrary, any critical analysis of Romanticism must necessarily assimilate the crucial experience of Lawrence. He uprooted violently those two inevitable growths of the Romantic ideal of Love: the Platonic idealism of a Shelley and the equally dehumanized Platonic Satanism of a Baudelaire. Lawrence attempted to bind and cathect emotional experience to the living fabric of flesh and blood. In this mighty effort to mutate the Romantic Ideal, he encountered that harrowing spiritual dilemma which he never solved: the necessity to accept not only the beauty of the freely passional life but also the cruelty and sadism that seemed an inevitable part of its instinctive give and take.
现在，将 DH 劳伦斯视为浪漫主义已萌芽的又一个例子，显然是一种轻率的批评。相反，任何对浪漫主义的批判性分析都必须吸收劳伦斯的重要经验。他猛烈地连根拔起浪漫主义爱情理想的两种不可避免的发展：雪莱的柏拉图式理想主义和波德莱尔式的同样非人性的柏拉图式撒旦主义。劳伦斯试图将情感体验与有血有肉的生命结构结合起来并吸引起来。在改变浪漫主义理想的巨大努力中，他遇到了他从未解决过的令人痛苦的精神困境：不仅需要接受自由激情生活的美丽，而且还需要接受残酷和施虐，这似乎是其本能给予和施虐的不可避免的一部分。拿。
I get one or two gleams of sense out of this and perhaps the reader gets more. I quote it as run-of-the-mine literary criticism. It is clearer than some samples, but obviously no ball of fire. Literary criticism appears to be a kind of game that intellectuals play with each other by mail. They become much angrier than chess-players do, but they have a lot of fun too. The trouble is they often take themselves seriously, forget their game, and begin to instruct you and me in Platonic Satanism and mutations of the Romantic Ideal.
我从中领悟到一两点道理，也许读者会得到更多。我将其作为最常见的文学批评来引用。比一些样品更清晰，但明显没有火球。文学批评似乎是知识分子通过邮件相互玩的一种游戏。他们变得比国际象棋棋手更生气，但他们也有很多乐趣。问题是他们经常认真对待自己，忘记了他们的游戏，并开始用柏拉图式的撒旦主义和浪漫理想的突变来指导你和我。
It may be possible to formulate objective literary standards in words, but I never saw it done. Adam1 can attempt to describe how a book impresses him; that is all that the communicative mechanism to date allows. There are few objective standards he can summon to his aid. He can say, “I like this poem or this book, and so I think it is a good book.” No man alive can say, and prove, “This is a good book.” When many people over many years all feel that a book is good, it becomes a classic. Why do people fed that way? It has never been determined, but the literary critics give their lives to trying to determine it. Perhaps semantics may some day release them from the treadmill.
也许可以用文字来制定客观的文学标准，但我从未见过它被完成。 Adam1 可以尝试描述一本书如何给他留下深刻的印象；这就是迄今为止的沟通机制所允许的一切。他几乎没有什么客观标准可以用来帮助他。他可以说：“我喜欢这首诗或这本书，所以我认为这是一本好书。”没有一个活着的人能够说并证明：“这是一本好书。”当很多人多年来都觉得一本书好时，它就成为经典。为什么人们要这样吃饭？它从来没有被确定过，但文学批评家却竭尽全力试图确定它。也许有一天，语义学可以将它们从跑步机上解放出来。

Faith tells us that things are not what at first sight, or even when put to wonderful purposes, just what they seem to be. Here is the basis of all our natural science, a religious thing. It matters not at all how a non-religious person may seek to explain or explain away; the fact still remains that it is this element in religion that makes possible all our scientific advances.
信仰告诉我们，事物并不是乍一看的样子，甚至不是出于美好的目的，而是它们看起来的样子。这是我们所有自然科学的基础，一个宗教的东西。一个无宗教信仰的人如何寻求解释或辩解根本不重要；重要的是。事实仍然是，正是宗教中的这一要素使我们所有的科学进步成为可能。
This is what comes of mixing religion and science. Observe the manner in which Dean Powell tucks science in his carpet bag and leaves hastily for the higher regions. No scientists are allowed to expostulate. Smothered in faith, they must remain forever silent. We are reminded of the formal logicians who similarly sought to annex science.

Education implies teaching. Teaching implies knowledge Knowledge is truth. The truth is everywhere the same. Hence education should be everywhere the same.
教育意味着教学。教学意味着知识 知识就是真理。真理到处都是一样的。因此，教育在任何地方都应该是一样的。
It would be difficult to find a passage of equal length where so many semantic rules are broken. First, we have four high-order abstractions connected: “education,” “teaching,” “knowledge,” “truth.” Then we have absolute identity established: “knowledge is truth.” Then we have one “truth” for all places, and presumably for all times. Lastly we have formal logic applied in its worst sense: “Hence education should be everywhere the same.” On this ghostly foundation, Dr. Hutchins rears his plan for actual, functioning colleges. Presently, God help us, actual money may be forthcoming to employ actual professors to instruct actual students.
很难找到一个同样长度的段落，其中有如此多的语义规则被打破。首先，我们有四个相互关联的高阶抽象概念：“教育”、“教学”、“知识”、“真理”。然后我们就建立了绝对的同一性：“知识就是真理”。那么我们就有了一个适用于所有地方、也可能适用于所有时代的“真理”。最后，我们将形式逻辑应用到了最坏的意义上：“因此，教育应该到处都是一样的。”在这个幽灵般的基础上，哈钦斯博士提出了他的关于实际运作的大学的计划。现在，上帝保佑我们，我们可能会得到真正的钱来聘请真正的教授来指导真正的学生。

It is true that other nations may, as they do, enforce contrary rules of conscience and conduct. It is true that policies that may be pursued under flags other than our own are beyond our jurisdiction. Yet in our inner individual lives we can never be indifferent, and we assert for ourselves complete freedom to embrace, to profess, and to observe the principles for which our flag has so long been the lofty symbol.

Last year the Japanese Government took occasion to ask the Chinese to rectify their attitude toward Japan . . . and invited the Nanking Government to demonstrate its sincerity regarding the concrete questions bound up with the amelioration of relations between the two countries. Unfortunately, as you know, negotiations came to an impasse owing to Chinese recalcitrance. . . . I need not repeat here that the Japanese policy in Eastern Asia is directed solely toward the realization of stability through conciliation and co-operation between Japan, Manchukuo and China, and by stopping the Communist invasion of the Orient. The Japanese Government, therefore, earnestly hopes that China will as soon as possible come to have a full understanding and appreciation of our basic policy. However, today in China not only is such an understanding or appreciation absent but anti-Japanese sentiments have been still more intensified.
去年，日本政府借机要求中国端正对日态度。 。 。并请南京政府在与改善两国关系有关的具体问题上表现出诚意。不幸的是，如你所知，由于中国的顽抗，谈判陷入僵局。 。 。 。我无需在此重复，日本的东亚政策完全是为了通过日本、满洲国和中国之间的和解与合作以及阻止共产党对东方的入侵来实现稳定。因此，日本政府殷切希望中方尽快充分理解和赞赏我们的基本政策。然而，今天的中国不但没有这样的认识和欣赏，而且反日情绪更加高涨。
Here is a diplomat saying what he does not mean as earnestly as a vendor of subdivision swamp lots. It is a good running sample of diplomatic talk, buttered for home consumption, sugared for foreign consumption, and garnished with florid terms such as “rectify their attitude,” “amelioration of relations,” “realization of stability-,” “conciliation,” “co-operation,” “Communist invasion,” “earnestly hopes,” “basic policy.”
这是一位外交官所说的，他的意思并不像细分沼泽地的供应商那样认真。这是外交谈话的一个很好的范例，为国内消费抹上黄油，为外国消费加糖，并用诸如“纠正态度”、“改善关系”、“实现稳定”、“和解”等华丽术语装饰。 “合作”、“共产主义入侵”、“殷切希望”、“基本政策”。
Where diplomats really let themselves go, however, is in their “agreements in principle,” contrasted with their tangible performance. To agree in principle apparently means not to agree in fact.
然而，外交官真正放飞自我的地方在于他们的“原则协议”，与他们的实际表现形成鲜明对比。表面上原则上同意实际上并不同意。

My dear Sir:
我亲爱的先生：
A few years back I used to read your writings and think there was logic to them, so I am rather surprised when you turn up in the ranks of the Communists, though from a financial standpoint they, of course, are the only ones who have money to pay you right now. . . .
几年前，我曾经读过你的著作，认为它们是有逻辑的，所以当你出现在共产党人的行列中时，我感到相当惊讶，尽管从财务角度来看，他们当然是唯一拥有这些的人。现在就付钱给你。 。 。 。
It is going to be just too bad for those gentiles who make their beds with the Communists or Socialists (all one now). Anybody with half the intelligence that you seem to possess should see the handwriting on the wall and square himself around for the jolt. Scriptures tell us that all the nations of the earth shall vomit the Jew back to his native land of Palestine, there to be blessed of God. We in America do not understand why God is withholding these blessings so long, for the convulsions of our nausea are becoming most violent. Hitler vomited them over to us, and this puts double duty on our stomachs, since Madame Perkins (Jewish) has admitted all the European cattle and murderers unlawfully, who are here festering Communism. They paraded on La Salle Street Saturday. Jews in their cars wore a smile. Gentiles on the street turned pale and jittery. Naturally they shrink from Communism with those niggers on the pay roll of the Jews. . . .
对于那些与共产主义者或社会主义者（现在都是同一个）同床共枕的外邦人来说，这太糟糕了。任何拥有你一半智力的人都应该看到墙上的字迹并摆好姿势迎接震动。圣经告诉我们，地球上的所有国家都会把犹太人赶回他的祖国巴勒斯坦，在那里受到上帝的祝福。我们美国人不明白为什么上帝这么长时间不给予这些祝福，因为我们的恶心痉挛变得最猛烈。希特勒把它们吐给了我们，这给我们的胃带来了双重责任，因为珀金斯夫人（犹太人）非法接纳了所有欧洲的牛和杀人犯，他们在这里使共产主义溃烂。他们周六在拉萨尔街游行。车里的犹太人面带微笑。街上的外邦人脸色苍白，神情紧张。自然地，他们对共产主义和那些在犹太人工资单上的黑鬼感到畏缩。 。 。 。
You say you are “organizing intelligent people in channels of action” (Communistic). My program will block that.
你说你正在“在行动渠道中组织聪明人”（共产主义）。我的程序会阻止它。
Yours truly. . . .
敬上。 。 。 。
I realize that it is not good taste to reprint private letters. I do not regard this as a private letter. It is a warning to some of us who are trying to make Adam1 a little more secure by an organization outside of, and incompatible with, the communist movement, a warning that we shall be driven into the sea with communist, socialist, Jew, “nigger,” and Frances Perkins’s “cattle and murderers.” This is language at its worst. First we find a gross misinterpretation of the environment, in this case the actual situation in the United States. Then we find a fusillade of loose and violent inferences based on misinterpretation. Finally may come hideous physical violence, spawned and driven by such words as these.
我意识到转载私信的品味并不好。我不认为这是一封私人信件。这是对我们中一些人的警告，他们试图通过一个共产主义运动之外的、与共产主义运动不相容的组织来让亚当1更加安全，警告我们将与共产主义、社会主义、犹太人一起被赶入大海，“黑鬼”和弗朗西斯·珀金斯的“牛与杀人犯”。这是最糟糕的语言。首先，我们发现对环境的严重误解，在本例中是对美国实际情况的误解。然后我们发现基于误解的一系列松散和暴力的推论。最后可能会出现可怕的身体暴力，这些暴力是由此类言论引发和驱动的。

1. A good working definition of quanta is “counts made by human counters.” When we count 1, 2, 3, we are defining quanta, which consist of undivided intervals between the counting steps. In sub-microscopic regions the behavior of some things may be described in terms of the relations between whole numbers, 1, 2, 3, with no confusing fractions.
1. 量子的一个很好的工作定义是“人类计数器进行的计数”。当我们数 1、2、3 时，我们定义了量子，它由计数步骤之间不可分割的间隔组成。在亚微观区域中，某些事物的行为可以用整数 1、2、3 之间的关系来描述，而没有令人困惑的分数。
