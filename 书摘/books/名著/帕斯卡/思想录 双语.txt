The details of his life are as fully known as we can expect to know them; his mathematical and physical discoveries have been treated many times; his religious sentiment and his theological views have been discussed again and again; and his prose style has been analysed by French critics down to the finest particular. 
他的生活细节已为我们所熟知，正如我们所期望的那样。他的数学和物理发现已被多次讨论；他的宗教情感和神学观点被反复讨论；法国评论家对他的散文风格进行了最细致的分析。
But Pascal is one of those writers who will be and who must be studied afresh by men in every generation. 
但帕斯卡是每一代人将会并且必须重新研究的作家之一。
It is not he who changes, but we who change. 
改变的不是他，而是我们。
It is not our knowledge of him that increases, but our world that alters and our attitudes towards it. 
并不是我们对他的了解增加了，而是我们的世界以及我们对世界的态度发生了变化。
The history of human opinions of Pascal and of men of his stature is a part of the history of humanity. 
帕斯卡和他这种地位的人的人类观点的历史是人类历史的一部分。
That indicates his permanent importance. 
这表明了他永久的重要性。
 The facts of Pascal's life, so far as they are necessary for this brief introduction to the _Pensées_, are as follows. 
帕斯卡生平的事实，就其对《回忆录》的简要介绍而言是必要的，如下。
He was born at Clermont, in Auvergne, in 1623. 
 1623 年，他出生于奥弗涅的克莱蒙。
His family were people of substance of the upper middle class. 
他的家人都是中上层阶级的富裕人士。
His father was a government official, who was able to leave, when he died, a sufficient patrimony to his one son and his two daughters. 
他的父亲是一名政府官员，死后给他的一个儿子和两个女儿留下了足够的遗产。
In 1631 the father moved to Paris, and a few years later took up another government post at Rouen. 
 1631 年，父亲搬到巴黎，几年后在鲁昂担任另一个政府职务。
Wherever he lived, the elder Pascal seems to have mingled with some of the best society, and with men of eminence in science and the arts. 
无论老帕斯卡生活在哪里，他似乎都与一些上流社会人士以及科学和艺术领域的杰出人士交往。
Blaise was educated entirely by his father at home. 
布莱斯完全是在家里接受父亲的教育。
He was exceedingly precocious, indeed excessively precocious, for his application to studies in childhood and adolescence impaired his health, and is held responsible for his death at thirty-nine. 
他非常早熟，确实是非常早熟，因为他在童年和青少年时期的学习损害了他的健康，并被认为对他三十九岁时的死亡负有责任。
Prodigious, though not incredible stories are preserved, especially of his precocity in mathematics. 
一些令人惊奇但并不令人难以置信的故事被保留了下来，尤其是关于他在数学方面早熟的故事。
His mind was active rather than accumulative; he showed from his earliest years that disposition to find things out for himself, which has characterised the infancy of Clerk-Maxwell and other scientists. 
他的头脑是主动的，而不是积累的；他从很小的时候就表现出了自己发现问题的倾向，这也是克拉克-麦克斯韦和其他科学家的童年特征。
Of his later discoveries in physics there is no need for mention here; it must only be remembered that he counts as one of the greatest physicists and mathematicians of all time; and that his discoveries were made during the years when most scientists are still apprentices. 
关于他后来在物理学上的发现，这里无需提及；必须记住的是，他被认为是有史以来最伟大的物理学家和数学家之一；他的发现是在大多数科学家还是学徒的时候做出的。
 The elder Pascal, Étienne, was a sincere Christian. 
老帕斯卡·艾蒂安是一位虔诚的基督徒。
About 1646 he fell in with some representatives of the religious revival within the Church which has become known as Jansenism--after Jansenius, Bishop of Ypres, whose theological work is taken as the origin of the movement. 
大约 1646 年，他结识了教会内宗教复兴运动的一些代表，该复兴运动后来被称为詹森主义（Jansenism）——以伊普尔主教詹森纽斯 (Jansenius) 的名字命名，他的神学著作被认为是该运动的起源。
"This period is usually spoken of as the moment of Pascal's ""first conversion."" The word ""conversion,"" however, is too forcible to be applied at this point to Blaise Pascal himself. "
这一时期通常被称为帕斯卡“第一次皈依”的时刻。然而，“皈依”这个词此时用在布莱斯·帕斯卡本人身上太过牵强。
The family had always been devout, and the younger Pascal, though absorbed in his scientific work, never seems to have been afflicted with infidelity. 
这个家庭一直都很虔诚，而年轻的帕斯卡虽然全神贯注于他的科学工作，但似乎从未受到不忠的困扰。
"His attention was then directed, certainly, to religious and theological matters; but the term ""conversion"" can only be applied to his sisters--the elder, already Madame Périer, and particularly the younger, Jacqueline, who at that time conceived a vocation for the religious life. "
当然，他的注意力随后转向了宗教和神学问题。但“皈依”一词只能适用于他的姐妹们——姐姐，已经是佩里尔夫人，尤其是妹妹杰奎琳，她当时就立志要从事宗教生活。
Pascal himself was by no means disposed to renounce the world. 
帕斯卡本人决不打算放弃这个世界。
After the death of the father in 1650 Jacqueline, a young woman of remarkable strength and beauty of character, wished to take her vows as a sister of Port-Royal, and for some time her wish remained unfulfilled owing to the opposition of her brother. 
 1650年父亲去世后，年轻女子杰奎琳（Jacqueline）希望立誓成为皇家港口的姐妹，但由于哥哥的反对，她的愿望一度未能实现。
His objection was on the purely worldly ground that she wished to make over her patrimony to the Order; whereas while she lived with him, their combined resources made it possible for him to live more nearly on a scale of expense congenial to his tastes. 
他的反对纯粹是基于世俗的理由，即她希望将她的遗产转交给骑士团。而当她和他住在一起时，他们的综合资源使他能够以更符合他口味的开支水平生活。
He liked, in fact, not only to mix with the best society, but to keep a coach and horses--six horses is the number at one time attributed to his carriage. 
事实上，他不仅喜欢与上流社会打交道，还喜欢拥有一辆马车和马匹——他的马车一度有六匹马。
Though he had no legal power to prevent his sister from disposing of her property as she elected, the amiable Jacqueline shrank from doing so without her brother's willing approval. 
尽管他没有法律权力阻止他的妹妹按照她的选择处置她的财产，但和蔼可亲的杰奎琳在未经她哥哥同意的情况下不敢这样做。
The Mother Superior, Mère Angélique--herself an eminent personage in the history of this religious movement--finally persuaded the young novice to enter the order without the satisfaction of bringing her patrimony with her; but Jacqueline remained so distressed by this situation that her brother finally relented. 
院长安吉利克夫人——她本人就是这场宗教运动历史上的杰出人物——最终说服这位年轻的新手加入了修道会，但并没有带着她的遗产来满足。但杰奎琳对这种情况仍然感到非常痛苦，以至于她的哥哥终于让步了。
" So far as is known, the worldly life enjoyed by Pascal during this period can hardly be qualified as ""dissipation,"" and certainly not as ""debauchery."" Even gambling may have appealed to him chiefly as affording a study of mathematical probabilities. "
就目前所知，帕斯卡这一时期所享受的世俗生活很难被称为“放荡”，更不能被称为“放荡”。甚至赌博对他的吸引力也可能主要是因为它提供了对数学概率的研究。
He appears to have led such a life as any cultivated intellectual man of good position and independent means might lead and consider himself a model of probity and virtue. 
他的生活似乎与任何有教养、有良好地位和独立经济能力的知识分子一样，并认为自己是正直和美德的典范。
Not even a love-affair is laid at his door, though he is said to have contemplated marriage. 
尽管据说他曾考虑过结婚，但他甚至没有谈过恋爱。
But Jansenism, as represented by the religious society of Port-Royal, was morally a Puritan movement within the Church, and its standards of conduct were at least as severe as those of any Puritanism in England or America. 
但以皇家港宗教协会为代表的詹森主义在道德上是教会内部的清教徒运动，其行为标准至少与英国或美国的任何清教主义一样严格。
The period of fashionable society, in Pascal's life, is however, of great importance in his development. 
然而，在帕斯卡的一生中，时尚社会时期对他的发展至关重要。
It enlarged his knowledge of men and refined his tastes; he became a man of the world and never lost what he had learnt; and when he turned his thoughts wholly towards religion, his worldly knowledge was a part of his composition which is essential to the value of his work. 
它扩大了他对人的认识，提高了他的品味。他成为了一个见多识广的人，并且从未忘记他所学到的东西。当他的思想完全转向宗教时，他的世俗知识就成为他作品的一部分，这对他的作品的价值至关重要。
 Pascal's interest in society did not distract him from scientific research; nor did this period occupy much space in what is a very short and crowded life. 
帕斯卡对社会的兴趣并没有分散他对科学研究的注意力。在他短暂而拥挤的一生中，这段时期也没有占据太多空间。
Partly his natural dissatisfaction with such a life, once he had learned all it had to teach him, partly the influence of his saintly sister Jacqueline, partly increasing suffering as his health declined, directed him more and more out of the world and to thoughts of eternity. 
一旦他学会了生活所教给他的一切，他对这种生活的自然不满，部分是他圣洁的妹妹杰奎琳的影响，部分是随着他的健康状况恶化而增加的痛苦，引导他越来越远离这个世界，转向对世界的思考。永恒。
"And in 1654 occurs what is called his ""second conversion,"" but which might be called his conversion simply. "
 1654 年发生了所谓的“第二次皈依”，但这也可以简单地称为他的皈依。
 He made a note of his mystical experience, which he kept always about him, and which was found, after his death, sewn into the coat which he was wearing. 
他记下了自己的神秘经历，并将其随身携带，并在他死后被发现，缝在他穿的外套上。
The experience occurred on 23 November, 1654, and there is no reason to doubt its genuineness unless we choose to deny all mystical experience. 
这次经历发生在 1654 年 11 月 23 日，没有理由怀疑它的真实性，除非我们选择否认所有神秘的经历。
Now, Pascal was not a mystic, and his works are not to be classified amongst mystical writings; but what can only be called mystical experience happens to many men who do not become mystics. 
现在，帕斯卡并不是一个神秘主义者，他的作品也不应该被归类为神秘主义著作。但只能称为神秘的经历发生在许多没有成为神秘主义者的人身上。
The work which he undertook soon after, the _Lettres écrites à un provincial_, is a masterpiece of religious controversy at the opposite pole from mysticism. 
他不久之后创作的著作《乡土信件》是与神秘主义对立的宗教争论的杰作。
We know quite well that he was at the time when he received his illumination from God in extremely poor health; but it is a commonplace that some forms of illness are extremely favourable, not only to religious illumination, but to artistic and literary composition. 
我们很清楚，他接受神的光照时，身体状况极差。但众所周知，某些疾病不仅有利于宗教启迪，而且有利于艺术和文学创作。
A piece of writing meditated, apparently without progress, for months or years, may suddenly take shape and word; and in this state long passages may be produced which require little or no retouch. 
一篇文章经过数月或数年的沉思，表面上毫无进展，可能会突然成形并文字化；在这种状态下，可以产生不需要修饰或很少修饰的长段落。
I have no good word to say for the cultivation of automatic writing as the model of literary composition; I doubt whether these moments _can_ be cultivated by the writer; but he to whom this happens assuredly has the sensation of being a vehicle rather than a maker. 
对于自动写作作为文学创作模式的培养，我没有什么好话可说；我怀疑这些时刻是否可以被作家所培养；但发生这种情况的人肯定会感觉自己是一个工具，而不是一个制造者。
No masterpiece can be produced whole by such means; but neither does even the higher form of religious inspiration suffice for the religious life; even the most exalted mystic must return to the world, and use his reason to employ the results of his experience in daily life. 
任何杰作都无法通过这种方式创作出来。但即使是更高形式的宗教灵感也不足以满足宗教生活。即使是最崇高的神秘主义者也必须回到这个世界，并用他的理性将他的经验结果运用到日常生活中。
You may call it communion with the Divine, or you may call it a temporary crystallisation of the mind. 
你可以称之为与神圣的交流，或者你可以称之为心灵的暂时结晶。
Until science can teach us to reproduce such phenomena at will, science cannot claim to have explained them; and they can be judged only by their fruits. 
在科学能够教我们随意重现这些现象之前，科学不能声称已经解释了它们；只能根据他们的成果来判断他们。
 From that time until his death, Pascal was closely associated with the society of Port-Royal which his sister Jacqueline, who predeceased him, had joined as a _religieuse_; the society was then fighting for its life against the Jesuits. 
从那时起直到他去世，帕斯卡与皇家港口协会有着密切的联系，他的姐姐杰奎琳（在他之前去世）作为一名宗教信徒加入了该协会。当时该协会正在与耶稣会士为生存而战。
Five propositions, judged by a committee of cardinals and theologians at Rome to be heretical, were found to be put forward in the work of Jansenius; and the society of Port-Royal, the representative of Jansenism among devotional communities, suffered a blow from which it never revived. 
詹森纽斯的著作中提出了五项被罗马红衣主教和神学家委员会判定为异端的主张；虔诚团体中詹森主义的代表——皇家港口协会也遭受了打击，从此再也没有恢复过。
It is not the place here to review the bitter controversy and conflict; the best account, from the point of view of a critic of genius who took no side, who was neither Jansenist nor Jesuit, Christian nor infidel, is that in the great book of Sainte-Beuve, _Port-Royal_. 
这里不是回顾激烈争论和冲突的地方；而是在这里。从一位不偏袒任何一方、既不是詹森派也不是耶稣会士、基督徒也不是异教徒的天才批评家的角度来看，最好的描述是圣伯夫的伟大著作《皇家港口》中的描述。
And in this book the parts devoted to Pascal himself are among the most brilliant pages of criticism that Sainte-Beuve ever wrote. 
在这本书中，专门针对帕斯卡本人的部分是圣伯夫所写的最精彩的批评篇章之一。
"It is sufficient to notice that the next occupation of Pascal, after his conversion, was to write these eighteen ""Letters,"" which as prose are of capital importance in the foundation of French classical style, and which as polemic are surpassed by none, not by Demosthenes, or Cicero, or Swift. "
值得注意的是，帕斯卡皈依基督教后的下一个任务是写这十八封“书信”，作为散文，它们对于法国古典风格的基础至关重要，而作为论战，无人能超越。德摩斯梯尼、西塞罗或斯威夫特。
They have the limitation of all polemic and forensic: they persuade, they seduce, they are unfair. 
他们有所有争论和法证的局限性：他们说服，他们引诱，他们不公平。
But it is also unfair to assert that, in these _Letters to a Provincial_, Pascal was attacking the Society of Jesus in itself. 
但断言帕斯卡在这些《致外省人的信》中攻击耶稣会本身也是不公平的。
He was attacking rather a particular school of casuistry which relaxed the requirements of the Confessional; a school which certainly flourished amongst the Society of Jesus at that time, and of which the Spaniards Escobar and Molina are the most eminent authorities. 
他实际上是在攻击一种特殊的诡辩学派，这种学派放松了忏悔的要求。这所学校在当时的耶稣会中无疑很繁荣，西班牙人埃斯科瓦尔和莫利纳是其中最杰出的权威。
He undoubtedly abused the art of quotation, as a polemical writer can hardly help but do; but there were abuses for him to abuse; and he did the job thoroughly. 
毫无疑问，他滥用了引用的艺术，就像一个好辩的作家难免会做的那样。但也有他可以滥用的地方；他彻底地完成了这项工作。
His _Letters_ must not be called theology. 
他的书信不能被称为神学。
Academic theology was not a department in which Pascal was versed; when necessary, the fathers of Port-Royal came to his aid. 
学术神学并不是帕斯卡所精通的一个学科。必要时，皇家港的先祖们会向他提供帮助。
The _Letters_ are the work of one of the finest mathematical minds of any time, and of a man of the world who addressed, not theologians, but the world in general--all of the cultivated and many of the less cultivated of the French laity; and with this public they made an astonishing success. 
这些信件是有史以来最优秀的数学家之一的著作，也是一位世界名人的著作，他的对象不是神学家，而是整个世界——所有有教养的和许多不太有教养的法国俗人。 ;他们在公众面前取得了惊人的成功。
 During this time Pascal never wholly abandoned his scientific interests. 
在此期间，帕斯卡从未完全放弃他的科学兴趣。
Though in his religious writings he composed slowly and painfully, and revised often, in matters of mathematics his mind seemed to move with consummate natural ease and grace. 
尽管他在宗教著作中写作缓慢而痛苦，并且经常修改，但在数学方面，他的思维似乎以完美的自然轻松和优雅的方式运转。
Discoveries and inventions sprang from his brain without effort; among the minor devices of this later period, the first omnibus service in Paris is said to owe its origin to his inventiveness. 
发现和发明毫不费力地从他的大脑中涌现出来。在后来的一些小发明中，巴黎的第一个综合巴士服务据说起源于他的发明。
But rapidly failing health, and absorption in the great work he had in mind, left him little time and energy during the last two years of his life. 
但健康状况的迅速恶化，以及对他心目中的伟大工作的专注，使他在生命的最后两年里几乎没有时间和精力。
 The plan of what we call the _Pensées_ formed itself about 1660. 
我们所谓的《Pensées》的计划于 1660 年左右形成。
The completed book was to have been a carefully constructed defence of Christianity, a true Apology and a kind of Grammar of Assent, setting forth the reasons which will convince the intellect. 
完成的书是对基督教的精心构建的辩护，是真正的辩护和同意的语法，提出了足以说服智者的理由。
As I have indicated before, Pascal was not a theologian, and on dogmatic theology had recourse to his spiritual advisers. 
正如我之前指出的，帕斯卡不是神学家，在教条神学上求助于他的精神顾问。
Nor was he indeed a systematic philosopher. 
他也确实不是一位系统哲学家。
He was a man with an immense genius for science, and at the same time a natural psychologist and moralist. 
他是一位具有巨大科学天赋的人，同时也是一位天生的心理学家和道德家。
As he was a great literary artist, his book would have been also his own spiritual autobiography; his style, free from all diminishing idiosyncrasies, was yet very personal. 
由于他是一位伟大的文学艺术家，他的书也可以说是他自己的精神自传；他的风格没有任何逐渐减弱的特质，但却非常个人化。
Above all, he was a man of strong passions; and his intellectual passion for truth was reinforced by his passionate dissatisfaction with human life unless a spiritual explanation could be found. 
最重要的是，他是一个充满激情的人。除非能找到精神上的解释，否则他对人类生活的强烈不满增强了他对真理的理智热情。
 We must regard the _Pensées_ as merely the first notes for a work which he left far from completion; we have, in Sainte-Beuve's words, a tower of which the stones have been laid on each other, but not cemented, and the structure unfinished. 
我们必须将《回忆录》视为他尚未完成的一部作品的第一个注释。用圣伯夫的话说，我们有一座塔楼，塔楼的石头是相互叠放的，但没有用水泥粘合，结构还没有完工。
In early years his memory had been amazingly retentive of anything that he wished to remember; and had it not been impaired by increasing illness and pain, he probably would not have been obliged to set down these notes at all. 
早年，他对任何他想记住的事情都保持着惊人的记忆力。如果不是因为疾病和痛苦的增加而受到损害，他可能根本就没有义务写下这些笔记。
But taking the book as it is left to us, we still find that it occupies a unique place in the history of French literature and in the history of religious meditation. 
但从这本书留给我们的来看，我们仍然发现它在法国文学史上和宗教冥想史上占有独特的地位。
 To understand the method which Pascal employs, the reader must be prepared to follow the process of the mind of the intelligent believer. 
为了理解帕斯卡所采用的方法，读者必须准备好跟随聪明信徒的思维过程。
The Christian thinker--and I mean the man who is trying consciously and conscientiously to explain to himself the sequence which culminated in faith, rather than the public apologist--proceeds by rejection and elimination. 
基督教思想家——我的意思是那些有意识地、认真地试图向自己解释最终达到信仰的顺序的人，而不是公开的辩护者——通过拒绝和消除来进行。
"He finds the world to be so and so; he finds its character inexplicable by any non-religious theory; among religions he finds Christianity, and Catholic Christianity, to account most satisfactorily for the world and especially for the moral world within; and thus, by what Newman calls ""powerful and concurrent"" reasons, he finds himself inexorably committed to the dogma of the Incarnation. "
他发现世界如此如此；他发现任何非宗教理论都无法解释其特征；在各种宗教中，他发现基督教和天主教基督教对世界，特别是对内在的道德世界的解释最为令人满意。因此，由于纽曼所说的“强大而同时”的原因，他发现自己无情地致力于道成肉身的教条。
"To the unbeliever, this method seems disingenuous and perverse; for the unbeliever is, as a rule, not so greatly troubled to explain the world to himself, nor so greatly distressed by its disorder; nor is he generally concerned (in modern terms) to ""preserve values."" He does not consider that if certain emotional states, certain developments of character, and what in the highest sense can be called ""saintliness"" are inherently and by inspection known to be good, then the satisfactory explanation of the world must be an explanation which will admit the ""reality"" of these values. "
对于非信徒来说，这种方法似乎不诚实且不正当。因为一般来说，不信者不会因为向自己解释这个世界而感到那么大的困扰，也不会因为世界的混乱而感到那么大的痛苦。他一般也不关心（用现代术语来说）“维护价值观”。他并不认为，如果某些情绪状态、某些性格发展以及最高意义上的“圣人”本质上是好的，并且经检验可知是好的，那么对世界的令人满意的解释必定是这样一种解释：承认这些价值观的“现实”。
Nor does he consider such reasoning admissible; he would, so to speak, trim his values according to his cloth, because to him such values are of no great value. 
他也不认为这种推理可以接受；可以说，他会根据自己的衣着来调整自己的价值观，因为这些价值观对他来说没有多大价值。
The unbeliever starts from the other end, and as likely as not with the question: Is a case of human parthenogenesis credible? and this he would call going straight to the heart of the matter. 
不信者从另一端开始，很可能会提出这样的问题：人类单性生殖的案例可信吗？他将这称为直击问题的核心。
Now Pascal's method is, on the whole, the method natural and right for the Christian; and the opposite method is that taken by Voltaire. 
总的来说，帕斯卡的方法对于基督徒来说是自然而正确的。伏尔泰则采取相反的方法。
It is worth while to remember that Voltaire, in his attempt to refute Pascal, has given once and for all the type of such refutation; and that later opponents of Pascal's Apology for the Christian Faith have contributed little beyond psychological irrelevancies. 
值得记住的是，伏尔泰在试图反驳帕斯卡时，已经一劳永逸地给出了这种反驳的类型。后来帕斯卡《基督教信仰申辩》的反对者除了心理上的无关紧要之外，几乎没有做出什么贡献。
For Voltaire has presented, better than any one since, what is the unbelieving point of view; and in the end we must all choose for ourselves between one point of view and another. 
因为伏尔泰比此后任何人都更好地阐述了什么是不可信的观点；最终我们都必须在一种观点和另一种观点之间做出选择。
" I have said above that Pascal's method is ""on the whole"" that of the typical Christian apologist; and this reservation was directed at Pascal's belief in miracles, which plays a larger part in his construction than it would in that, at least, of the modern liberal Catholic. "
我在上面已经说过，帕斯卡的方法“总体上”是典型的基督教护教者的方法。这种保留是针对帕斯卡对奇迹的信仰，这种信仰在他的建构中所起的作用至少比在现代自由天主教徒中所起的作用更大。
It would seem fantastic to accept Christianity because we first believe the Gospel miracles to be true, and it would seem impious to accept it primarily because we believe more recent miracles to be true; we accept the miracles, or some miracles, to be true because we believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ: we found our belief in the miracles on the Gospel, not our belief in the Gospel on the miracles. 
因为我们首先相信福音奇迹是真实的而接受基督教似乎是不可思议的，而主要因为我们相信最近的奇迹是真实的而接受基督教似乎是不敬虔的；因为我们相信福音奇迹是真实的。我们接受奇迹或某些奇迹是真实的，因为我们相信耶稣基督的福音：我们发现我们对福音的奇迹的信仰，而不是我们对奇迹的福音的信仰。
But it must be remembered that Pascal had been deeply impressed by a contemporary miracle, known as the miracle of the Holy Thorn: a thorn reputed to have been preserved from the Crown of Our Lord was pressed upon an ulcer which quickly healed. 
但必须记住，帕斯卡对当时的一个奇迹印象深刻，这个奇迹被称为圣荆棘奇迹：一根据说是从我们主的王冠上保存下来的荆棘被压在溃疡上，很快就愈合了。
Sainte-Beuve, who as a medical man felt himself on solid ground, discusses fully the possible explanation of this apparent miracle. 
作为一名医生，圣伯夫感到自己脚踏实地，他充分讨论了对这一明显奇迹的可能解释。
It is true that the miracle happened at Port-Royal, and that it arrived opportunely to revive the depressed spirits of the community in its political afflictions; and it is likely that Pascal was the more inclined to believe a miracle which was performed upon his beloved sister. 
确实，这个奇迹在皇家港发生了，而且它的出现恰逢其时，使社区在政治苦难中沮丧的精神得到了重振。帕斯卡很可能更倾向于相信在他心爱的妹妹身上发生的奇迹。
In any case, it probably led him to assign a place to miracles, in his study of faith, which is not quite that which we should give to them ourselves. 
无论如何，这可能导致他在信仰研究中给奇迹分配了一席之地，而这并不是我们自己应该给予奇迹的地方。
 Now the great adversary against whom Pascal set himself, from the time of his first conversations with M. 
现在，从帕斯卡第一次与M. 交谈时起，他就将自己定为最大的对手。
de Saci at Port-Royal, was Montaigne. 
皇家港的德萨西是蒙田。
One cannot destroy Pascal, certainly; but of all authors Montaigne is one of the least destructible. 
当然，人们无法摧毁帕斯卡；但在所有作家中，蒙田是最不易被摧毁的一位。
You could as well dissipate a fog by flinging hand-grenades into it. 
你也可以通过向雾中扔手榴弹来驱散雾。
For Montaigne is a fog, a gas, a fluid, insidious element. 
对于蒙田来说，它是一种雾、一种气体、一种流动的、阴险的元素。
He does not reason, he insinuates, charms, and influences; or if he reasons, you must be prepared for his having some other design upon you than to convince you by his argument. 
他不讲道理，只用暗示、魅力和影响力；或者，如果他推理，你必须做好准备，因为他对你有其他目的，而不是通过他的论点说服你。
It is hardly too much to say that Montaigne is the most essential author to know, if we would understand the course of French thought during the last three hundred years. 
如果我们想了解过去三百年法国思想的进程，可以说蒙田是最重要的作家。
In every way, the influence of Montaigne was repugnant to the men of Port-Royal. 
从各方面来说，蒙田的影响都令皇家港的人们感到反感。
Pascal studied him with the intention of demolishing him. 
帕斯卡研究着他，意图摧毁他。
"Yet, in the _Pensées_, at the very end of his life, we find passage after passage, and the slighter they are the more significant, almost ""lifted"" out of Montaigne, down to a figure of speech or a word. "
然而，在他生命的最后阶段的《回忆录》中，我们发现了一段又一段的段落，它们越细微，意义就越重大，几乎是从蒙田“提升”出来的，降格为一种修辞格或一个词。
The parallels[A] are most often with the long essay of Montaigne called _Apologie de Raymond Sébond_--an astonishing piece of writing upon which Shakespeare also probably drew in _Hamlet_. 
最常见的相似之处是蒙田的长文《雷蒙德·塞邦的道歉》——莎士比亚可能也借鉴了这篇令人惊叹的文章《哈姆雷特》。
Indeed, by the time a man knew Montaigne well enough to attack him, he would already be thoroughly infected by him. 
确实，当一个人足够了解蒙田并攻击他时，他已经被他彻底感染了。
     [A] Cf. 
 [A] 参见。
the use of the simile of the _couvreur_. 
使用_couvreur_ 的明喻。
For comparing     parallel passages, the edition of the _Pensées_ by Henri Massis (_A     la cité des livres_) is better than the two-volume edition of     Jacques Chevalier (Gabalda). 
为了比较平行段落，亨利·马西斯 (_A la cité des livres_) 的《Pensées_》版本优于雅克·谢瓦利埃 (Gabalda) 的两卷本。
It seems just possible that in the     latter edition, and also in his biographical study (_Pascal_; by     Jacques Chevalier, English translation, published by Sheed & Ward),     M. 
似乎有可能在后一版本以及他的传记研究中（_Pascal_；Jacques Chevalier 着，英文翻译，Sheed & Ward 出版），M.
Chevalier is a little over-zealous to demonstrate the perfect     orthodoxy of Pascal. 
谢瓦利埃有点过于热衷于展示帕斯卡的完美正统思想。
 It would, however, be grossly unfair to Pascal, to Montaigne, and indeed to French literature, to leave the matter at that. 
然而，如果就此置之不理，对帕斯卡、蒙田乃至法国文学都是极不公平的。
It is no diminution of Pascal, but only an aggrandisement of Montaigne. 
它并不是对帕斯卡的贬低，而只是对蒙田的强化。
"Had Montaigne been an ordinary life-sized sceptic, a small man like Anatole France, or even a greater man like Renan, or even like the greatest sceptic of all, Voltaire, this ""influence"" would be to the discredit of Pascal; but if Montaigne had been no more than Voltaire, he could not have affected Pascal at all. "
如果蒙田是一个普通的真人大小的怀疑论者，一个像阿纳托尔·法朗斯那样的小人物，或者甚至是一个像勒南这样的伟大人物，甚至像最伟大的怀疑论者伏尔泰那样，那么这种“影响”就会使帕斯卡名誉扫地。但如果蒙田只不过是伏尔泰，他根本不可能影响帕斯卡。
"The picture of Montaigne which offers itself first to our eyes, that of the original and independent solitary ""personality,"" absorbed in amused analysis of himself, is deceptive. "
蒙田首先呈现在我们眼前的形象，即原始的、独立的、孤独的“人格”，全神贯注于对自己的有趣分析，是具有欺骗性的。
Montaigne's is no _limited_ Pyrrhonism, like that of Voltaire, Renan, or France. 
蒙田的皮浪主义并不像伏尔泰、勒南或法国那样。
He exists, so to speak, on a plan of numerous concentric circles, the most apparent of which is the small inmost circle, a personal puckish scepticism which can be easily aped if not imitated. 
可以说，他存在于一个由无数同心圆组成的平面上，其中最明显的是最里面的小圆，这是一种个人顽皮的怀疑主义，即使不被模仿，也很容易被模仿。
But what makes Montaigne a very great figure is that he succeeded, God knows how--for Montaigne very likely did not know that he had done it--it is not the sort of thing that men _can_ observe about themselves, for it is essentially bigger than the individual's consciousness--he succeeded in giving expression to the scepticism of _every_ human being. 
但是，蒙田之所以成为一个非常伟大的人物，是因为他成功了，天知道他是如何做到的——因为蒙田很可能不知道他已经做到了——这不是人们可以观察到的关于自己的事情，因为它本质上是比个人的意识更大——他成功地表达了每个人的怀疑主义。
For every man who thinks and lives by thought must have his own scepticism, that which stops at the question, that which ends in denial, or that which leads to faith and which is somehow integrated into the faith which transcends it. 
因为每个思考并靠思想生活的人都必须有自己的怀疑主义，这种怀疑主义止于问题，以否认结束，或者导致信仰并以某种方式融入超越信仰的信仰。
And Pascal, as the type of one kind of religious believer, which is highly passionate and ardent, but passionate only through a powerful and regulated intellect, is in the first sections of his unfinished Apology for Christianity facing unflinchingly the demon of doubt which is inseparable from the spirit of belief. 
而帕斯卡，作为一种宗教信徒的类型，具有高度的热情和热情，但热情只有通过强大而受约束的智力才能实现，在他未完成的《基督教辩护》的第一部分中，他毫不畏惧地面对着与此密不可分的怀疑恶魔。来自信仰的精神。
 There is accordingly something quite different from an influence which would prove Pascal's weakness; there is a real affinity between his doubt and that of Montaigne; and through the common kinship with Montaigne Pascal is related to the noble and distinguished line of French moralists, from La Rochefoucauld down. 
因此，有一种与证明帕斯卡弱点的影响完全不同的东西。他的怀疑与蒙田的怀疑之间有着真正的相似之处。通过与蒙田·帕斯卡的共同血缘关系，与自拉罗什福科以下的法国道德家的高贵而杰出的血统有关。
In the honesty with which they face the _données_ of the actual world this French tradition has a unique quality in European literature, and in the seventeenth century Hobbes is crude and uncivilised in comparison. 
在他们面对现实世界的“Données”的诚实中，这一法国传统在欧洲文学中具有独特的品质，而十七世纪的霍布斯相比之下就显得粗鲁和不文明。
 Pascal is a man of the world among ascetics, and an ascetic among men of the world; he had the knowledge of worldliness and the passion of asceticism, and in him the two are fused into an individual whole. 
帕斯卡是苦行者中的世人，也是世人中的苦行者。他具有世俗的知识和禁欲主义的热情，在他身上，两者融合成一个个体的整体。
The majority of mankind is lazy-minded, incurious, absorbed in vanities, and tepid in emotion, and is therefore incapable of either much doubt or much faith; and when the ordinary man calls himself a sceptic or an unbeliever, that is ordinarily a simple pose, cloaking a disinclination to think anything out to a conclusion. 
大多数人思想懒惰，缺乏好奇心，沉迷于虚荣，情感不温不火，因此既没有能力去怀疑，也没有能力去相信。当普通人称自己为怀疑论者或不信者时，这通常是一种简单的姿态，掩盖了不愿思考任何事情得出结论的态度。
Pascal's disillusioned analysis of human bondage is sometimes interpreted to mean that Pascal was really and finally an unbeliever, who, in his despair, was incapable of enduring reality and enjoying the heroic satisfaction of the free man's worship of nothing. 
帕斯卡对人类束缚的幻灭分析有时被解释为意味着帕斯卡实际上是一个最终的不信者，他在绝望中无法忍受现实，也无法享受自由人对虚无的崇拜所带来的英雄般的满足。
His despair, his disillusion, are, however, no illustration of personal weakness; they are perfectly objective, because they are essential moments in the progress of the intellectual soul; and for the type of Pascal they are the analogue of the drought, the dark night, which is an essential stage in the progress of the Christian mystic. 
然而，他的绝望、他的幻想破灭，并不是个人软弱的表现；它们是完全客观的，因为它们是智力灵魂进步的重要时刻；对于帕斯卡的类型来说，它们类似于干旱、黑夜，这是基督教神秘主义进步的一个重要阶段。
A similar despair, when it is arrived at by a diseased character or an impure soul, may issue in the most disastrous consequences though with the most superb manifestations; and thus we get _Gulliver's Travels_; but in Pascal we find no such distortion; his despair is in itself more terrible than Swift's, because our heart tells us that it corresponds exactly to the facts and cannot be dismissed as mental disease; but it was also a despair which was a necessary prelude to, and element in, the joy of faith. 
当一个有病的人或一个不纯洁的灵魂陷入类似的绝望时，尽管表现得最美妙，但可能会带来最灾难性的后果。这样我们就得到了《格列佛游记》；但在帕斯卡中我们没有发现这种扭曲。他的绝望本身比斯威夫特的更可怕，因为我们的内心告诉我们，这完全符合事实，不能被视为精神疾病而被忽视；但这也是一种绝望，它是信仰之乐的必要前奏和要素。
 I do not wish to enter any further than necessary upon the question of the heterodoxy of Jansenism; and it is no concern of this essay, whether the Five Propositions condemned at Rome were really maintained by Jansenius in his book _Augustinus_; or whether we should deplore or approve the consequent decay (indeed with some persecution) of Port-Royal. 
我不想在詹森主义的异端问题上做任何不必要的讨论。本文并不关心詹森尼乌斯在他的《奥古斯丁》一书中是否真的坚持了罗马所谴责的五项主张；或者我们是否应该对皇家港随之而来的衰落（实际上是一些迫害）感到遗憾或赞同。
It is impossible to discuss the matter without becoming involved as a controversialist either for or against Rome. 
讨论这个问题而不成为支持或反对罗马的争议者是不可能的。
But in a man of the type of Pascal--and the type always exists--there is, I think, an ingredient of what may be called Jansenism of temperament, without identifying it with the Jansenism of Jansenius and of other devout and sincere, but not immensely gifted doctors.[B] It is accordingly needful to state in brief what the dangerous doctrine of Jansenius was, without advancing too far into theological refinements. 
但是，在帕斯卡这种类型的人身上——这种类型总是存在的——我认为，有一种可以称为气质的詹森主义的成分，但不将其与詹森尼乌斯和其他虔诚而真诚的人的詹森主义等同起来， [B] 因此，有必要简要说明詹森尼乌斯的危险学说是什么，但又不要在神学上过于精炼。
It is recognised in Christian theology--and indeed on a lower plane it is recognised by all men in affairs of daily life--that freewill or the natural effort and ability of the individual man, and also supernatural _grace_, a gift accorded we know not quite how, are both required, in co-operation, for salvation. 
基督教神学承认——事实上，在较低的层面上，日常生活中的所有人都承认——个人的自由意志或自然的努力和能力，以及超自然的恩典，我们知道这是一种恩赐。不完全是这样，两者都需要合作才能获得拯救。
Though numerous theologians have set their wits at the problem, it ends in a mystery which we can perceive but not finally decipher. 
尽管许多神学家对这个问题绞尽脑汁，但它最终还是一个我们可以感知但最终无法破译的谜团。
At least, it is obvious that, like any doctrine, a slight excess or deviation to one side or the other will precipitate a heresy. 
至少，很明显，就像任何教义一样，稍微超出或偏向某一方或另一方就会引发异端邪说。
The Pelagians, who were refuted by St. 
被圣约翰驳斥的伯拉纠派。
Augustine, emphasised the efficacy of human effort and belittled the importance of supernatural grace. 
奥古斯丁强调人类努力的功效，贬低超自然恩典的重要性。
The Calvinists emphasised the degradation of man through Original Sin, and considered mankind so corrupt that the will was of no avail; and thus fell into the doctrine of predestination. 
加尔文主义者强调人因原罪而堕落，认为人类如此腐败以致意志无济于事；从而落入了预定论的教义之中。
It was upon the doctrine of grace according to St. 
这是根据圣约翰的恩典教义。
Augustine that the Jansenists relied; and the _Augustinus_ of Jansenius was presented as a sound exposition of the Augustinian views. 
詹森派所信赖的奥古斯丁；詹森尼乌斯的《奥古斯丁》是对奥古斯丁观点的合理阐述。
     [B] The great man of Port-Royal was of course Saint-Cyran, but any     one who is interested will certainly consult, first of all, the book     of Sainte-Beuve mentioned. 
 [B] 皇家港的伟人当然是圣西兰，但任何有兴趣的人肯定会首先查阅提到的圣伯夫的书。
 Such heresies are never antiquated, because they forever assume new forms. 
这些异端邪说永远不会过时，因为它们永远呈现出新的形式。
"For instance, the insistence upon good works and ""service"" which is preached from many quarters, or the simple faith that any one who lives a good and useful life need have no ""morbid"" anxieties about salvation, is a form of Pelagianism. "
例如，多方宣扬的对善行和“服务”的坚持，或者简单的信念，即任何过着美好而有用的生活的人都不需要对救赎有“病态”的焦虑，都是伯拉纠主义的一种形式。
On the other hand, one sometimes hears enounced the view that it will make no real difference if all the traditional religious sanctions for moral behaviour break down, because those who are born and bred to be nice people will always prefer to behave nicely, and those who are not will behave otherwise in any case: and this is surely a form of predestination--for the hazard of being born a nice person or not is as uncertain as the gift of grace. 
另一方面，人们有时会听到这样的观点：如果所有传统的宗教道德制裁都被打破，那也没有什么真正的区别，因为那些生来就是好人的人总是更愿意表现得好，而那些无论如何，不善良的人都会有不同的行为：这无疑是一种注定的形式——因为生来就是好人与否的风险就像恩典的恩赐一样不确定。
 It is likely that Pascal was attracted as much by the fruits of Jansenism in the life of Port-Royal as by the doctrine itself. 
帕斯卡很可能既被皇家港生活中詹森主义的成果所吸引，也被该学说本身所吸引。
This devout, ascetic, thoroughgoing society, striving heroically in the midst of a relaxed and easy-going Christianity, was formed to attract a nature so concentrated, so passionate, and so thoroughgoing as Pascal's. 
这个虔诚、禁欲、彻底的社会，在轻松、随和的基督教氛围中英勇地奋斗，其形成是为了吸引像帕斯卡这样专注、热情、彻底的人。
But the insistence upon the degraded and helpless state of man, in Jansenism, is something also to which we must be grateful, for to it we owe the magnificent analysis of human motives and occupations which was to have constituted the early part of his book. 
但是，詹森主义对人的堕落和无助状态的坚持也是我们必须感激的，因为正是由于它，我们才对人类的动机和职业进行了精彩的分析，而这正是构成了他的书的前半部分。
And apart from the Jansenism which is the work of a not very eminent bishop who wrote a Latin treatise which is now unread, there is also, so to speak, a Jansenism of the individual biography. 
除了詹森主义（一位不太知名的主教写了一篇拉丁文论文但现在无人阅读）之外，可以说，还有一种个人传记的詹森主义。
A moment of Jansenism may naturally take place, and take place rightly, in the individual; particularly in the life of a man of great and intense intellectual powers, who cannot avoid seeing through human beings and observing the vanity of their thoughts and of their avocations, their dishonesty and self-deceptions, the insincerity of their emotions, their cowardice, the pettiness of their real ambitions. 
詹森主义的时刻可能会自然地发生在个人身上，并且正确地发生在个人身上。尤其是在一个具有伟大而强烈的智力的人的生活中，他无法避免看穿人类并观察他们思想和爱好的虚荣，他们的不诚实和自欺欺人，他们情感的不真诚，他们的怯懦，他们真正的野心是微不足道的。
Actually, considering that Pascal died at the age of thirty-nine, one must be amazed at the balance and justice of his observations; much greater maturity is required for these qualities, than for any mathematical or scientific greatness. 
事实上，考虑到帕斯卡在三十九岁时去世，人们一定会对他的观察的平衡性和公正性感到惊讶；与任何数学或科学的伟大相比，这些品质需要更大的成熟度。
How easily his brooding on _the misery of man without God_ might have encouraged in him the sin of spiritual pride, the _concupiscence de l'esprit_, and how fast a hold he has of humility!  And although Pascal brings to his work the same powers which he exerted in science, it is not as a scientist that he presents himself. 
他对没有上帝的人类苦难的沉思多么容易就助长了他精神骄傲的罪恶，精神的贪欲，而他又多么坚定地保持着谦卑！尽管帕斯卡在他的作品中带来了他在科学中所发挥的同样的力量，但他并不是以科学家的身份来表现自己。
He does not seem to say to the reader: I am one of the most distinguished scientists of the day; I understand many matters which will always be mysteries to you, and through science I have come to the Faith; you therefore who are not initiated into science ought to have faith if I have it. 
他似乎并没有对读者说：我是当今最杰出的科学家之一；我是当今最杰出的科学家之一。我了解许多对你们来说永远是神秘的事情，通过科学我已经找到了信仰；因此，如果我有信仰的话，那些没有接触过科学的人也应该有信仰。
He is fully aware of the difference of subject-matter; and his famous distinction between the _esprit de géométrie_ and the _esprit de finesse_ is one to ponder over. 
他充分意识到题材的差异；他对“几何精神”和“精细精神”之间的著名区分值得深思。
It is the just combination of the scientist, the _honnête homme_, and the religious nature with a passionate craving for God, that makes Pascal unique. 
正是科学家、“honnête homme”与对上帝的热情渴望的宗教本性的完美结合，使帕斯卡变得独一无二。
He succeeds where Descartes fails; for in Descartes the element of _esprit de géométrie_ is excessive.[C] And in a few phrases about Descartes, in the present book, Pascal laid his finger on the place of weakness. 
笛卡尔失败的地方他成功了；因为在笛卡尔那里，几何精神的元素是过度的。[C] 在本书中，在关于笛卡尔的几句话中，帕斯卡指出了弱点。
     [C] For a brilliant criticism of the errors of Descartes from a     theological point of view the reader is referred to _Three     Reformers_ by Jacques Maritain (translation published by Sheed &     Ward). 
[C] 对于从神学角度对笛卡尔错误的精彩批评，读者可以参考雅克·马里坦（Jacques Maritain）的《三个改革者》（Sheed & Ward 出版的译本）。
 He who reads this book will observe at once its fragmentary nature; but only after some study will perceive that the fragmentariness lies in the expression more than in the thought. 
读过这本书的人会立刻发现它的支离破碎的本质。但只有经过一番研究后才会发现，碎片化更多地在于表达而不是思想。
"The ""thoughts"" cannot be detached from each other and quoted as if each were complete in itself. "
这些“思想”不能彼此分离并被引用，就好像每个思想本身都是完整的一样。
"_Le cœur a ses raisons que la raison ne connaît point_: how often one has heard that quoted, and quoted often to the wrong purpose! For this is by no means an exaltation of the ""heart"" over the ""head,"" a defence of unreason. "
 _Le cœur a ses raisons que la raison ne connaît point_：人们经常听到有人引用这句话，而且引用的目的常常是错误的！因为这绝不是把“心”抬高到“头脑”之上，也不是对非理性的辩护。
The heart, in Pascal's terminology, is itself truly rational if it is truly the heart. 
用帕斯卡的术语来说，如果心真的是心，那么它本身就是真正理性的。
For him, in theological matters, which seemed to him much larger, more difficult, and more important than scientific matters, the whole personality is involved. 
对他来说，在他看来比科学问题更大、更困难、更重要的神学问题中，涉及到整个人格。
 We cannot quite understand any of the parts, fragmentary as they are, without some understanding of the whole. 
如果不了解整体，我们就无法完全理解任何部分，尽管它们是支离破碎的。
Capital, for instance, is his analysis of the _three orders_: the order of nature, the order of mind, and the order of charity. 
例如，《资本论》是他对“三个秩序”的分析：自然秩序、心灵秩序和慈善秩序。
These three are _discontinuous_; the higher is not implicit in the lower as in an evolutionary doctrine it would be.[D] In this distinction Pascal offers much about which the modern world would do well to think. 
这三个是_不连续的_；高级并不像进化论那样隐含在低级中。[D]在这一区分中，帕斯卡提供了许多值得现代世界思考的内容。
And indeed, because of his unique combination and balance of qualities, I know of no religious writer more pertinent to our time. 
事实上，由于他独特的品质组合和平衡，据我所知，没有哪个宗教作家比我们这个时代更贴切。
The great mystics like St. 
像圣约翰这样伟大的神秘主义者。
John of the Cross, are primarily for readers with a special determination of purpose; the devotional writers, such as St. 
 《十字架约翰》主要面向有特殊目的的读者；虔诚的作家，例如圣。
François de Sales, are primarily for those who already feel consciously desirous of the love of God; the great theologians are for those interested in theology. 
弗朗索瓦·德·塞莱斯（François de Sales）主要是为那些已经有意识地渴望上帝之爱的人而写的；伟大的神学家是为那些对神学感兴趣的人而写的。
But I can think of no Christian writer, not Newman even, more to be commended than Pascal to those who doubt, but who have the mind to conceive, and the sensibility to feel, the disorder, the futility, the meaninglessness, the mystery of life and suffering, and who can only find peace through a satisfaction of the whole being. 
但我认为没有哪个基督教作家，甚至纽曼，比帕斯卡更值得那些怀疑的人赞扬，但他们有头脑去构想，有情感去感受，混乱，徒劳，无意义，神秘。生命和痛苦，只有通过整个存在的满足才能找到平安。
     [D] An important modern theory of discontinuity, suggested partly by     Pascal, is sketched in the collected fragments of _Speculations_ by     T. 
 [D] 一个重要的现代不连续理论，部分由帕斯卡提出，在 T.《推测》收集的片段中概述。

    SECTION I  THOUGHTS ON MIND AND ON STYLE   1   _The difference between the mathematical and the intuitive mind._[1]--In the one the principles are palpable, but removed from ordinary use; so that for want of habit it is difficult to turn one's mind in that direction: but if one turns it thither ever so little, one sees the principles fully, and one must have a quite inaccurate mind who reasons wrongly from principles so plain that it is almost impossible they should escape notice. 
第一节关于心灵和风格 1 的想法_数学思维与直觉思维之间的区别。_[1]--在其中，原则是显而易见的，但与日常使用无关；因此，由于缺乏习惯，很难将一个人的思想转向那个方向：但是，如果一个人很少转向这个方向，那么他就可以充分地看到原理，并且一个人一定有一个非常不准确的思想，他从如此简单的原理中错误地推理，以至于无法理解。他们几乎不可能逃脱人们的注意。
 But in the intuitive mind the principles are found in common use, and are before the eyes of everybody. 
但在直觉思维中，这些原理是普遍使用的，并且在每个人的眼前。
One has only to look, and no effort is necessary; it is only a question of good eyesight, but it must be good, for the principles are so subtle and so numerous, that it is almost impossible but that some escape notice. 
只要看看，不用费力；这只是一个视力良好的问题，但它必须是好的，因为原理是如此微妙和如此众多，以至于几乎不可能不让一些人注意到。
Now the omission of one principle leads to error; thus one must have very clear sight to see all the principles, and in the next place an accurate mind not to draw false deductions from known principles. 
现在，忽略一项原则就会导致错误；而忽略一项原则就会导致错误。因此，一个人必须有非常清晰的视力才能看到所有的原理，其次必须有一个准确的头脑，以免从已知的原理中得出错误的推论。
 All mathematicians would then be intuitive if they had clear sight, for they do not reason incorrectly from principles known to them; and intuitive minds would be mathematical if they could turn their eyes to the principles of mathematics to which they are unused. 
如果所有数学家都有清晰的视野，那么他们就会具有直觉，因为他们不会根据他们已知的原理进行错误的推理；如果直觉思维能够将目光转向他们不熟悉的数学原理，那么他们就会成为数学家。
 The reason, therefore, that some intuitive minds are not mathematical is that they cannot at all turn their attention to the principles of mathematics. 
因此，一些直觉思维不是数学的原因是他们根本无法将注意力转向数学原理。
But the reason that mathematicians are not intuitive is that they do not see what is before them, and that, accustomed to the exact and plain principles of mathematics, and not reasoning till they have well inspected and arranged their principles, they are lost in matters of intuition where the principles do not allow of such arrangement. 
但数学家不具备直觉的原因是他们看不到眼前的事物，而且习惯于精确而简单的数学原理，在充分检查和整理原理之前不进行推理，他们迷失在事物中当原则不允许这种安排时，就需要依靠直觉。
They are scarcely seen; they are felt rather than seen; there is the greatest difficulty in making them felt by those who do not of themselves perceive them. 
他们很少被看见；它们是被感觉到的而不是被看到的；要让那些本身没有察觉到它们的人感受到它们是非常困难的。
These principles are so fine and so numerous that a very delicate and very clear sense is needed to perceive them, and to judge rightly and justly when they are perceived, without for the most part being able to demonstrate them in order as in mathematics; because the principles are not known to us in the same way, and because it would be an endless matter to undertake it. 
这些原理是如此精细和如此众多，以至于需要一种非常微妙和非常清晰的感觉来感知它们，并在感知到它们时做出正确和公正的判断，而在很大程度上无法像数学那样按顺序证明它们；因为我们并不以同样的方式了解这些原则，而且因为实施它将是一个无休无止的事情。
We must see the matter at once, at one glance, and not by a process of reasoning, at least to a certain degree. 
我们必须一眼就能看出问题，而不是通过推理过程，至少在某种程度上是这样。
And thus it is rare that mathematicians are intuitive, and that men of intuition are mathematicians, because mathematicians wish to treat matters of intuition mathematically, and make themselves ridiculous, wishing to begin with definitions and then with axioms, which is not the way to proceed in this kind of reasoning. 
因此，数学家是直觉的，而有直觉的人是数学家，是很少见的，因为数学家希望用数学的方式来处理直觉的问题，从而使自己变得可笑，希望从定义开始，然后从公理开始，这不是进行下去的方法。在这样的推理中。
Not that the mind does not do so, but it does it tacitly, naturally, and without technical rules; for the expression of it is beyond all men, and only a few can feel it. 
并不是说头脑不这样做，而是心照不宣地、自然地、没有技术规则地这样做；因为它的表达是超越所有人的，只有少数人能够感受到它。
 Intuitive minds, on the contrary, being thus accustomed to judge at a single glance, are so astonished when they are presented with propositions of which they understand nothing, and the way to which is through definitions and axioms so sterile, and which they are not accustomed to see thus in detail, that they are repelled and disheartened. 
相反，直觉思维习惯于一眼就做出判断，当他们遇到他们一无所知的命题时，他们会感到非常惊讶，而通过定义和公理得出的方法是如此贫乏，而他们并不了解这些命题。习惯于看到这样的细节，他们感到排斥和沮丧。
 But dull minds are never either intuitive or mathematical. 
但迟钝的头脑从来都不是直觉的或数学的。
 Mathematicians who are only mathematicians have exact minds, provided all things are explained to them by means of definitions and axioms; otherwise they are inaccurate and insufferable, for they are only right when the principles are quite clear. 
数学家只是数学家，他们拥有精确的头脑，只要一切事物都通过定义和公理向他们解释；否则它们就是不准确和令人难以忍受的，因为只有当原则非常明确时它们才是正确的。
 And men of intuition who are only intuitive cannot have the patience to reach to first principles of things speculative and conceptual, which they have never seen in the world, and which are altogether out of the common. 
具有直觉的人如果只是凭直觉，就无法有耐心去触及思辨性和概念性事物的首要原则，这些事物是他们在世界上从未见过的，而且是完全不寻常的。
  2  There are different kinds of right understanding;[2] some have right understanding in a certain order of things, and not in others, where they go astray. 
 2 正知有不同的种类；[2] 有些人对事物的某种顺序有正知，而另一些则没有正知，因此它们会误入歧途。
Some draw conclusions well from a few premises, and this displays an acute judgment. 
有些人从几个前提就得出了很好的结论，这表现出了敏锐的判断力。
 Others draw conclusions well where there are many premises. 
其他人在有很多前提的情况下也能很好地得出结论。
 For example, the former easily learn hydrostatics, where the premises are few, but the conclusions are so fine that only the greatest acuteness can reach them. 
例如，前者很容易学静水力学，前提很少，但结论却很精细，只有最敏锐的人才能得出。
 And in spite of that these persons would perhaps not be great mathematicians, because mathematics contain a great number of premises, and there is perhaps a kind of intellect that can search with ease a few premises to the bottom, and cannot in the least penetrate those matters in which there are many premises. 
尽管如此，这些人也许不会成为伟大的数学家，因为数学包含大量的前提，而也许存在一种智力，可以轻松地探寻几个前提到底，却丝毫不能洞察那些前提。有很多前提的事情。
 There are then two kinds of intellect: the one able to penetrate acutely and deeply into the conclusions of given premises, and this is the precise intellect; the other able to comprehend a great number of premises without confusing them, and this is the mathematical intellect. 
那么，智力有两种：一种是能够敏锐而深入地洞察给定前提的结论，这是精确的智力；另一种是能够敏锐而深入地洞察给定前提的结论，这是精确的智力。另一个能够理解大量前提而不混淆它们，这就是数学智力。
The one has force and exactness, the other comprehension. 
一个具有力量和准确性，另一个具有理解力。
Now the one quality can exist without the other; the intellect can be strong and narrow, and can also be comprehensive and weak. 
现在，一种品质可以在没有另一种品质的情况下存在；智力可以强而狭，也可以全面而弱。
  3  Those who are accustomed to judge by feeling do not understand the process of reasoning, for they would understand at first sight, and are not used to seek for principles. 
 3 习惯凭感觉判断的人，不懂得推理的过程，一目了然，不习惯寻求原理。
And others, on the contrary, who are accustomed to reason from principles, do not at all understand matters of feeling, seeking principles, and being unable to see at a glance. 
而另一些人则恰恰相反，习惯于道理推理的人，根本不懂感情、寻求道理、一眼看不出来的事情。
  4  _Mathematics, intuition._--True eloquence makes light of eloquence, true morality makes light of morality; that is to say, the morality of the judgment, which has no rules, makes light of the morality of the intellect. 
 4_数学、直觉。_--真正的口才轻视口才，真正的道德轻视道德；也就是说，没有规则的判断的道德轻视了理智的道德。
 For it is to judgment that perception belongs, as science belongs to intellect. 
因为知觉属于判断，就像科学属于智力一样。
Intuition is the part of judgment, mathematics of intellect. 
直觉是判断的一部分，是智力的数学。
 To make light of philosophy is to be a true philosopher. 
轻视哲学才是真正的哲学家。
  5  Those who judge of a work by rule[3] are in regard to others as those who have a watch are in regard to others. 
 5 那些按规则评判作品的人[3] 对待他人，就像那些有手表的人对待他人一样。
"One says, ""It is two hours ago""; the other says, ""It is only three-quarters of an hour."" I look at my watch, and say to the one, ""You are weary,"" and to the other, ""Time gallops with you""; for it is only an hour and a half ago, and I laugh at those who tell me that time goes slowly with me, and that I judge by imagination. "
一个说：“这是两个小时前”；另一个说：“只有三刻钟了。”我看看手表，对其中一个说：“你累了”，对另一个说：“时间与你一起飞驰”；因为这只是一个半小时前的事，我嘲笑那些告诉我时间过得很慢、我凭想象来判断的人。
They do not know that I judge by my watch.[4]   6  Just as we harm the understanding, we harm the feelings also. 
他们不知道我是通过手表来判断的。[4] 6 正如我们损害了悟性一样，我们也损害了感情。
 The understanding and the feelings are moulded by intercourse; the understanding and feelings are corrupted by intercourse. 
理解和感情是在交往中塑造的；理解和感情因交往而被腐蚀。
Thus good or bad society improves or corrupts them. 
因此，好的或坏的社会都会改善或腐蚀他们。
It is, then, all-important to know how to choose in order to improve and not to corrupt them; and we cannot make this choice, if they be not already improved and not corrupted. 
因此，最重要的是要知道如何选择，以便改进而不是腐蚀它们。如果它们没有得到改善并且没有被破坏，我们就无法做出这样的选择。
Thus a circle is formed, and those are fortunate who escape it. 
这样就形成了一个圆圈，逃脱这个圆圈的人是幸运的。
  7  The greater intellect one has, the more originality one finds in men. 
 7 一个人的智力越高，他就越能发现人的独创性。

  8  There are many people who listen to a sermon in the same way as they listen to vespers. 
 8 有很多人听布道就像听晚祷一样。
  9  When we wish to correct with advantage, and to show another that he errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter, for on that side it is usually true, and admit that truth to him, but reveal to him the side on which it is false. 
 9 当我们希望有利地纠正，并向他人表明他的错误时，我们必须注意他从哪一方面看待问题，因为那一方面通常是正确的，并向他承认这一事实，但向他揭示另一面这是错误的。
He is satisfied with that, for he sees that he was not mistaken, and that he only failed to see all sides. 
他对此很满意，因为他看到自己没有看错，只是没有看到所有方面。
Now, no one is offended at not seeing everything; but one does not like to be mistaken, and that perhaps arises from the fact that man naturally cannot see everything, and that naturally he cannot err in the side he looks at, since the perceptions of our senses are always true. 
现在，没有人会因为看不到一切而感到生气；但人们不喜欢犯错，这也许是因为人天生就不能看到一切，而且他自然不可能在他所看到的一面犯错，因为我们感官的感知总是正确的。
  10  People are generally better persuaded by the reasons which they have themselves discovered than by those which have come into the mind of others. 
 10 人们通常更容易被自己发现的理由所说服，而不是被别人想到的理由所说服。
  11  All great amusements are dangerous to the Christian life; but among all those which the world has invented there is none more to be feared than the theatre. 
11 所有伟大的娱乐对基督徒的生活都是危险的；但在世人发明的所有发明中，没有什么比戏剧更令人畏惧的了。
It is a representation of the passions so natural and so delicate that it excites them and gives birth to them in our hearts, and, above all, to that of love, principally when it is represented as very chaste and virtuous. 
它是激情的表现，如此自然和微妙，以至于激发它们并在我们心中孕育它们，最重要的是，它是爱的激情，尤其是当它被表现为非常贞洁和美德时。
For the more innocent it appears to innocent souls, the more they are likely to be touched by it. 
对于无辜的灵魂来说，它越显得无辜，他们就越有可能被它感动。
Its violence pleases our self-love, which immediately forms a desire to produce the same effects which are seen so well represented; and, at the same time, we make ourselves a conscience founded on the propriety of the feelings which we see there, by which the fear of pure souls is removed, since they imagine that it cannot hurt their purity to love with a love which seems to them so reasonable. 
它的暴力取悦了我们的自爱，我们立即产生了产生同样效果的愿望，正如我们所看到的那样。同时，我们使自己的良心建立在我们所看到的情感的适当性之上，由此消除了对纯洁灵魂的恐惧，因为他们认为，以看似表面上的爱去爱，不会损害他们的纯洁性。对他们来说如此合理。
 So we depart from the theatre with our heart so filled with all the beauty and tenderness of love, the soul and the mind so persuaded of its innocence, that we are quite ready to receive its first impressions, or rather to seek an opportunity of awakening them in the heart of another, in order that we may receive the same pleasures and the same sacrifices which we have seen so well represented in the theatre. 
因此，我们离开剧院时，心中充满了爱的所有美丽和温柔，灵魂和思想都相信自己的纯真，我们已经准备好接受它的第一印象，或者更确切地说，寻求一个觉醒的机会他们在另一个人的心中，以便我们可以得到同样的快乐和同样的牺牲，就像我们在戏剧中看到的那样。

  13  One likes to see the error, the passion of Cleobuline,[7] because she is unconscious of it. 
 13 人们喜欢看到克莱布林的错误和激情，[7] 因为她没有意识到这一点。
She would be displeasing, if she were not deceived. 
如果她没有被欺骗的话，她会很不高兴。
  14  When a natural discourse paints a passion or an effect, one feels within oneself the truth of what one reads, which was there before, although one did not know it. 
 14 当一种自然的话语描绘出一种激情或一种效果时，一个人会在自己内心感受到所读内容的真实性，它以前就存在，尽管人们不知道它。
Hence one is inclined to love him who makes us feel it, for he has not shown us his own riches, but ours. 
因此，一个人会倾向于爱那些让我们感受到这一点的人，因为他没有向我们展示他自己的财富，而是我们的财富。
And thus this benefit renders him pleasing to us, besides that such community of intellect as we have with him necessarily inclines the heart to love. 
因此，这种好处使他令我们感到高兴，此外，我们与他之间的智力共同体必然会让人产生爱的心。
  15  Eloquence, which persuades by sweetness, not by authority; as a tyrant, not as a king. 
 15 口才，靠甜言蜜语说服人，不靠权威；作为一个暴君，而不是作为一个国王。
  16  Eloquence is an art of saying things in such a way--(1) that those to whom we speak may listen to them without pain and with pleasure; (2) that they feel themselves interested, so that self-love leads them more willingly to reflection upon it. 
 16 口才是一门以这样的方式说话的艺术——（1）让我们说话的人可以毫无痛苦、愉快地听我们说话； （2）他们感到自己感兴趣，因此自爱使他们更愿意反思它。
 It consists, then, in a correspondence which we seek to establish between the head and the heart of those to whom we speak on the one hand, and, on the other, between the thoughts and the expressions which we employ. 
因此，它一方面在于我们试图在我们交谈对象的头脑和心灵之间建立一种对应关系，另一方面，在我们所使用的思想和表达方式之间建立这种对应关系。
This assumes that we have studied well the heart of man so as to know all its powers, and then to find the just proportions of the discourse which we wish to adapt to them. 
这假设我们已经很好地研究了人的内心，以便了解它的所有力量，然后找到我们希望适应它们的话语的正确比例。
We must put ourselves in the place of those who are to hear us, and make trial on our own heart of the turn which we give to our discourse in order to see whether one is made for the other, and whether we can assure ourselves that the hearer will be, as it were, forced to surrender. 
我们必须把自己放在那些听我们说话的人的位置上，用我们自己的心去试验我们所讲的话语的转向，以便看看一个人是否适合另一个人，以及我们是否可以向自己保证：可以说，听者将被迫投降。
We ought to restrict ourselves, so far as possible, to the simple and natural, and not to magnify that which is little, or belittle that which is great. 
我们应该尽量把自己限制在简单、自然的地方，不要夸大小事，也不要贬低大事。
It is not enough that a thing be beautiful; it must be suitable to the subject, and there must be in it nothing of excess or defect. 
事物仅仅美丽是不够的，它还必须是美丽的。它必须适合主题，并且不能有任何多余或缺陷。
  17  Rivers are roads which move,[8] and which carry us whither we desire to go. 
 17 河流是流动的道路，[8] 它将我们带到我们想去的地方。
  18  When we do not know the truth of a thing, it is of advantage that there should exist a common error which determines the mind of man, as, for example, the moon, to which is attributed the change of seasons, the progress of diseases, etc. 
18 当我们不知道事物的真相时，存在一个决定人的思想的常见错误是有利的，例如，月亮，季节的变化，季节的进展都归因于月亮。疾病等
For the chief malady of man is restless curiosity about things which he cannot understand; and it is not so bad for him to be in error as to be curious to no purpose. 
因为人类的主要弊病就是对他无法理解的事物抱有不安的好奇心。对他来说，犯错误并不比无缘无故地好奇更糟糕。
 The manner in which Epictetus, Montaigne, and Salomon de Tultie[9] wrote, is the most usual, the most suggestive, the most remembered, and the oftenest quoted; because it is entirely composed of thoughts born from the common talk of life. 
爱比克泰德、蒙田和所罗门·德·图尔蒂[9]的写作方式是最常见、最有启发性、最容易被记住和最常被引用的。因为它完全是由生活中常见的谈话所产生的思想组成的。
As when we speak of the common error which exists among men that the moon is the cause of everything, we never fail to say that Salomon de Tultie says that when we do not know the truth of a thing, it is of advantage that there should exist a common error, etc.; which is the thought above. 
正如当我们谈到人类普遍存在的错误，即月亮是万物之因时，我们总是会说所罗门·德·图尔蒂说，当我们不知道事物的真相时，最好知道月亮是万物之源。是否存在常见错误等；这就是上面的想法。
  19  The last thing one settles in writing a book is what one should put in first. 
19 写一本书最后要解决的问题是应该首先写什么。
"  20  _Order._--Why should I undertake to divide my virtues into four rather than into six? Why should I rather establish virtue in four, in two, in one? Why into _Abstine et sustine_[10] rather than into ""Follow Nature,""[11] or, ""Conduct your private affairs without injustice,"" as Plato,[12] or anything else? But there, you will say, everything is contained in one word. "
 20_秩序._--为什么我应该把我的美德分成四种而不是六种？何必立德于四、二、一呢？为什么要进入_Abstine et sustine_[10]而不是进入“遵循自然”，[11]或“不公正地处理你的私人事务”，如柏拉图，[12]或其他什么？但你会说，在那里，一切都包含在一个词中。
Yes, but it is useless without explanation, and when we come to explain it, as soon as we unfold this maxim which contains all the rest, they emerge in that first confusion which you desired to avoid. 
是的，但是如果没有解释，它是没有用的，当我们解释它时，一旦我们展开这条包含所有其余内容的格言，它们就会出现在你想要避免的第一个混乱中。
So, when they are all included in one, they are hidden and useless, as in a chest, and never appear save in their natural confusion. 
因此，当它们全部包含在一个容器中时，它们就被隐藏起来，毫无用处，就像在一个箱子里一样，除了它们自然的混乱之外，永远不会出现。
Nature has established them all without including one in the other. 
大自然已将它们全部建立起来，但并不将其中之一包含在内。
  21  Nature has made all her truths independent of one another. 
 21 大自然使她所有的真理都相互独立。

 I had as soon it said that I used words employed before. 
我一说我就用了以前用过的词。
And in the same way if the same thoughts in a different arrangement do not form a different discourse, no more do the same words in their different arrangement form different thoughts!   23  Words differently arranged have a different meaning, and meanings differently arranged have different effects. 
同样，如果相同的思想在不同的排列中不形成不同的话语，那么相同的词在不同的排列中也不会形成不同的思想！ 23 单词不同的排列有不同的含义，不同的含义排列有不同的效果。
  24  _Language._--We should not turn the mind from one thing to another, except for relaxation, and that when it is necessary and the time suitable, and not otherwise. 
 24_语言._--我们不应该把心思从一件事转到另一件事，除非是为了放松，而且是在必要和时间合适的时候，而不是在其他情况下。
For he that relaxes out of season wearies, and he who wearies us out of season makes us languid, since we turn quite away. 
反季节放松的人会感到疲倦，反季节使我们疲倦的人会使我们变得无精打采，因为我们会转身走开。
So much does our perverse lust like to do the contrary of what those wish to obtain from us without giving us pleasure, the coin for which we will do whatever is wanted. 
我们邪恶的欲望非常喜欢做与那些希望从我们那里得到的东西相反的事情，而不给我们带来快乐，我们可以为所欲为。
  25  _Eloquence._--It requires the pleasant and the real; but the pleasant must itself be drawn from the true. 
 25_口才._--需要愉快而真实；但令人愉快的事物本身必须来自真实的事物。
  26  Eloquence is a painting of thought; and thus those who, after having painted it, add something more, make a picture instead of a portrait. 
 26 口才是思想的画；因此，那些在画完之后再添加一些东西的人，画的是一幅画而不是肖像。
  27  _Miscellaneous. 
 27_杂项。
Language._--Those who make antitheses by forcing words are like those who make false windows for symmetry. 
语言._--那些通过强迫词语来形成对立的人就像那些为对称而制造假窗户的人一样。
Their rule is not to speak accurately, but to make apt figures of speech. 
他们的规则不是说话准确，而是使用恰当的修辞手法。
  28  Symmetry is what we see at a glance; based on the fact that there is no reason for any difference, and based also on the face of man; whence it happens that symmetry is only wanted in breadth, not in height or depth. 
 28 对称是我们一眼看到的；基于没有任何差异的理由这一事实，也基于人的面子；因此，对称性只需要宽度，而不是高度或深度。
  29  When we see a natural style, we are astonished and delighted; for we expected to see an author, and we find a man. 
 29 当我们看到一种自然的风格时，我们会感到惊讶和高兴；因为我们期望看到一位作家，而我们找到了一个人。
Whereas those who have good taste, and who seeing a book expect to find a man, are quite surprised to find an author. 
而那些有品味的人，看到一本书希望找到一个人，却很惊讶地发现一个作者。
_Plus poetice quam humane locutus es._ Those honour Nature well, who teach that she can speak on everything, even on theology.

 31 我们指责西塞罗的所有虚假美女都有他们的崇拜者，而且人数众多。
  32  There is a certain standard of grace and beauty which consists in a certain relation between our nature, such as it is, weak or strong, and the thing which pleases us. 
 32 恩典和美丽有一个特定的标准，它存在于我们的本性（如它的本质，无论是弱还是强）与我们所喜悦的事物之间的某种关系中。
 Whatever is formed according to this standard pleases us, be it house, song, discourse, verse, prose, woman, birds, rivers, trees, rooms, dress, etc. 
凡是按照这个标准形成的东西，无论是房屋、歌曲、话语、诗歌、散文、女人、鸟类、河流、树木、房间、衣服等等，都令我们高兴。
Whatever is not made according to this standard displeases those who have good taste. 
任何不按照这个标准制造的东西都会令那些有品味的人不高兴。
 And as there is a perfect relation between a song and a house which are made after a good model, because they are like this good model, though each after its kind; even so there is a perfect relation between things made after a bad model. 
正如一首歌和一座房子之间存在着完美的关系，它们都是按照一个好的模型建造的，因为它们就像这个好的模型，尽管各有其类；即便如此，在一个糟糕的模型之后做出的东西之间仍然存在着完美的关系。
Not that the bad model is unique, for there are many; but each bad sonnet, for example, on whatever false model it is formed, is just like a woman dressed after that model. 
这并不是说糟糕的模式是独一无二的，因为有很多。但是，例如，每首糟糕的十四行诗，无论它是根据什么虚假模型形成的，都就像一个按照该模型穿着的女人。
 Nothing makes us understand better the ridiculousness of a false sonnet than to consider nature and the standard, and then to imagine a woman or a house made according to that standard. 
没有什么比考虑自然和标准，然后想象根据该标准建造的女人或房屋更能让我们理解虚假十四行诗的荒谬性了。
  33  _Poetical beauty._--As we speak of poetical beauty, so ought we to speak of mathematical beauty and medical beauty. 
 33_诗意之美。_--当我们谈论诗意之美时，我们也应该谈论数学之美和医学之美。
But we do not do so; and the reason is that we know well what is the object of mathematics, and that it consists in proofs, and what is the object of medicine, and that it consists in healing. 
但我们不这样做；原因是我们很清楚数学的目的是什么，它在于证明；医学的目的是什么，它在于治疗。
But we do not know in what grace consists, which is the object of poetry. 
但我们不知道恩典是什么，而恩典正是诗歌的对象。
"We do not know the natural model which we ought to imitate; and through lack of this knowledge, we have coined fantastic terms, ""The golden age,"" ""The wonder of our times,"" ""Fatal,"" etc., and call this jargon poetical beauty.[13]  But whoever imagines a woman after this model, which consists in saying little things in big words, will see a pretty girl adorned with mirrors and chains, at whom he will smile; because we know better wherein consists the charm of woman than the charm of verse. "
我们不知道我们应该模仿什么自然模式；由于缺乏这方面的知识，我们创造了一些奇妙的术语，“黄金时代”，“我们时代的奇迹”，“致命”等，并将这些行话称为诗意之美。 [13]但是，无论是谁想象一个遵循这种模式的女人，即用大话说小事，他都会看到一个戴着镜子和链子的漂亮女孩，他会对她微笑；因为我们比诗歌的魅力更了解女人的魅力。
"But those who are ignorant would admire her in this dress, and there are many villages in which she would be taken for the queen; hence we call sonnets made after this model ""Village Queens.""   34  No one passes in the world as skilled in verse unless he has put up the sign of a poet, a mathematician, etc. "
但那些无知的人会钦佩她的这件衣服，并且有很多村庄会认为她是女王；因此，我们将按照这种模式创作的十四行诗称为“乡村皇后”。 34 世界上没有人能像诗人、数学家等那样擅长诗歌。
But educated people do not want a sign, and draw little distinction between the trade of a poet and that of an embroiderer. 
但受过教育的人不需要一个标志，并且对诗人和刺绣师的职业没有什么区别。
 People of education are not called poets or mathematicians, etc.; but they are all these, and judges of all these. 
有教养的人不叫诗人、数学家等；但他们就是这一切，也是这一切的审判者。
No one guesses what they are. 
没有人猜出它们是什么。
When they come into society, they talk on matters about which the rest are talking. 
当他们进入社会时，他们谈论其他人正在谈论的事情。
We do not observe in them one quality rather than another, save when they have to make use of it. 
我们不会在他们身上观察到一种品质而不是另一种品质，除非他们必须利用这种品质。
But then we remember it, for it is characteristic of such persons that we do not say of them that they are fine speakers, when it is not a question of oratory, and that we say of them that they are fine speakers, when it is such a question. 
但我们会记住这一点，因为这些人的特点是，当这不是演讲问题时，我们不会说他们是优秀的演讲者，而当涉及演讲的问题时，我们却说他们是优秀的演讲者。这样的问题。
 It is therefore false praise to give a man when we say of him, on his entry, that he is a very clever poet; and it is a bad sign when a man is not asked to give his judgment on some verses. 
因此，当我们在一个人进来时说他是一位非常聪明的诗人时，这是错误的赞美；当一个人没有被要求对某些经文做出判断时，这是一个坏兆头。
"  35  We should not be able to say of a man, ""He is a mathematician,"" or ""a preacher,"" or ""eloquent""; but that he is ""a gentleman."" That universal quality alone pleases me. "
35 我们不应该说一个人“他是数学家”、“传教士”或“雄辩家”；但他是“一位绅士”。仅凭这种普遍的品质就让我高兴。
It is a bad sign when, on seeing a person, you remember his book. 
当你看到一个人时，想起他的书，这是一个不好的征兆。
I would prefer you to see no quality till you meet it and have occasion to use it (_Ne quid nimis_[14]), for fear some one quality prevail and designate the man. 
我希望你在遇到并有机会使用它之前不要看到任何品质（_Ne quid nimis_[14]），因为担心某种品质占上风并指定该人。
Let none think him a fine speaker, unless oratory be in question, and then let them think it. 
除非演讲有问题，否则不要让任何人认为他是一位优秀的演讲者，然后让他们这样认为。
  36  Man is full of wants: he loves only those who can satisfy them all. 
 36、人是充满欲望的：他只爱那些能够满足所有欲望的人。
This one is a good mathematician, one will say. 
有人会说，这是一位优秀的数学家。
But I have nothing to do with mathematics; he would take me for a proposition. 
但我与数学无关；我与数学无关。他会接受我的提议。
That one is a good soldier. He would take me for a besieged town. 
那个人是一名好士兵。他会带我去一座被围困的城镇。
I need, then, an upright man who can accommodate himself generally to all my wants. 
那么，我需要一个正直的人，他能够满足我所有的需要。
  37  [Since we cannot be universal and know all that is to be known of everything, we ought to know a little about everything. 
37【既然我们不可能是普遍的，也无法知道一切事物的一切，所以我们应该对一切事物都了解一点。
For it is far better to know something about everything than to know all about one thing. 
因为对所有事情都了解一些比对一件事了解全部要好得多。
This universality is the best. 
这种普遍性是最好的。
If we can have both, still better; but if we must choose, we ought to choose the former. 
如果我们能两者兼得，那就更好了；但如果我们必须选择，我们应该选择前者。
And the world feels this and does so; for the world is often a good judge.]   38  A poet and not an honest man. 
世界感受到了这一点，也这样做了；因为世界往往是一个好的法官。] 38 一个诗人，而不是一个诚实的人。
  39  If lightning fell on low places, etc., poets, and those who can only reason about things of that kind, would lack proofs. 
 39 如果闪电落在低处等，诗人和那些只能推理此类事物的人将缺乏证据。
  40  If we wished to prove the examples which we take to prove other things, we should have to take those other things to be examples; for, as we always believe the difficulty is in what we wish to prove, we find the examples clearer and a help to demonstration. 
 40 如果我们想证明我们用来证明其他事物的例子，我们就必须以那些其他事物为例；因为，正如我们始终相信困难在于我们想要证明的东西，我们发现这些例子更清晰并且有助于证明。
 Thus when we wish to demonstrate a general theorem, we must give the rule as applied to a particular case; but if we wish to demonstrate a particular case, we must begin with the general rule. 
因此，当我们希望证明一个一般定理时，我们必须给出应用于特定情况的规则；但如果我们想论证一个具体案例，我们就必须从一般规则开始。
For we always find the thing obscure which we wish to prove, and that clear which we use for the proof; for, when a thing is put forward to be proved, we first fill ourselves with the imagination that it is therefore obscure, and on the contrary that what is to prove it is clear, and so we understand it easily. 
因为我们总是发现我们想要证明的事物晦涩难懂，而我们用来证明的事物却很清楚。因为，当一件事被提出来证明时，我们首先充满想象，认为它因此是模糊的，相反，要证明的东西是清楚的，因此我们很容易理解它。
  41  _Epigrams of Martial._--Man loves malice, but not against one-eyed men nor the unfortunate, but against the fortunate and proud. 
 41_武术警句_--人喜爱恶意，但不是针对独眼之人或不幸者，而是针对幸运者和骄傲者。
People are mistaken in thinking otherwise.

 For lust is the source of all our actions, and humanity, etc. 
因为欲望是我们一切行为和人性等的根源。
We must please those who have humane and tender feelings. 
我们必须取悦那些有仁慈和温柔感情的人。
That epigram about two one-eyed people is worthless,[15] for it does not console them, and only gives a point to the author's glory. 
关于两个独眼人的那句警句毫无价值，[15]因为它不能安慰他们，而只能彰显作者的荣耀。
All that is only for the sake of the author is worthless. 
仅仅为了作者的利益而做的一切都是毫无价值的。
"_Ambitiosa recident ornamenta._[16]   42  To call a king ""Prince"" is pleasing, because it diminishes his rank. "

"They resemble middle-class people who have a house of their own, and always have ""My house"" on their tongue. "
他们就像拥有自己的房子的中产阶级，嘴里总是挂着“我的房子”。

他们最好说“我们的书”、“我们的评论”、“我们的历史”等等，因为他们的内容通常比他们自己的更多。

  48  When we find words repeated in a discourse, and, in trying to correct them, discover that they are so appropriate that we would spoil the discourse, we must leave them alone. 
 48 当我们发现某个话语中重复了一些词语，并且在试图纠正它们时，发现它们是如此恰当以至于我们会破坏话语，我们必须不要去管它们。
This is the test; and our attempt is the work of envy, which is blind, and does not see that repetition is not in this place a fault; for there is no general rule. 
这就是测试；我们的尝试是嫉妒的结果，嫉妒是盲目的，看不到重复在这里不是一个错误；因为没有一般规则。
  49  To mask nature and disguise her. 
 49 掩盖自然并伪装她。
No more king, pope, bishop--but _august monarch_, etc.; not Paris--_the capital of the kingdom_. 
不再有国王、教皇、主教——而是_威严的君主_等等；不是巴黎——王国的首都。
There are places in which we ought to call Paris, Paris, and others in which we ought to call it the capital of the kingdom. 
有些地方我们应该称它为巴黎，有些地方我们应该称它为王国的首都。
  50  The same meaning changes with the words which express it. 
 50 同样的含义随着表达它的词语而变化。
Meanings receive their dignity from words instead of giving it to them. 
意义是从词语中获得尊严的，而不是赋予词语的。
Examples should be sought.... 
应该寻找例子......
  51  Sceptic, for obstinate. 
 51 怀疑论，固执。
  52  No one calls another a Cartesian[17] but he who is one himself, a pedant but a pedant, a provincial but a provincial; and I would wager it was the printer who put it on the title of _Letters to a Provincial_. 
52 没有人称另一个人为笛卡尔主义者[17]，只有他自己才是笛卡尔主义者，学究还是学究，外省人还是外省人；我敢打赌，一定是印刷商把这句话写在了《给外省人的信》的标题上。
  53  A carriage _upset_ or _overturned_, according to the meaning _To spread abroad_ or _upset_, according to the meaning. 
 53 一辆马车_打乱_或_翻倒_，根据意思_传播到国外_或_打乱_，根据意思。

57 听到这样的赞美我总是感到不舒服：“我给你带来了很大的麻烦”，“我担心我让你厌烦了”，“我担心这太长了”。我们要么吸引观众，要么激怒他们。

  61  _Order._--I might well have taken this discourse in an order like this: to show the vanity of all conditions of men, to show the vanity of ordinary lives, and then the vanity of philosophic lives, sceptics, stoics; but the order would not have been kept. 
61顺序--我很可能按照这样的顺序来理解这篇演讲：展示人类所有状况的虚荣，展示普通生活的虚荣，然后展示哲学生活、怀疑论者、斯多葛派的虚荣；但订单不会被保留。
I know a little what it is, and how few people understand it. 
我知道一点是什么，但了解它的人却很少。
No human science can keep it. 
任何人类科学都无法保存它。
Saint Thomas[20] did not keep it. 
圣托马斯[20]没有保留它。
Mathematics keep it, but they are useless on account of their depth. 
数学保留了它，但由于其深度而毫无用处。
  62  _Preface to the first part._--To speak of those who have treated of the knowledge of self; of the divisions of Charron,[21] which sadden and weary us; of the confusion of Montaigne;[22] that he was quite aware of his want of method, and shunned it by jumping from subject to subject; that he sought to be fashionable. 
 62_第一部分序言。_--谈论那些对待自我认识的人；卡伦的分裂，[21]这让我们感到悲伤和疲倦；蒙田的困惑；[22]他很清楚自己缺乏方法，并通过从一个主题跳到另一个主题来回避它；他追求时尚。
 His foolish project of describing himself! And this not casually and against his maxims, since every one makes mistakes, but by his maxims themselves, and by first and chief design. 
他描述自己的愚蠢计划！这并不是偶然的，也不是违背他的格言的，因为每个人都会犯错误，而是由他的格言本身，以及最初和主要的设计造成的。
For to say silly things by chance and weakness is a common misfortune; but to say them intentionally is intolerable, and to say such as that ... 
因为偶然和软弱而说出愚蠢的话是一种常见的不幸。但故意这样说是令人无法容忍的，而且这样说......
  63  _Montaigne._--Montaigne's faults are great. 
 63 _Montaigne._--蒙田的缺点很大。
Lewd words; this is bad, notwithstanding Mademoiselle de Gournay.[23] Credulous; _people without eyes_.[24] Ignorant; _squaring the circle,[25] a greater world_.[26] His opinions on suicide, on death.[27] He suggests an indifference about salvation, _without fear and without repentance_.[28] As his book was not written with a religious purpose, he was not bound to mention religion; but it is always our duty not to turn men from it. 
猥亵言语；尽管Mademoiselle de Gournay，这很糟糕。[23]轻信； _没有眼睛的人_。[24]愚昧; _化圆为方，[25]更广阔的世界_。[26]他对自杀、死亡的看法。[27]他暗示对救赎漠不关心，_没有恐惧，没有悔改_。 [28]由于他的书不是出于宗教目的而写的，因此他没有义务提及宗教；但不让人们放弃它始终是我们的责任。
One can excuse his rather free and licentious opinions on some relations of life (730,231)[29]; but one cannot excuse his thoroughly pagan views on death, for a man must renounce piety altogether, if he does not at least wish to die like a Christian. 
人们可以原谅他对某些生活关系的相当自由和放荡的观点（730,231）[29]；但我们不能原谅他对死亡的彻底异教观点，因为一个人如果至少不想像基督徒一样死去，就必须完全放弃虔诚。
Now, through the whole of his book his only conception of death is a cowardly and effeminate one. 
现在，在他的整本书中，他对死亡的唯一看法是一种懦弱和女性化的死亡。
  64  It is not in Montaigne, but in myself, that I find all that I see in him. 
64 我不是在蒙田身上，而是在我自己身上，找到了我在他身上看到的一切。
  65  What good there is in Montaigne can only have been acquired with difficulty. 
 65 蒙田的优点只有通过困难才能获得。
The evil that is in him, I mean apart from his morality, could have been corrected in a moment, if he had been informed that he made too much of trifles and spoke too much of himself. 
我的意思是，除了他的道德之外，如果他被告知他做了太多的小事和太多的自我夸大，那么他内心的邪恶可能会立刻得到纠正。
  66  One must know oneself. 
 66、人必须认识自己。
If this does not serve to discover truth, it at least serves as a rule of life, and there is nothing better. 
如果这不能帮助我们发现真理，那么它至少可以作为一种生活准则，没有比这更好的了。
  67  _The vanity of the sciences._--Physical science will not console me for the ignorance of morality in the time of affliction. 
 67_科学的虚荣。_--物理科学不会安慰我在苦难时期对道德的无知。
But the science of ethics will always console me for the ignorance of the physical sciences. 
但伦理学总是会安慰我对物理科学的无知。
  68  Men are never taught to be gentlemen, and are taught everything else; and they never plume themselves so much on the rest of their knowledge as on knowing how to be gentlemen. 
 68、人从来没有被教导要成为君子，而被教导的是其他一切；他们从来不以自己的其他知识为荣，而以知道如何成为绅士为荣。
They only plume themselves on knowing the one thing they do not know. 
他们只因知道一件他们不知道的事情而自豪。
  69  _The infinites, the mean._--When we read too fast or too slowly, we understand nothing. 
69_无限，平均。_--当我们读得太快或太慢时，我们什么也不懂。
  70  _Nature_ ...--[Nature has set us so well in the centre, that if we change one side of the balance, we change the other also. 
 70 _自然_ ...--[自然将我们置于中心位置，如果我们改变天平的一侧，我们也会改变另一侧。
_I act._ Τά ζῶα τρέχει. 
 _我行动。_ Τά ζῶα τρέχει。
This makes me believe that the springs in our brain are so adjusted that he who touches one touches also its contrary.]   71  Too much and too little wine. 
这让我相信，我们大脑中的弹簧经过如此调节，以至于触摸一个物体的人也触摸到了它的相反物体。] 71 酒太多和太少。
Give him none, he cannot find truth; give him too much, the same. 
不给他任何东西，他就找不到真理；给他太多，一样。
  72  _Man's disproportion._--[This is where our innate knowledge leads us. 
 72 _人的比例失调。_--[这就是我们与生俱来的知识引导我们的地方。
If it be not true, there is no truth in man; and if it be true, he finds therein great cause for humiliation, being compelled to abase himself in one way or another. 
如果它不是真的，那么人就没有真理；如果它不是真的，那么人就没有真理。如果这是真的，他会发现其中有很大的羞辱理由，被迫以某种方式贬低自己。
And since he cannot exist without this knowledge, I wish that, before entering on deeper researches into nature, he would consider her both seriously and at leisure, that he would reflect upon himself also, and knowing what proportion there is....] Let man then contemplate the whole of nature in her full and grand majesty, and turn his vision from the low objects which surround him. 
既然没有这些知识，他就无法存在，我希望，在对自然进行更深入的研究之前，他能认真地、悠闲地考虑一下她，他也能反省一下自己，知道其中的比例……]那么，让人类思考整个自然的完整和宏伟的威严，并将他的视线从他周围的低矮物体上转移开。
Let him gaze on that brilliant light, set like an eternal lamp to illumine the universe; let the earth appear to him a point in comparison with the vast circle described by the sun; and let him wonder at the fact that this vast circle is itself but a very fine point in comparison with that described by the stars in their revolution round the firmament. 
让他凝视那灿烂的光芒，如永恒的明灯一样照亮宇宙；与太阳描绘的巨大圆圈相比，让地球在他看来只是一个点；让他惊叹于这样一个事实：与恒星围绕苍穹公转所描述的圆相比，这个巨大的圆本身不过是一个非常小的点。
But if our view be arrested there, let our imagination pass beyond; it will sooner exhaust the power of conception than nature that of supplying material for conception. 
但如果我们的视野仅限于此，那就让我们的想象力超越吧；与自然提供受孕材料的能力相比，它更快地耗尽了受孕的力量。
The whole visible world is only an imperceptible atom in the ample bosom of nature. 
整个可见世界只是大自然广阔怀抱中一个难以察觉的原子。
No idea approaches it. 
没有想法接近它。
We may enlarge our conceptions beyond all imaginable space; we only produce atoms in comparison with the reality of things. 
我们可以将我们的观念扩大到超出所有可想象的空间；与事物的现实相比，我们只产生原子。
It is an infinite sphere, the centre of which is everywhere, the circumference nowhere.[30] In short it is the greatest sensible mark of the almighty power of God, that imagination loses itself in that thought. 
它是一个无限大的球体，其中心无处不在，圆周却无处可寻。 [30]简而言之，想象力在这种思想中迷失了自己，这是上帝全能力量的最明显的标志。
 Returning to himself, let man consider what he is in comparison with all existence; let him regard himself as lost in this remote corner of nature; and from the little cell in which he finds himself lodged, I mean the universe, let him estimate at their true value the earth, kingdoms, cities, and himself. 
回到自身，让人思考一下，与一切存在相比，自己是什么？让他认为自己迷失在大自然的这个偏远角落；从他发现自己居住的小牢房中，我指的是宇宙，让他评估地球、王国、城市和他自己的真正价值。
What is a man in the Infinite?  But to show him another prodigy equally astonishing, let him examine the most delicate things he knows. 
无限中的人是什么？但为了向他展示另一个同样令人惊叹的神童，让他检查他所知道的最微妙的事情。
Let a mite be given him, with its minute body and parts incomparably more minute, limbs with their joints, veins in the limbs, blood in the veins, humours in the blood, drops in the humours, vapours in the drops. 
给他一只螨虫，它有微小的身体和无比微小的部分，有关节的四肢，四肢上的静脉，静脉中的血液，血液中的体液，体液中的液滴，液滴中的蒸气。
Dividing these last things again, let him exhaust his powers of conception, and let the last object at which he can arrive be now that of our discourse. 
再次划分这些最后的事物，让他耗尽他的构思能力，让他现在能达到的最后一个目标成为我们的话语。
Perhaps he will think that here is the smallest point in nature. 
也许他会认为这里是自然界最小的点。
I will let him see therein a new abyss. 
我会让他在那里看到一个新的深渊。
I will paint for him not only the visible universe, but all that he can conceive of nature's immensity in the womb of this abridged atom. 
我不仅要为他画出可见的宇宙，还要为他画出他在这个精简的原子子宫中所能想象到的自然的浩瀚。
Let him see therein an infinity of universes, each of which has its firmament, its planets, its earth, in the same proportion as in the visible world; in each earth animals, and in the last mites, in which he will find again all that the first had, finding still in these others the same thing without end and without cessation. 
让他在其中看到无限的宇宙，每个宇宙都有其天空、行星、地球，其比例与可见世界相同；在每一种地球动物以及最后的螨虫中，他将再次找到最初拥有的一切，在其他动物中仍然发现同样的东西，没有结束，没有停止。
Let him lose himself in wonders as amazing in their littleness as the others in their vastness. 
让他沉浸在那些微小的奇迹中，就像其他人的巨大奇迹一样令人惊叹。
For who will not be astounded at the fact that our body, which a little while ago was imperceptible in the universe, itself imperceptible in the bosom of the whole, is now a colossus, a world, or rather a whole, in respect of the nothingness which we cannot reach? He who regards himself in this light will be afraid of himself, and observing himself sustained in the body given him by nature between those two abysses of the Infinite and Nothing, will tremble at the sight of these marvels; and I think that, as his curiosity changes into admiration, he will be more disposed to contemplate them in silence than to examine them with presumption. 
因为谁不会对这样一个事实感到惊讶：我们的身体，不久前在宇宙中是不可察觉的，本身在整体的怀抱中也是不可察觉的，现在就宇宙而言，是一个巨人，一个世界，或者更确切地说是一个整体。我们无法达到的虚无？以此角度看待自己的人会害怕自己，并观察自己被自然赋予的身体支撑在无限与虚无的两个深渊之间，他会在看到这些奇迹时颤抖；我认为，当他的好奇心转变为钦佩时，他会更愿意默默地思考它们，而不是带着假设去审视它们。
 For in fact what is man in nature? A Nothing in comparison with the Infinite, an All in comparison with the Nothing, a mean between nothing and everything. 
事实上，人的本质是什么？与无限相比，“无”，与“无”相比，“全”，是“无”与“一切”之间的中庸之道。
Since he is infinitely removed from comprehending the extremes, the end of things and their beginning are hopelessly hidden from him in an impenetrable secret, he is equally incapable of seeing the Nothing from which he was made, and the Infinite in which he is swallowed up. 
由于他对极端的理解是无限遥远的，事物的终结和它们的开始都无可救药地隐藏在一个无法穿透的秘密中，他同样无法看到他被创造的虚无，以及他被吞噬的无限。 。
 What will he do then, but perceive the appearance of the middle of things, in an eternal despair of knowing either their beginning or their end. 
那时他会做什么，除了感知事物中间的表象，永远绝望地知道它们的开始或结束。
All things proceed from the Nothing, and are borne towards the Infinite. 
一切事物都源于无，并走向无限。
Who will follow these marvellous processes? The Author of these wonders understands them. 
谁将遵循这些奇妙的过程？这些奇迹的作者了解它们。
None other can do so. 
没有其他人可以这样做。
 Through failure to contemplate these Infinites, men have rashly rushed into the examination of nature, as though they bore some proportion to her. 
由于未能思考这些无限，人们就仓促地审视自然，就好像他们与自然有某种比例一样。
It is strange that they have wished to understand the beginnings of things, and thence to arrive at the knowledge of the whole, with a presumption as infinite as their object. 
奇怪的是，他们希望了解事物的起源，并由此获得整体的知识，其假设与他们的目标一样无限。
For surely this design cannot be formed without presumption or without a capacity infinite like nature. 
因为毫无疑问，这种设计不可能在没有假设或没有像自然一样无限的能力的情况下形成。
 If we are well informed, we understand that, as nature has graven her image and that of her Author on all things, they almost all partake of her double infinity. 
如果我们消息灵通，我们就会明白，由于大自然在万物上刻下了她的形象和她的作者的形象，它们几乎都分享了她的双重无限。
Thus we see that all the sciences are infinite in the extent of their researches. 
由此可见，所有科学的研究范围都是无限的。
For who doubts that geometry, for instance, has an infinite infinity of problems to solve? They are also infinite in the multitude and fineness of their premises; for it is clear that those which are put forward as ultimate are not self-supporting, but are based on others which, again having others for their support, do not permit of finality. 
例如，谁会怀疑几何学有无数的问题需要解决呢？他们的房屋数量和精美程度也是无限的。因为很明显，那些被提出为终极的东西不是自立的，而是基于其他东西，而这些东西又得到其他人的支持，不允许最终确定。
But we represent some as ultimate for reason, in the same way as in regard to material objects we call that an indivisible point beyond which our senses can no longer perceive anything, although by its nature it is infinitely divisible. 
但我们将某些事物视为终极理性，就像对待物质对象一样，我们将其称为不可分割的点，超过该点我们的感官就无法再感知任何东西，尽管就其本质而言，它是无限可分的。
 Of these two Infinites of science, that of greatness is the most palpable, and hence a few persons have pretended to know all things. 
在科学的这两个无限中，伟大的无限是最明显的，因此少数人假装无所不知。
I will speak of the whole,[31] said Democritus. 
我将谈论整体，[31] 德谟克利特说。
 But the infinitely little is the least obvious. 
但无限小是最不明显的。
Philosophers have much oftener claimed to have reached it, and it is here they have all stumbled. 
哲学家们经常声称已经达到了这一目标，但正是在这里他们都跌倒了。
This has given rise to such common titles as _First Principles_, _Principles of Philosophy_,[32] and the like, as ostentatious in fact, though not in appearance, as that one which blinds us, _De omni scibili_.[33]  We naturally believe ourselves far more capable of reaching the centre of things than of embracing their circumference. 
这就产生了诸如_第一原理_、_哲学原理_等常见标题，[32]等等，尽管表面上看不出来，但事实上却很招摇，就像那个让我们盲目的_Deomni scibili_。 [33]我们自然地相信自己更有能力到达事物的中心，而不是拥抱事物的圆周。
The visible extent of the world visibly exceeds us; but as we exceed little things, we think ourselves more capable of knowing them. 
世界的可见范围明显超出了我们；但当我们超越小事时，我们就会认为自己更有能力了解它们。
And yet we need no less capacity for attaining the Nothing than the All. 
然而，我们获得“无”所需要的能力并不比“万有”所需的能力少。
Infinite capacity is required for both, and it seems to me that whoever shall have understood the ultimate principles of being might also attain to the knowledge of the Infinite. 
两者都需要无限的能力，在我看来，任何人只要理解了存在的终极原则，也就能获得无限的知识。
The one depends on the other, and one leads to the other. 
一者依赖于另一者，一者导致另一者。
These extremes meet and reunite by force of distance, and find each other in God, and in God alone. 
这些极端通过距离的力量相遇并重新结合，并在上帝中找到彼此，而且只在上帝中找到彼此。
 Let us then take our compass; we are something, and we are not everything. 
那么，让我们带上指南针吧；我们是某种东西，但我们不是一切。
The nature of our existence hides from us the knowledge of first beginnings which are born of the Nothing; and the littleness of our being conceals from us the sight of the Infinite. 
我们存在的本质向我们隐藏了从无中诞生的最初开端的知识。我们存在的渺小掩盖了我们对无限的视线。
 Our intellect holds the same position in the world of thought as our body occupies in the expanse of nature. 
我们的智力在思想世界中的地位就像我们的身体在大自然中的地位一样。
 Limited as we are in every way, this state which holds the mean between two extremes is present in all our impotence. 
尽管我们在各方面都受到限制，但这种介于两个极端之间的状态却存在于我们所有的无能之中。
Our senses perceive no extreme. 
我们的感官感知不到极端。
Too much sound deafens us; too much light dazzles us; too great distance or proximity hinders our view. 
太多的声音使我们耳聋；太多的光让我们眼花缭乱；距离太远或太近都会阻碍我们的视野。
Too great length and too great brevity of discourse tend to obscurity; too much truth is paralysing (I know some who cannot understand that to take four from nothing leaves nothing). 
篇幅过大或过于简洁，都会导致晦涩难懂；太多的真相会让人瘫痪（我知道有些人无法理解从无到有的情况下拿走四个就什么也没有了）。
First principles are too self-evident for us; too much pleasure disagrees with us. 
第一原则对我们来说太不言自明了；太多的快乐不适合我们。
Too many concords are annoying in music; too many benefits irritate us; we wish to have the wherewithal to over-pay our debts. 
音乐中太多的和声会让人厌烦。太多的好处让我们恼怒；我们希望有足够的资金来偿还我们的债务。
_Beneficia eo usque læta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse; ubi multum antevenere, pro gratia odium redditur._[34] We feel neither extreme heat nor extreme cold. 
 _Beneficia eo usque læta sunt dum videntur exsolvi posse； ubi multum antevenere, pro gratia odium redditur._[34] 我们既感觉不到极热，也感觉不到极冷。
Excessive qualities are prejudicial to us and not perceptible by the senses; we do not feel but suffer them. 
过多的品质对我们不利，并且无法被感官察觉；我们对它们没有感觉，只是受苦。
Extreme youth and extreme age hinder the mind, as also too much and too little education. 
极端的年轻和极端的年龄阻碍了思想，教育太多和太少也是如此。
In short, extremes are for us as though they were not, and we are not within their notice. 
简而言之，极端对我们来说就好像它们没有一样，我们不在他们的注意范围内。
They escape us, or we them. 
他们逃离了我们，或者我们逃离了他们。
 This is our true state; this is what makes us incapable of certain knowledge and of absolute ignorance. 
这就是我们真实的状态；这就是我们无法获得某些知识和绝对无知的原因。
We sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end. 
我们在一个广阔的球体中航行，永远在不确定性中漂流，从一端驱动到另一端。
When we think to attach ourselves to any point and to fasten to it, it wavers and leaves us; and if we follow it, it eludes our grasp, slips past us, and vanishes for ever. 
当我们想要将自己附着在任何一点上并固定在它上面时，它就会动摇并离开我们；如果我们追随它，它就会逃脱我们的掌控，从我们身边溜走，然后永远消失。
Nothing stays for us. 
没有什么可以为我们留下。
This is our natural condition, and yet most contrary to our inclination; we burn with desire to find solid ground and an ultimate sure foundation whereon to build a tower reaching to the Infinite. 
这是我们的自然状况，但却与我们的倾向背道而驰。我们渴望找到坚实的基础和最终可靠的基础，在其上建造一座通向无限的塔。
But our whole groundwork cracks, and the earth opens to abysses. 
但我们的整个基础都裂开了，大地通向深渊。
 Let us therefore not look for certainty and stability. 
因此，我们不要寻求确定性和稳定性。
Our reason is always deceived by fickle shadows; nothing can fix the finite between the two Infinites, which both enclose and fly from it. 
我们的理智总是被变化无常的阴影所欺骗；没有什么可以修复两个无限之间的有限，它们既包围又飞离它。
 If this be well understood, I think that we shall remain at rest, each in the state wherein nature has placed him. 
如果这一点得到很好的理解，我认为我们将保持静止，每个人都处于自然所赋予他的状态。
As this sphere which has fallen to us as our lot is always distant from either extreme, what matters it that man should have a little more knowledge of the universe? If he has it, he but gets a little higher. 
既然我们命运所降临的这个领域总是远离这两个极端，那么人类对宇宙的了解多一点又有什么关系呢？如果他有的话，他只会更高一点。
Is he not always infinitely removed from the end, and is not the duration of our life equally removed from eternity, even if it lasts ten years longer?  In comparison with these Infinites all finites are equal, and I see no reason for fixing our imagination on one more than on another. 
他不是总是无限地远离终结吗？我们生命的持续时间不是同样远离永恒吗，即使它多持续了十年？与这些无限相比，所有的有限都是平等的，我认为没有理由将我们的想象力更多地集中在一个无限上。
The only comparison which we make of ourselves to the finite is painful to us. 
我们将自己与有限的唯一比较对我们来说是痛苦的。
 If man made himself the first object of study, he would see how incapable he is of going further. 
如果人把自己作为第一个研究对象，他就会发现自己是多么的无能。
How can a part know the whole? But he may perhaps aspire to know at least the parts to which he bears some proportion. 
部分怎么能知道整体呢？但他也许渴望至少了解他所参与的部分。
But the parts of the world are all so related and linked to one another, that I believe it impossible to know one without the other and without the whole. 
但世界的各个部分都是如此相互关联和联系，以至于我相信，如果没有另一个部分，没有整体，就不可能了解其中一个部分。
 Man, for instance, is related to all he knows. 
例如，人与他所知道的一切有关。
He needs a place wherein to abide, time through which to live, motion in order to live, elements to compose him, warmth and food to nourish him, air to breathe. 
他需要一个居住的地方，一个生存的时间，一个为了生存的运动，一个让他平静的元素，一个温暖和食物来滋养他，一个空气来呼吸。
He sees light; he feels bodies; in short, he is in a dependent alliance with everything. 
他看见了光；他感觉到身体；简而言之，他与一切都处于依赖联盟之中。
To know man, then, it is necessary to know how it happens that he needs air to live, and, to know the air, we must know how it is thus related to the life of man, etc. 
那么，要了解人，就必须知道他是如何需要空气来生存的，而要了解空气，我们必须知道它与人的生命有何关系，等等。
Flame cannot exist without air; therefore to understand the one, we must understand the other. 
没有空气，火焰就不可能存在；因此，要了解一个，我们必须了解另一个。
 Since everything then is cause and effect, dependent and supporting, mediate and immediate, and all is held together by a natural though imperceptible chain, which binds together things most distant and most different, I hold it equally impossible to know the parts without knowing the whole, and to know the whole without knowing the parts in detail. 
既然一切都是因果、依赖和支持、中介和直接的，一切都由一条自然但难以察觉的链条连接在一起，这条链条将最遥远和最不同的事物连接在一起，我认为同样不可能在不了解整体的情况下了解各个部分。整体，并且在不了解细节的情况下了解整体。
 [The eternity of things in itself or in God must also astonish our brief duration. 
[事物本身或上帝的永恒性也一定会令我们短暂的生命感到惊讶。
The fixed and constant immobility of nature, in comparison with the continual change which goes on within us, must have the same effect.]  And what completes our incapability of knowing things, is the fact that they are simple, and that we are composed of two opposite natures, different in kind, soul and body. 
与我们内心不断发生的变化相比，自然的固定不变必然具有相同的效果。]而使我们无法了解事物的事实是，它们是简单的，而我们是由两种相反的本性，不同的种类，灵魂和身体。
For it is impossible that our rational part should be other than spiritual; and if any one maintain that we are simply corporeal, this would far more exclude us from the knowledge of things, there being nothing so inconceivable as to say that matter knows itself. 
因为我们的理性部分不可能不属于精神部分。如果有人坚持认为我们只是有形的，那就更将我们排除在对事物的认识之外，没有什么比说物质认识自己更不可思议的了。
It is impossible to imagine how it should know itself. 
无法想象它应该如何认识自己。
 So if we are simply material, we can know nothing at all; and if we are composed of mind and matter, we cannot know perfectly things which are simple, whether spiritual or corporeal. 
因此，如果我们只是物质，我们就什么都不知道；如果我们是由心灵和物质组成的，那么我们就无法完全了解简单的事物，无论是精神的还是物质的。
Hence it comes that almost all philosophers have confused ideas of things, and speak of material things in spiritual terms, and of spiritual things in material terms. 
因此，几乎所有的哲学家对事物的观念都是混乱的，用精神的术语来谈论物质的事物，用物质的术语来谈论精神的事物。
For they say boldly that bodies have a tendency to fall, that they seek after their centre, that they fly from destruction, that they fear the void, that they have inclinations, sympathies, antipathies, all of which attributes pertain only to mind. 
因为他们大胆地说，身体有下落的倾向，他们寻找自己的中心，他们逃离毁灭，他们害怕虚空，他们有倾向、同情、反感，所有这些属性只与心灵有关。
And in speaking of minds, they consider them as in a place, and attribute to them movement from one place to another; and these are qualities which belong only to bodies. 
在谈到心灵时，他们将心灵视为在一个地方，并归因于它们从一个地方到另一个地方的运动；这些是只属于身体的品质。
 Instead of receiving the ideas of these things in their purity, we colour them with our own qualities, and stamp with our composite being all the simple things which we contemplate. 
我们不是接受这些事物的纯粹观念，而是用我们自己的品质给它们着色，并用我们所思考的所有简单事物的复合体来标记。
 Who would not think, seeing us compose all things of mind and body, but that this mixture would be quite intelligible to us? Yet it is the very thing we least understand. 
谁不会想到，看到我们将身心的一切事物组合在一起，但这种混合物对我们来说是相当容易理解的呢？但这正是我们最不理解的事情。
Man is to himself the most wonderful object in nature; for he cannot conceive what the body is, still less what the mind is, and least of all how a body should be united to a mind. 
人对他自己来说是自然界中最奇妙的物体。因为他无法想象身体是什么，更不用说心灵是什么，更不能想象身体应该如何与心灵结合。
This is the consummation of his difficulties, and yet it is his very being. 
这是他的困难的完成，但这就是他的存在。

Let us therefore examine her solutions to problems within her powers. 
因此，让我们来看看她在她的权力范围内解决问题的办法。
If there be anything to which her own interest must have made her apply herself most seriously, it is the inquiry into her own sovereign good. 
如果有什么事情是她自己的利益必须让她最认真地投入的，那就是对她自己主权利益的探究。
Let us see, then, wherein these strong and clear-sighted souls have placed it, and whether they agree. 
那么，让我们看看这些坚强而目光敏锐的灵魂将其置于何处，以及他们是否同意。
 One says that the sovereign good consists in virtue, another in pleasure, another in the knowledge of nature, another in truth, _Felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas_,[36] another in total ignorance, another in indolence, others in disregarding appearances, another in wondering at nothing, _nihil admirari prope res una quæ possit facere et servare beatum_,[37] and the true sceptics in their indifference, doubt, and perpetual suspense, and others, wiser, think to find a better definition. 
有人说至高无上的善在于美德，有人说快乐，有人说自然知识，有人说真理，[36] 另一个人完全无知，另一个人懒惰，其他人不顾外表，另一个人说在对任何事物都感到好奇的过程中，_nihil admirari prope res una quæ possit facere et servarebeatum_，[37] 以及真正的怀疑论者的冷漠、怀疑和永久的悬念，而其他更明智的人则认为找到更好的定义。
We are well satisfied. 
我们很满意。
 _To transpose after the laws to the following title._  We must see if this fine philosophy have gained nothing certain from so long and so intent study; perhaps at least the soul will know itself. 
 _把这些法律换成下面的标题。_我们必须看看这种优秀的哲学是否从这么长时间和如此专注的研究中没有获得任何确定的东西；也许至少灵魂会认识自己。
Let us hear the rulers of the world on this subject. 
让我们听听世界统治者对这个问题的看法。
What have they thought of her substance? 394.[38] Have they been more fortunate in locating her? 395.[39] What have they found out about her origin, duration, and departure? 399.[40]  Is then the soul too noble a subject for their feeble lights? Let us then abase her to matter and see if she knows whereof is made the very body which she animates, and those others which she contemplates and moves at her will. 
他们对她的实质有何看法？ 394.[38]他们找到她是否更幸运？ 395.[39]他们对她的出身、持续时间和离开有何了解？ 399.[40]那么灵魂对于它们微弱的光芒来说是不是太高贵了？那么，让我们将她置于物质之上，看看她是否知道她赋予生命的身体以及她随心所欲地思考和移动的身体是由什么构成的。
What have those great dogmatists, who are ignorant of nothing, known of this matter? _Harum sententiarum_,[41] 393. 
那些一无所知的大教条主义者对此事了解多少？ _Harum Sententiarum_，[41] 393。
 This would doubtless suffice, if reason were reasonable. 
如果理由合理的话，这无疑就足够了。
She is reasonable enough to admit that she has been unable to find anything durable, but she does not yet despair of reaching it; she is as ardent as ever in this search, and is confident she has within her the necessary powers for this conquest. 
她很理智地承认自己一直找不到任何耐用的东西，但她还没有对达到它感到绝望；她还没有放弃。她一如既往地热衷于这种探索，并相信自己拥有实现这一征服所需的力量。

 1，第 4 节。[44] [_概率._--把这个案子降低一个阶段，让它显得荒谬并不困难。
To begin at the very beginning.] What is more absurd than to say that lifeless bodies have passions, fears, hatreds--that insensible bodies, lifeless and incapable of life, have passions which presuppose at least a sensitive soul to feel them, nay more, that the object of their dread is the void? What is there in the void that could make them afraid? Nothing is more shallow and ridiculous. 
从头开始。]还有什么比说无生命的身体有激情、恐惧、仇恨更荒谬的——无知觉的身体，没有生命，没有生命能力，有激情，而这些激情至少需要一个敏感的灵魂来感受它们，不，更重要的是，他们恐惧的对象是虚空？虚空之中，到底有什么能让他们感到恐惧？没有什么比这更肤浅和荒谬的了。
This is not all; it is said that they have in themselves a source of movement to shun the void. 
这还不是全部；据说它们本身就有一种避开虚空的运动源泉。
Have they arms, legs, muscles, nerves?   76  To write against those who made too profound a study of science: Descartes. 
他们有胳膊、腿、肌肉、神经吗？ 76 写反对那些对科学研究过于深刻的人：笛卡尔。
  77  I cannot forgive Descartes. 
 77 我无法原谅笛卡尔。
In all his philosophy he would have been quite willing to dispense with God. 
在他的全部哲学中，他非常愿意放弃上帝。
But he had to make Him give a fillip to set the world in motion; beyond this, he has no further need of God. 
但他必须让上帝给他一点动力，让世界运转起来。除此之外，他不再需要上帝了。
  78  Descartes useless and uncertain. 
 78 笛卡尔无用且不确定。
"  79  [_Descartes._--We must say summarily: ""This is made by figure and motion,"" for it is true. "
 79 [_笛卡尔._--我们必须概括地说：“这是由图形和运动构成的”，因为这是真的。
But to say what these are, and to compose the machine, is ridiculous. 
但要说出这些是什么并组装机器，是荒谬的。
For it is useless, uncertain, and painful. 
因为它是无用的、不确定的、痛苦的。
And were it true, we do not think all philosophy is worth one hour of pain.]   80  How comes it that a cripple does not offend us, but that a fool does?[45] Because a cripple recognises that we walk straight, whereas a fool declares that it is we who are silly; if it were not so, we should feel pity and not anger. 
如果这是真的，我们并不认为所有的哲学都值得一小时的痛苦。] 80 为什么一个跛子不会冒犯我们，而一个傻瓜却会冒犯我们？ [45] 因为一个跛子认识到我们是直走的，而傻瓜宣称我们才是傻瓜；如果不是这样，我们应该感到遗憾而不是愤怒。
" Epictetus[46] asks still more strongly: ""Why are we not angry if we are told that we have a headache, and why are we angry if we are told that we reason badly, or choose wrongly?"" The reason is that we are quite certain that we have not a headache, or are not lame, but we are not so sure that we make a true choice. "
爱比克泰德[46]更强烈地问道：“如果我们被告知我们头痛，为什么我们不生气，而如果我们被告知我们推理错误或选择错误，我们为什么会生气？”原因是我们很确定自己没有头痛，也没有跛脚，但我们不确定自己是否做出了正确的选择。
So having assurance only because we see with our whole sight, it puts us into suspense and surprise when another with his whole sight sees the opposite, and still more so when a thousand others deride our choice. 
因此，我们之所以有把握，只是因为我们用我们的整个视野看到了，当另一个人用他的整个视野看到相反的情况时，这会让我们陷入悬念和惊讶，当一千个其他人嘲笑我们的选择时更是如此。
For we must prefer our own lights to those of so many others, and that is bold and difficult. 
因为我们必须更喜欢我们自己的光，而不是许多其他人的光，这是大胆而困难的。
There is never this contradiction in the feelings towards a cripple. 
对残疾人的感情从来不存在这种矛盾。
  81  It is natural for the mind to believe, and for the will to love;[47] so that, for want of true objects, they must attach themselves to false. 
 81心灵相信是自然的，爱的意愿也是自然的；[47]因此，由于缺乏真实的对象，他们必须依附于虚假的对象。
  82  _Imagination._[48]--It is that deceitful part in man, that mistress of error and falsity, the more deceptive that she is not always so; for she would be an infallible rule of truth, if she were an infallible rule of falsehood. 
 82_想象力。_[48]--这就是人身上的欺骗性部分，是错误和虚假的情妇，她越不总是如此，就越具有欺骗性；因为如果她是一条绝对正确的谎言法则，那么她也将是一条绝对正确的真理法则。
But being most generally false, she gives no sign of her nature, impressing the same character on the true and the false. 
但她的性格大多是虚假的，没有表现出她的本性，真实的和虚假的都给人留下了同样的印象。
 I do not speak of fools, I speak of the wisest men; and it is among them that the imagination has the great gift of persuasion. 
我不是在谈论愚人，我是在谈论最聪明的人；其中，想象力具有说服力的伟大天赋。
Reason protests in vain; it cannot set a true value on things. 
理性抗议是徒劳的；它无法为事物设定真正的价值。
 This arrogant power, the enemy of reason, who likes to rule and dominate it, has established in man a second nature to show how all-powerful she is. 
这种傲慢的力量，是理性的敌人，喜欢统治和主宰理性，它在人类身上建立了第二天性，以显示她是多么全能。
She makes men happy and sad, healthy and sick, rich and poor; she compels reason to believe, doubt, and deny; she blunts the senses, or quickens them; she has her fools and sages; and nothing vexes us more than to see that she fills her devotees with a satisfaction far more full and entire than does reason. 
她使男人快乐和悲伤，健康和疾病，富有和贫穷；她迫使人们有理由去相信、怀疑和否认；她使感觉迟钝，或使感觉加快；她有她的傻瓜和圣人；没有什么比看到她给她的信徒带来比理性更充分和完整的满足更让我们烦恼的了。
Those who have a lively imagination are a great deal more pleased with themselves than the wise can reasonably be. 
那些拥有丰富想象力的人比智者更容易对自己感到满意。
They look down upon men with haughtiness; they argue with boldness and confidence, others with fear and diffidence; and this gaiety of countenance often gives them the advantage in the opinion of the hearers, such favour have the imaginary wise in the eyes of judges of like nature. 
他们傲慢地瞧不起人；他们的争论充满勇气和自信，其他人的争论则充满恐惧和胆怯；这种愉快的表情常常使他们在听众的心目中占据优势，在类似性质的法官眼中，想象中的智者也会得到这样的青睐。
Imagination cannot make fools wise; but she can make them happy, to the envy of reason which can only make its friends miserable; the one covers them with glory, the other with shame. 
想象力不能使愚人变得聪明；但她却能让他们快乐，这让理性羡慕不已，理性只能让朋友们痛苦不堪。一个人用荣耀遮盖他们，另一个人用羞辱遮盖他们。
 What but this faculty of imagination dispenses reputation, awards respect and veneration to persons, works, laws, and the great? How insufficient are all the riches of the earth without her consent!  Would you not say that this magistrate, whose venerable age commands the respect of a whole people, is governed by pure and lofty reason, and that he judges causes according to their true nature without considering those mere trifles which only affect the imagination of the weak? See him go to sermon, full of devout zeal, strengthening his reason with the ardour of his love. 
除了这种想象力之外，还有什么能赋予人、作品、法律和伟人声誉、给予尊重和崇敬呢？如果没有她的同意，地球上所有的财富是多么不足啊！难道你不说，这位令人尊敬的长官，他的年事已高，受到全国人民的尊敬，他是由纯洁而崇高的理性统治的，他根据事情的真实性质来判断事情，而不考虑那些只会影响弱者想象力的琐事。 ？看他去布道，充满虔诚的热情，用他的爱的热情强化他的理性。
He is ready to listen with exemplary respect. 
他愿意以堪称典范的尊重来倾听。
Let the preacher appear, and let nature have given him a hoarse voice or a comical cast of countenance, or let his barber have given him a bad shave, or let by chance his dress be more dirtied than usual, then however great the truths he announces. 
让传道人出现，让自然赋予他嘶哑的声音或滑稽的表情，或者让他的理发师给他刮胡子，或者让他的衣服偶然比平常更脏，那么无论他所讲的真理有多么伟大，宣布。
I wager our senator loses his gravity. 
我敢打赌我们的参议员失去了他的重力。
 If the greatest philosopher in the world find himself upon a plank wider than actually necessary, but hanging over a precipice, his imagination will prevail, though his reason convince him of his safety.[49] Many cannot bear the thought without a cold sweat. 
如果世界上最伟大的哲学家发现自己站在比实际需要更宽的木板上，但悬在悬崖上，他的想象力将会占上风，尽管他的理性使他相信自己是安全的。 [49]很多人一想到这个就忍不住冒冷汗。
I will not state all its effects.

The tone of voice affects the wisest, and changes the force of a discourse or a poem. 
语气影响最聪明的人，并改变话语或诗歌的力量。
 Love or hate alters the aspect of justice. 
爱或恨改变了正义的面貌。
How much greater confidence has an advocate, retained with a large fee, in the justice of his cause! How much better does his bold manner make his case appear to the judges, deceived as they are by appearances! How ludicrous is reason, blown with a breath in every direction!  I should have to enumerate almost every action of men who scarce waver save under her assaults. 
一位律师在缴纳大笔费用后，对其事业的正义性有多大的信心！他大胆的举止让法官们看到了他的案子，因为他们被外表所欺骗了！理性是多么可笑啊，它被一股气息吹向四面八方！我必须列举几乎所有男人的每一个举动，除了在她的攻击下，他们几乎没有动摇。
For reason has been obliged to yield, and the wisest reason takes as her own principles those which the imagination of man has everywhere rashly introduced. 
因为理性不得不屈服，而最明智的理性则将人类的想象力随处鲁莽引入的那些原则视为自己的原则。
[He who would follow reason only would be deemed foolish by the generality of men. 
 [只遵循理性的人会被普遍认为是愚蠢的。
We must judge by the opinion of the majority of mankind. 
我们必须根据大多数人的意见来做出判断。
Because it has pleased them, we must work all day for pleasures seen to be imaginary; and after sleep has refreshed our tired reason, we must forthwith start up and rush after phantoms, and suffer the impressions of this mistress of the world. 
因为这让他们高兴，所以我们必须整天工作，以获得看似虚幻的快乐。当睡眠恢复了我们疲惫的理智之后，我们必须立即开始追寻幻象，并承受这个世界女主人的印象。
This is one of the sources of error, but it is not the only one.]  Our magistrates have known well this mystery. 
这是错误的来源之一，但不是唯一的来源。]我们的地方官员深知这个谜团。
Their red robes, the ermine in which they wrap themselves like furry cats,[50] the courts in which they administer justice, the _fleurs-de-lis_, and all such august apparel were necessary; if the physicians had not their cassocks and their mules, if the doctors had not their square caps and their robes four times too wide, they would never have duped the world, which cannot resist so original an appearance. 
他们的红色长袍，他们像毛茸茸的猫一样包裹自己的貂皮，[50]他们主持正义的法庭，百合花，以及所有这些庄严的服装都是必要的;如果医生们没有他们的袈裟和骡子，如果医生们没有他们的方帽和宽四倍的长袍，他们就永远不会欺骗世界，世界无法抗拒如此原始的外表。
If magistrates had true justice, and if physicians had the true art of healing, they would have no occasion for square caps; the majesty of these sciences would of itself be venerable enough. 
如果地方法官有真正的正义，如果医生有真正的治疗艺术，他们就没有必要戴方帽；这些科学的威严本身就足够令人尊敬了。
But having only imaginary knowledge, they must employ those silly tools that strike the imagination with which they have to deal; and thereby in fact they inspire respect. 
但他们只有想象中的知识，必须使用那些愚蠢的工具来激发他们的想象力。因此，事实上他们激发了尊重。
Soldiers alone are not disguised in this manner, because indeed their part is the most essential; they establish themselves by force, the others by show. 
仅士兵不会以这种方式伪装，因为他们的角色确实是最重要的。他们通过武力来确立自己的地位，而其他人则通过表演来确立自己的地位。
 Therefore our kings seek out no disguises. 
因此，我们的国王不寻求任何伪装。
They do not mask themselves in extraordinary costumes to appear such; but they are accompanied by guards and halberdiers. 
他们不会用非凡的服装来掩盖自己，而是为了让自己看起来如此。但他们有卫兵和戟兵随行。
Those armed and red-faced puppets who have hands and power for them alone, those trumpets and drums which go before them, and those legions round about them, make the stoutest tremble. 
那些全副武装、红脸的傀儡，他们的双手和力量只属于他们，那些走在他们前面的号角和鼓，以及那些围绕在他们周围的军团，让最坚强的人都颤抖。
They have not dress only, they have might. 
他们不仅有衣着，还有力量。
A very refined reason is required to regard as an ordinary man the Grand Turk, in his superb seraglio, surrounded by forty thousand janissaries. 
需要一个非常精致的理由才能将大土耳其人视为一个普通人，他穿着华丽的后宫，周围有四万名禁卫军。
 We cannot even see an advocate in his robe and with his cap on his head, without a favourable opinion of his ability. 
我们甚至不能看到一位身穿长袍、头戴帽子的辩护律师，而不会对他的能力不抱有好感。
The imagination disposes of everything; it makes beauty, justice, and happiness, which is everything in the world. 
想象力决定一切；它创造了美丽、正义和幸福，这就是世界上的一切。
I should much like to see an Italian work, of which I only know the title, which alone is worth many books, _Della opinione regina del mondo_.[51] I approve of the book without knowing it, save the evil in it, if any. 
我很想看一部意大利作品，我只知道它的书名，光是它就值得读很多书了，_Della Opinione regina del mondo_。[51]我在不知不觉中批准了这本书，保留其中的邪恶之处，如果有的话。
These are pretty much the effects of that deceptive faculty, which seems to have been expressly given us to lead us into necessary error. 
这些几乎都是欺骗性能力的影响，这种能力似乎是明确赋予我们的，目的是引导我们犯下必要的错误。
We have, however, many other sources of error. 
然而，我们还有许多其他的错误来源。
 Not only are old impressions capable of misleading us; the charms of novelty have the same power. 
旧的印象不仅会误导我们，而且还会误导我们。新奇的魅力也具有同样的力量。
Hence arise all the disputes of men, who taunt each other either with following the false impressions of childhood or with running rashly after the new.

There is no principle, however natural to us from infancy, which may not be made to pass for a false impression either of education or of sense.

" ""Because,"" say some, ""you have believed from childhood that a box was empty when you saw nothing in it, you have believed in the possibility of a vacuum. "
一些人说：“因为你从小就相信，当你看到盒子里什么都没有时，它就是空的，你相信真空的可能性。
"This is an illusion of your senses, strengthened by custom, which science must correct."" ""Because,"" say others, ""you have been taught at school that there is no vacuum, you have perverted your common sense which clearly comprehended it, and you must correct this by returning to your first state."" Which has deceived you, your senses or your education?  We have another source of error in diseases.[52] They spoil the judgment and the senses; and if the more serious produce a sensible change, I do not doubt that slighter ills produce a proportionate impression. "
这是你的感官错觉，被习惯强化了，科学必须纠正它。”“因为，”其他人说，“因为你在学校里被教导不存在真空，你扭曲了你清楚理解它的常识，并且你必须回到你的第一个状态来纠正这个问题。”你的感官或你的教育哪一个欺骗了你？我们还有疾病中的另一个错误来源。[52]它们会破坏判断力和感官；如果更严重的情况会产生一种明智的改变，我毫不怀疑轻微的毛病会产生相应的印象。
 Our own interest is again a marvellous instrument for nicely putting out our eyes.

The sure way of losing a just cause has been to get it recommended to these men by their near relatives.

 Justice and truth are two such subtle points, that our tools are too blunt to touch them accurately. 
正义和真理是两个如此微妙的点，我们的工具太钝了，无法准确地触及它们。
If they reach the point, they either crush it, or lean all round, more on the false than on the true.

 84、想象力放大了小物体，使我们的灵魂充满了奇妙的估计；而且，它以鲁莽的傲慢态度贬低伟人，就像谈论上帝一样。
  85  Things which have most hold on us, as the concealment of our few possessions, are often a mere nothing.

 92 除了习惯原则之外，我们的自然原则还有哪些？对于儿童来说，这些习惯是从父亲的习惯中继承下来的，就像动物的狩猎习惯一样。
A different custom will cause different natural principles. 
不同的风俗习惯，就会造成不同的自然法则。
This is seen in experience; and if there are some natural principles ineradicable by custom, there are also some customs opposed to nature, ineradicable by nature, or by a second custom. 
这是从经验中可以看出的；如果说有一些自然原则是无法通过习惯消除的，那么也有一些与自然相反的习惯是无法通过自然或第二种习惯消除的。
This depends on disposition. 
这个要看性格。
  93  Parents fear lest the natural love of their children may fade away. 
93 父母担心孩子天生的爱会消失。
What kind of nature is that which is subject to decay? Custom is a second nature which destroys the former.[58] But what is nature? For is custom not natural? I am much afraid that nature is itself only a first custom, as custom is a second nature. 
什么样的自然是会腐朽的呢？习俗是第二天性，它摧毁了前者。 [58]但什么是自然呢？因为习惯不是自然的吗？我很担心自然本身只是第一习惯，因为习惯是第二天性。
  94  The nature of man is wholly natural, _omne animal_.[59]  There is nothing he may not make natural; there is nothing natural he may not lose. 
 94 人的本性是完全自然的，_所有动物_。[59]没有什么是他不能使之变得自然的；没有什么是他不能失去的。
  95  Memory, joy, are intuitions; and even mathematical propositions become intuitions, for education produces natural intuitions, and natural intuitions are erased by education. 
 95、记忆、欢乐，都是直觉；甚至数学命题也变成了直觉，因为教育产生了自然直觉，而自然直觉又被教育抹去了。
  96  When we are accustomed to use bad reasons for proving natural effects, we are not willing to receive good reasons when they are discovered. 
 96 当我们习惯于用不好的理由来证明自然效应时，当好的理由被发现时，我们就不愿意接受。
An example may be given from the circulation of the blood as a reason why the vein swells below the ligature. 
可以从血液循环中给出一个例子，作为静脉在结扎线下方肿胀的原因。
  97  The most important affair in life is the choice of a calling; chance decides it. 
97 人生最重要的事情是选择职业；机会决定它。
Custom makes men masons, soldiers, slaters. 
习俗使人成为石匠、士兵、瓦工。
"He is a good slater, says one, and, speaking of soldiers, remarks, ""They are perfect fools."" But others affirm, ""There is nothing great but war, the rest of men are good for nothing."" We choose our callings according as we hear this or that praised or despised in our childhood, for we naturally love truth and hate folly. "
有人说，他是一名出色的打手，而在谈到士兵时，他说：“他们都是十足的傻瓜。”但也有人断言：“除了战争，没有什么伟大的事情，其他人一无是处。”我们根据童年时所听到的赞扬或蔑视来选择自己的职业，因为我们天生热爱真理，讨厌愚蠢。
These words move us; the only error is in their application. 
这些话让我们感动；唯一的错误在于他们的应用程序。
So great is the force of custom that out of those whom nature has only made men, are created all conditions of men. 
习俗的力量如此之大，以至于大自然只创造了人类，人类的所有条件也被创造出来。
For some districts are full of masons, others of soldiers, etc. 
因为有些地区充满了石匠，其他地区则充满了士兵，等等。
Certainly nature is not so uniform. 
当然，大自然并不是那么统一。
It is custom then which does this, for it constrains nature. 
那么这是习惯造成的，因为它限制了自然。
But sometimes nature gains the ascendancy, and preserves man's instinct, in spite of all custom, good or bad. 
但有时，自然会占上风，并保留人的本能，不管习惯是好还是坏。
  98  _Bias leading to error._--It is a deplorable thing to see all men deliberating on means alone, and not on the end. 
98_偏见导致错误。_--看到所有人只考虑手段而不考虑结果，这是一件可悲的事情。
Each thinks how he will acquit himself in his condition; but as for the choice of condition, or of country, chance gives them to us. 
每个人都在想，在自己的情况下，他将如何表现自己的清白。但至于选择条件或国家，机会就交给我们了。
 It is a pitiable thing to see so many Turks, heretics, and infidels follow the way of their fathers for the sole reason that each has been imbued with the prejudice that it is the best. 
看到如此多的土耳其人、异教徒和异教徒追随他们祖先的道路，这是一件可怜的事情，唯一的原因是每个人都被灌输了一种偏见，认为这是最好的。
And that fixes for each man his conditions of locksmith, soldier, etc. 
这就决定了每个人的锁匠、士兵等条件。
 Hence savages care nothing for Providence.[60]   99  There is an universal and essential difference between the actions of the will and all other actions. 
因此，野蛮人并不关心普罗维登斯。[60] 99 意志行动与所有其他行动之间存在着普遍而本质的区别。
 The will is one of the chief factors in belief, not that it creates belief, but because things are true or false according to the aspect in which we look at them. 
意志是信仰的主要因素之一，并不是说它创造了信仰，而是因为事物是真是假，取决于我们看待它们的角度。
The will, which prefers one aspect to another, turns away the mind from considering the qualities of all that it does not like to see; and thus the mind, moving in accord with the will, stops to consider the aspect which it likes, and so judges by what it sees. 
意志偏爱某一方面而不是另一方面，它使心灵不再考虑所有它不喜欢看到的事物的品质。因此，心随着意志而移动，停止考虑它喜欢的方面，并根据它所看到的进行判断。
  100  _Self-love._--The nature of self-love and of this human Ego is to love self only and consider self only. 
 100 _自爱._--自爱和人类自我的本质是只爱自己，只考虑自己。
But what will man do? He cannot prevent this object that he loves from being full of faults and wants. 
但人会做什么呢？他无法阻止他所爱的这个对象充满缺点和欲望。
He wants to be great, and he sees himself small. 
他想成为伟大的人，但他却认为自己很渺小。
He wants to be happy, and he sees himself miserable. 
他想要快乐，却发现自己很痛苦。
He wants to be perfect, and he sees himself full of imperfections. 
他想要完美，却发现自己充满了缺陷。
He wants to be the object of love and esteem among men, and he sees that his faults merit only their hatred and contempt. 
他希望成为人们爱戴和尊重的对象，但他发现自己的缺点只会招致人们的仇恨和蔑视。
This embarrassment in which he finds himself produces in him the most unrighteous and criminal passion that can be imagined; for he conceives a mortal enmity against that truth which reproves him, and which convinces him of his faults. 
他发现自己陷入了这种尴尬的境地，这在他心中产生了可以想象的最不正义和犯罪的激情。因为他对责备他、使他承认自己的错误的真理抱有致命的敌意。
He would annihilate it, but, unable to destroy it in its essence, he destroys it as far as possible in his own knowledge and in that of others; that is to say, he devotes all his attention to hiding his faults both from others and from himself, and he cannot endure either that others should point them out to him, or that they should see them. 
他想要消灭它，但是，由于无法从本质上消灭它，所以他在自己和他人的知识中尽可能地消灭它。也就是说，他把所有的注意力都集中在向他人和自己隐瞒自己的错误，他既不能忍受别人向他指出错误，也不能忍受别人看到错误。
 Truly it is an evil to be full of faults; but it is a still greater evil to be full of them, and to be unwilling to recognise them, since that is to add the further fault of a voluntary illusion. 
确实，充满过失是一种罪恶；但是，如果充满了这些想法，却又不愿意承认它们，那就是更大的罪恶了，因为这会增加自愿幻觉的进一步错误。
We do not like others to deceive us; we do not think it fair that they should be held in higher esteem by us than they deserve; it is not then fair that we should deceive them, and should wish them to esteem us more highly than we deserve. 
我们不喜欢别人欺骗我们；我们认为我们给予他们比他们应得的更高的尊重是不公平的；如果我们欺骗他们，并希望他们对我们的尊重高于我们应得的，那是不公平的。
 Thus, when they discover only the imperfections and vices which we really have, it is plain they do us no wrong, since it is not they who cause them; they rather do us good, since they help us to free ourselves from an evil, namely, the ignorance of these imperfections. 
因此，当他们只发现我们真正拥有的不完美和恶习时，很明显他们并没有对我们做错事，因为不是他们造成了这些缺陷和恶习；而是他们造成了我们的不完美和恶习。相反，它们对我们有好处，因为它们帮助我们摆脱邪恶，即对这些缺陷的无知。
We ought not to be angry at their knowing our faults and despising us; it is but right that they should know us for what we are, and should despise us, if we are contemptible. 
我们不应该因为他们知道我们的错误而轻视我们而生气；他们应该了解我们的本来面目，如果我们卑鄙，他们就应该鄙视我们，这是正确的。
 Such are the feelings that would arise in a heart full of equity and justice. 
这就是一颗充满公平正义的心所产生的感受。
What must we say then of our own heart, when we see in it a wholly different disposition? For is it not true that we hate truth and those who tell it us, and that we like them to be deceived in our favour, and prefer to be esteemed by them as being other than what we are in fact? One proof of this makes me shudder. 
当我们看到自己的内心有完全不同的性情时，我们该怎么说呢？难道我们不是真的讨厌真理和那些告诉我们真理的人，我们喜欢他们为了我们的利益而受欺骗，并且更愿意被他们视为与我们事实不同的人吗？这一点的一个证据让我不寒而栗。
The Catholic religion does not bind us to confess our sins indiscriminately to everybody; it allows them to remain hidden from all other men save one, to whom she bids us reveal the innermost recesses of our heart, and show ourselves as we are. 
天主教并不要求我们不分青红皂白地向所有人认罪；它使她们能够对除了一个人之外的所有其他男人保持隐藏，她要求我们向他们揭示我们内心最深处的秘密，并展示我们自己的本来面目。
There is only this one man in the world whom she orders us to undeceive, and she binds him to an inviolable secrecy, which makes this knowledge to him as if it were not. 
世界上只有这个人，她命令我们不要欺骗他，她把他束缚在一种不可侵犯的秘密中，这使得他对这一知识仿佛不存在一样。
Can we imagine anything more charitable and pleasant? And yet the corruption of man is such that he finds even this law harsh; and it is one of the main reasons which has caused a great part of Europe to rebel against the Church.[61]  How unjust and unreasonable is the heart of man, which feels it disagreeable to be obliged to do in regard to one man what in some measure it were right to do to all men! For is it right that we should deceive men?  There are different degrees in this aversion to truth; but all may perhaps be said to have it in some degree, because it is inseparable from self-love. 
我们还能想象还有什么比这更仁慈和令人愉快的事情吗？然而，人的败坏是如此严重，以至于他甚至觉得这条法律很严厉。这是导致欧洲大部分地区反抗教会的主要原因之一。 [61]人的内心是多么不公正和不合理啊，因为在某种程度上，对所有人都应该做的事，而对一个人做却是一件令人不快的事情！因为我们应该欺骗人吗？这种对真理的厌恶有不同程度。但也许可以说所有人都在某种程度上拥有它，因为它与自爱密不可分。
It is this false delicacy which makes those who are under the necessity of reproving others choose so many windings and middle courses to avoid offence. 
正是这种虚假的微妙，使得那些需要责备他人的人选择了许多曲折和中庸的做法来避免冒犯。
They must lessen our faults, appear to excuse them, intersperse praises and evidence of love and esteem. 
他们必须减少我们的过失，似乎在原谅我们的过失，并穿插赞美和爱与尊重的证据。
Despite all this, the medicine does not cease to be bitter to self-love. 
尽管如此，这剂药并没有停止对自爱产生苦涩。
It takes as little as it can, always with disgust, and often with a secret spite against those who administer it. 
它需要尽可能少的东西，总是带着厌恶，并且常常对那些管理它的人怀有秘密的怨恨。
 Hence it happens that if any have some interest in being loved by us, they are averse to render us a service which they know to be disagreeable. 
因此，如果有人有兴趣被我们所爱，他们就会不愿意为我们提供他们知道不愉快的服务。
They treat us as we wish to be treated. 
他们对待我们就像我们希望被对待一样。
We hate the truth, and they hide it from us. 
我们讨厌真相，而他们却向我们隐瞒真相。
We desire flattery, and they flatter us. 
我们渴望阿谀奉承，他们也奉承我们。
We like to be deceived, and they deceive us. 
我们喜欢被欺骗，他们也欺骗我们。
 So each degree of good fortune which raises us in the world removes us farther from truth, because we are most afraid of wounding those whose affection is most useful and whose dislike is most dangerous. 
因此，我们在世界上的每一次好运都会使我们远离真理，因为我们最害怕伤害那些感情最有用、厌恶最危险的人。
A prince may be the byword of all Europe, and he alone will know nothing of it. 
王子可能是整个欧洲的代名词，但只有他一个人对此一无所知。
I am not astonished. 
我并不感到惊讶。
To tell the truth is useful to those to whom it is spoken, but disadvantageous to those who tell it, because it makes them disliked. 
说实话对那些说真话的人来说是有用的，但对那些说真话的人来说却是不利的，因为这会让他们不受欢迎。
Now those who live with princes love their own interests more than that of the prince whom they serve; and so they take care not to confer on him a benefit so as to injure themselves. 
现在那些与君主同住的人，只顾自己的利益，而不是所侍奉的君主的利益。因此，他们小心翼翼地不要给予他好处，以免伤害自己。
 This evil is no doubt greater and more common among the higher classes; but the lower are not exempt from it, since there is always some advantage in making men love us. 
这种罪恶无疑在上层阶级中更为严重和普遍。但下层阶级也不能幸免，因为让男人爱我们总有一些好处。
Human life is thus only a perpetual illusion; men deceive and flatter each other. 
因此，人类的生命只是一个永恒的幻象；人们互相欺骗，互相奉承。
No one speaks of us in our presence as he does of us in our absence. 
没有人在我们在场时谈论我们，就像在我们不在场时谈论我们一样。
Human society is founded on mutual deceit; few friendships would endure if each knew what his friend said of him in his absence, although he then spoke in sincerity and without passion. 
人类社会是建立在相互欺骗的基础上的；如果每个人都知道他的朋友在他不在的时候对他说了些什么，那么友谊就不会持久，尽管他当时说话是真诚的，没有激情。
 Man is then only disguise, falsehood, and hypocrisy, both in himself and in regard to others. 
那么，人无论对于自己还是对于他人来说都只是伪装、谎言和虚伪。
He does not wish any one to tell him the truth; he avoids telling it to others, and all these dispositions, so removed from justice and reason, have a natural root in his heart. 
他不希望任何人告诉他真相；他避免告诉别人，而所有这些远离正义和理性的性格，在他的心里自然而然地扎根了。
  101  I set it down as a fact that if all men knew what each said of the other, there would not be four friends in the world. 
101 我把它作为一个事实：如果所有人都知道彼此的言论，那么世界上就不会有四个朋友了。
This is apparent from the quarrels which arise from the indiscreet tales told from time to time. 
这一点从不时流传的轻率故事所引起的争吵中可以明显看出。
[I say, further, all men would be ...]   102  Some vices only lay hold of us by means of others, and these, like branches, fall on removal of the trunk. 
 [我进一步说，所有人都会……] 102 有些恶习只能通过其他恶习来控制我们，而这些恶习就像树枝一样，随着树干的移除而掉落。
  103  The example of Alexander's chastity[62] has not made so many continent as that of his drunkenness has made intemperate. 
 103 亚历山大的贞洁[62] 的榜样并没有像他的酗酒使人节制那样使许多人保持克制。
It is not shameful not to be as virtuous as he, and it seems excusable to be no more vicious. 
不像他那样贤惠并不可耻，不再像他那样恶毒似乎也情有可原。
We do not believe ourselves to be exactly sharing in the vices of the vulgar, when we see that we are sharing in those of great men; and yet we do not observe that in these matters they are ordinary men. 
当我们发现自己也犯了伟人的恶习时，我们并不认为自己确实犯了庸俗的恶习。然而我们并没有观察到在这些问题上他们是普通人。
We hold on to them by the same end by which they hold on to the rabble; for, however exalted they are, they are still united at some point to the lowest of men. 
我们抓住他们的目的与他们抓住乌合之众的目的是一样的。因为，无论他们多么崇高，他们在某些时候仍然与最低等的人团结在一起。
They are not suspended in the air, quite removed from our society. 
他们并不是悬浮在空中，完全脱离了我们的社会。
No, no; if they are greater than we, it is because their heads are higher; but their feet are as low as ours. 
不，不;如果他们比我们伟大，那是因为他们的头比我们高；但他们的脚和我们的一样低。
They are all on the same level, and rest on the same earth; and by that extremity they are as low as we are, as the meanest folk, as infants, and as the beasts. 
他们都在同一水平线上，都在同一个地球上；就这一点而言，他们和我们一样卑微，就像最卑鄙的人、婴儿和野兽一样。
  104  When our passion leads us to do something, we forget our duty; for example, we like a book and read it, when we ought to be doing something else. 
 104 当我们的热情驱使我们去做某事时，我们就忘记了我们的责任；例如，当我们应该做其他事情时，我们喜欢一本书并阅读它。
Now, to remind ourselves of our duty, we must set ourselves a task we dislike; we then plead that we have something else to do, and by this means remember our duty. 
现在，为了提醒自己我们的责任，我们必须给自己设定一个我们不喜欢的任务；然后我们恳求我们还有其他事情要做，并通过这种方式记住我们的职责。
"  105  How difficult it is to submit anything to the judgment of another, without prejudicing his judgment by the manner in which we submit it! If we say, ""I think it beautiful,"" ""I think it obscure,"" or the like, we either entice the imagination into that view, or irritate it to the contrary. "
 105 将任何事物提交给他人判断，而又不因我们提交事物的方式而影响他的判断，这是多么困难啊！如果我们说，“我认为它很美”，“我认为它晦涩难懂”，或者诸如此类的话，我们要么会吸引想象力进入那种观点，要么会激怒它，使其产生相反的观点。
It is better to say nothing; and then the other judges according to what really is, that is to say, according as it then is, and according as the other circumstances, not of our making, have placed it. 
最好什么也不说；然后，其他人根据真实情况进行判断，也就是说，根据当时的情况，并根据其他情况（而不是我们造成的）所放置的情况。
But we at least shall have added nothing, unless it be that silence also produces an effect, according to the turn and the interpretation which the other will be disposed to give it, or as he will guess it from gestures or countenance, or from the tone of the voice, if he is a physiognomist. 
但我们至少不会添加任何东西，除非沉默也会产生一种效果，根据对方的态度和解释，或者根据他从手势或表情或从表情中猜测的那样。语气，如果他是相术师的话。
So difficult is it not to upset a judgment from its natural place, or, rather, so rarely is it firm and stable!   106  By knowing each man's ruling passion, we are sure of pleasing him; and yet each has his fancies, opposed to his true good, in the very idea which he has of the good. 
不颠覆自然的判断是多么困难，或者更确切地说，它很少是坚定和稳定的！ 106、通过了解每个人的主要激情，我们一定能取悦他；然而，每个人都有自己的幻想，与他真正的善相反，在他对善的想法中。
It is a singularly puzzling fact. 
这是一个令人费解的事实。
  107  _Lustravit lampade terras._[63]--The weather and my mood have little connection. 
 107 _Lustravit lampade terras._[63]--天气和我的心情没什么关系。
I have my foggy and my fine days within me; my prosperity or misfortune has little to do with the matter. 
我的内心有阴暗的日子和美好的日子；我的繁荣或不幸与此事无关。
I sometimes struggle against luck, the glory of mastering it makes me master it gaily; whereas I am sometimes surfeited in the midst of good fortune. 
有时我会与运气作斗争，掌握它的荣耀使我愉快地掌握它；而我有时却因好运而得意忘形。
  108  Although people may have no interest in what they are saying, we must not absolutely conclude from this that they are not lying; for there are some people who lie for the mere sake of lying. 
 108 尽管人们可能对他们所说的话不感兴趣，但我们不能由此断定他们没有说谎；因为有些人只是为了撒谎而撒谎。
  109  When we are well we wonder what we would do if we were ill, but when we are ill we take medicine cheerfully; the illness persuades us to do so. 
 109 健康时，我们想知道如果我们生病了怎么办，但当我们生病时，我们高兴地吃药；疾病说服我们这样做。
We have no longer the passions and desires for amusements and promenades which health gave to us, but which are incompatible with the necessities of illness. 
我们不再有健康所赋予我们的娱乐和散步的热情和渴望，但它们与疾病的需要是不相容的。
Nature gives us, then, passions and desires suitable to our present state.[64] We are only troubled by the fears which we, and not nature, give ourselves, for they add to the state in which we are the passions of the state in which we are not. 
那么，大自然赋予我们适合我们目前状态的激情和欲望。 [64]我们所困扰的只是我们自己而非大自然给自己带来的恐惧，因为它们使我们所处的状态更加强烈，而我们所不存在的状态又更加强烈。
 As nature makes us always unhappy in every state, our desires picture to us a happy state; because they add to the state in which we are the pleasures of the state in which we are not. 
正如大自然让我们在任何状态下总是不快乐一样，我们的欲望向我们描绘了一种快乐的状态；因为它们增加了我们所处的状态和我们不存在的状态的快乐。
And if we attained to these pleasures, we should not be happy after all; because we should have other desires natural to this new state. 
如果我们获得了这些快乐，我们终究不会幸福；因为我们应该有这个新状态自然而然的其他欲望。
 We must particularise this general proposition.... 
我们必须具体说明这个一般性命题……
  110  The consciousness of the falsity of present pleasures, and the ignorance of the vanity of absent pleasures, cause inconstancy. 
 110 意识到眼前的快乐是虚假的，而忽视了不在场的快乐的虚荣，会导致不稳定。
  111  _Inconstancy._--We think we are playing on ordinary organs when playing upon man. 
 111 _Inconstancy._--我们以为我们在玩弄人时却在玩普通的器官。
Men are organs, it is true, but, odd, changeable, variable [with pipes not arranged in proper order. 
人是器官，这是事实，但是，奇怪的、多变的、可变的[管道没有按正确的顺序排列。
Those who only know how to play on ordinary organs] will not produce harmonies on these. 
那些只知道如何演奏普通管风琴的人不会用这些管风琴演奏和声。
We must know where [_the keys_] are. 
我们必须知道[_钥匙_]在哪里。
  112  _Inconstancy._--Things have different qualities, and the soul different inclinations; for nothing is simple which is presented to the soul, and the soul never presents itself simply to any object. 
 112_世事无常。_--事物有不同的性质，灵魂也有不同的倾向；因为呈现在灵魂面前的一切都不是简单的，而灵魂也从来不会简单地将自己呈现给任何物体。
Hence it comes that we weep and laugh at the same thing. 
因此，我们会为同一件事而哭泣和欢笑。
  113  _Inconstancy and oddity._--To live only by work, and to rule over the most powerful State in the world, are very opposite things. 
 113_反复无常和古怪。_--仅靠工作生活和统治世界上最强大的国家，是非常相反的事情。
They are united in the person of the great Sultan of the Turks. 
他们在伟大的土耳其苏丹身上团结起来。
  114  Variety is as abundant as all tones of the voice, all ways of walking, coughing, blowing the nose, sneezing. 
 114 各种声调、走路方式、咳嗽、擤鼻涕、打喷嚏的方式多种多样。
We distinguish vines by their fruit, and call them the Condrien, the Desargues, and such and such a stock. 
我们根据葡萄树的果实来区分它们，并称它们为康德里恩（Condrien）、德沙格（Desargues）以及诸如此类的树种。
Is this all? Has a vine ever produced two bunches exactly the same, and has a bunch two grapes alike? etc. 
这就是全部吗？一棵葡萄树是否曾经结出两串完全相同的葡萄，并且有一串葡萄有两颗相似的葡萄？ ETC。
 I can never judge of the same thing exactly in the same way. 
我永远无法以完全相同的方式来判断同一件事。
I cannot judge of my work, while doing it. 
我在工作时无法评判我的工作。
I must do as the artists, stand at a distance, but not too far. 
我必须像艺术家一样，保持一定的距离，但不能太远。
How far, then? Guess. 
那么还有多远呢？猜测。
  115  _Variety._--Theology is a science, but at the same time how many sciences? A man is a whole; but if we dissect him, will he be the head, the heart, the stomach, the veins, each vein, each portion of a vein, the blood, each humour in the blood?  A town, a country-place, is from afar a town and a country-place. 
 115 _Variety._--神学是一门科学，但同时有多少门科学？人是一个整体；但如果我们解剖他，他会是头、心脏、胃、静脉、每一条静脉、静脉的每一部分、血液、血液中的每一种体液吗？一个城镇，一个乡村，从远处看就是一个城镇和一个乡村。
But, as we draw near, there are houses, trees, tiles, leaves, grass, ants, limbs of ants, in infinity. 
但是，当我们走近时，就会看到无穷无尽的房屋、树木、瓦片、树叶、草、蚂蚁、蚂蚁的肢体。
All this is contained under the name of country-place. 
这一切都包含在乡村的名字之下。
  116  _Thoughts._--All is one, all is different. 
 116 _Thoughts._--一切都是一，一切都是不同的。
How many natures exist in man? How many vocations? And by what chance does each man ordinarily choose what he has heard praised? A well-turned heel. 
人有多少种本性？有多少种职业？每个人通常有什么机会选择他所听到的赞扬呢？精巧的鞋跟。
"  117  _The heel of a slipper._--""Ah! How well this is turned! Here is a clever workman! How brave is this soldier!"" This is the source of our inclinations, and of the choice of conditions. "
117 _拖鞋的鞋跟._--“啊！这车转得多好啊！这是一个聪明的工人！这个士兵多么勇敢！”这是我们的倾向和条件选择的根源。
How much this man drinks! How little that one! This makes people sober or drunk, soldiers, cowards, etc. 
这人喝了多少酒啊！那个多么少啊！这使人清醒或醉酒、士兵、懦夫等。
  118  Chief talent, that which rules the rest. 
 118 首席人才，统治其他人。
  119  Nature imitates herself. 
 119 大自然模仿自己。
A seed sown in good ground brings forth fruit. 
撒在好土里的种子会结出果实。
A principle, instilled into a good mind, brings forth fruit. 
原则一旦灌输到良好的头脑中，就会结出果实。
Numbers imitate space, which is of a different nature. 
数字模仿空间，其性质不同。
 All is made and led by the same master, root, branches, and fruits; principles and consequences. 
一切都是由同一个主人所创造和领导的，根、枝、果；原则和后果。
  120  [Nature diversifies and imitates; art imitates and diversifies.]   121  Nature always begins the same things again, the years, the days, the hours; in like manner spaces and numbers follow each other from beginning to end. 
 120【自然多样化和模仿；艺术模仿并多样化。] 121 大自然总是再次开始同样的事情，岁月，日子，小时；同样，空格和数字从头到尾都是相伴的。
Thus is made a kind of infinity and eternity. 
这样就形成了一种无限和永恒。
Not that anything in all this is infinite and eternal, but these finite realities are infinitely multiplied. 
并不是说这一切中的任何事物都是无限和永恒的，而是这些有限的现实被无限地倍增。
Thus it seems to me to be only the number which multiplies them that is infinite. 
因此，在我看来，只有将它们相乘的数才是无限的。
  122  Time heals griefs and quarrels, for we change and are no longer the same persons. 
 122、时间可以治愈悲伤和争吵，因为我们都变了，不再是同一个人了。
Neither the offender nor the offended are any more themselves. 
冒犯者和被冒犯者都不再是他们自己了。
It is like a nation which we have provoked, but meet again after two generations. 
就像一个民族，我们曾经挑衅过，但两代人之后又相遇了。
They are still Frenchmen, but not the same. 
他们仍然是法国人，但不一样了。
  123  He no longer loves the person whom he loved ten years ago. 
 123 他不再爱十年前爱过的人了。
I quite believe it. 
我非常相信。
She is no longer the same, nor is he. 
她不再是原来的她，他也不再是原来的她了。
He was young, and she also; she is quite different. 
他还年轻，她也年轻；她很不一样。
He would perhaps love her yet, if she were what she was then. 
如果她还是当时的样子，他也许还会爱她。
  124  We view things not only from different sides, but with different eyes; we have no wish to find them alike. 
 124 我们不仅从不同的侧面，而且用不同的眼睛来看待事物；我们不希望发现他们是一样的。
  125  _Contraries._--Man is naturally credulous and incredulous, timid and rash. 
 125_相反._--人天生轻信又多疑，胆怯又鲁莽。
  126  Description of man: dependency, desire of independence, need. 
126 对人的描述：依赖性、独立欲望、需要。
  127  Condition of man: inconstancy, weariness, unrest. 
 127 人的状况：反复无常、疲倦、不安。
  128  The weariness which is felt by us in leaving pursuits to which we are attached. 
 128 放弃我们所执着的追求时我们感到的疲倦。
A man dwells at home with pleasure; but if he sees a woman who charms him, or if he enjoys himself in play for five or six days, he is miserable if he returns to his former way of living. 
一个人安居在家里，心情舒畅；但是，如果他看到一个使他着迷的女人，或者他玩了五六天，如果他回到原来的生活方式，他就会很痛苦。
Nothing is more common than that. 
没有什么比这更常见的了。
  129  Our nature consists in motion; complete rest is death.[65]   130  _Restlessness._--If a soldier, or labourer, complain of the hardship of his lot, set him to do nothing. 
 129 我们的本性在于运动；完全的休息就是死亡。[65] 130_焦躁不安。_--如果一个士兵或工人抱怨自己命运的艰辛，就让他无所事事。
  131  _Weariness._[66]--Nothing is so insufferable to man as to be completely at rest, without passions, without business, without diversion, without study. 
 131_疲倦._[66]--对人来说，没有什么比完全休息、没有激情、没有生意、没有消遣、没有学习更令人难以忍受的了。
He then feels his nothingness, his forlornness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness. 
然后他感到自己的虚无、孤独、不足、依赖、软弱、空虚。
There will immediately arise from the depth of his heart weariness, gloom, sadness, fretfulness, vexation, despair. 
他的内心深处立刻会升起疲倦、忧郁、悲伤、烦躁、苦恼、绝望。
  132  Methinks Cæsar was too old to set about amusing himself with conquering the world.[67] Such sport was good for Augustus or Alexander. 
 132 我认为凯撒已经太老了，无法以征服世界为乐。[67]这样的运动对奥古斯都或亚历山大来说是有好处的。
They were still young men, and thus difficult to restrain. 
他们还年轻，很难约束。
But Cæsar should have been more mature. 
但凯撒应该更成熟。
  133  Two faces which resemble each other, make us laugh, when together, by their resemblance, though neither of them by itself makes us laugh. 
 133 两张彼此相似的面孔在一起时，会因它们的相似而使我们发笑，尽管它们本身都不会使我们发笑。
  134  How useless is painting, which attracts admiration by the resemblance of things, the originals of which we do not admire!   135  The struggle alone pleases us, not the victory. 
 134 绘画是多么无用啊，它以事物的相似性来吸引人们的钦佩，而我们并不欣赏其本来面目！ 135 使我们高兴的只有斗争，而不是胜利。
We love to see animals fighting, not the victor infuriated over the vanquished. 
我们喜欢看到动物打架，而不是胜利者对战败者感到愤怒。
We would only see the victorious end; and, as soon as it comes, we are satiated. 
我们只会看到胜利的结局；一旦它到来，我们就心满意足了。
It is the same in play, and the same in the search for truth. 
游戏中如此，探求真理时亦然。
In disputes we like to see the clash of opinions, but not at all to contemplate truth when found. 
在争论中，我们喜欢看到意见的冲突，但根本不去思考发现的真相。
To observe it with pleasure, we have to see it emerge out of strife. 
为了愉快地观察它，我们必须看到它从冲突中显现出来。
So in the passions, there is pleasure in seeing the collision of two contraries; but when one acquires the mastery, it becomes only brutality. 
因此，在激情中，看到两个对立面的碰撞是令人愉悦的；但当一个人掌握了权力时，它就变成了残酷。
We never seek things for themselves, but for the search. 
我们从不为事物本身寻求事物，而是为了寻找。
Likewise in plays, scenes which do not rouse the emotion of fear are worthless, so are extreme and hopeless misery, brutal lust, and extreme cruelty. 
同样，在戏剧中，不引起恐惧情绪的场景是毫无价值的，极端而无望的痛苦、残酷的欲望和极端的残忍也是如此。
  136  A mere trifle consoles us, for a mere trifle distresses us.[68]   137  Without examining every particular pursuit, it is enough to comprehend them under diversion. 
 136 一件小事就可以安慰我们，因为一件小事就可以使我们痛苦。[68] 137 无需考察每一项特定的追求，只要在消遣下理解它们就足够了。
  138  Men naturally slaters and of all callings, save in their own rooms. 
 138、男人自然会从事各种职业，除了在自己的房间里。
  139  _Diversion._--When I have occasionally set myself to consider the different distractions of men, the pains and perils to which they expose themselves at court or in war, whence arise so many quarrels, passions, bold and often bad ventures, etc., I have discovered that all the unhappiness of men arises from one single fact, that they cannot stay quietly in their own chamber. 
139_消遣._--当我偶尔让自己思考人们的不同干扰、他们在宫廷或战争中所面临的痛苦和危险时，就会产生如此多的争吵、激情、大胆且常常是糟糕的冒险等等……我发现，人的一切不幸都源于一个事实，那就是他们不能安静地呆在自己的房间里。
A man who has enough to live on, if he knew how to stay with pleasure at home, would not leave it to go to sea or to besiege a town. 
一个有足够生活的人，如果他知道如何快乐地呆在家里，就不会离开它去出海或围攻城镇。
A commission in the army would not be bought so dearly, but that it is found insufferable not to budge from the town; and men only seek conversation and entering games, because they cannot remain with pleasure at home. 
军队中的任命不会花那么大的钱，但人们发现不离开城镇是令人难以忍受的。男人只追求谈话和游戏，因为他们不能快乐地呆在家里。
 But on further consideration, when, after finding the cause of all our ills, I have sought to discover the reason of it, I have found that there is one very real reason, namely, the natural poverty of our feeble and mortal condition, so miserable that nothing can comfort us when we think of it closely. 
但进一步考虑，当我找到了我们所有疾病的原因后，试图找出其原因时，我发现有一个非常真实的原因，那就是我们脆弱和必死的状况的自然贫困，所以可悲的是，当我们仔细思考时，没有什么可以安慰我们。
 Whatever condition we picture to ourselves, if we muster all the good things which it is possible to possess, royalty is the finest position in the world. 
无论我们对自己的想象如何，如果我们聚集了所有可能拥有的美好事物，皇室就是世界上最好的地位。
Yet, when we imagine a king attended with every pleasure he can feel, if he be without diversion, and be left to consider and reflect on what he is, this feeble happiness will not sustain him; he will necessarily fall into forebodings of dangers, of revolutions which may happen, and, finally, of death and inevitable disease; so that if he be without what is called diversion, he is unhappy, and more unhappy than the least of his subjects who plays and diverts himself. 
然而，当我们想象一位国王享受着他所能感受到的一切快乐时，如果他没有消遣，并且可以思考和反思他是谁，那么这种微弱的幸福就无法支撑他；他必然会预感到危险、可能发生的革命，最后预感死亡和不可避免的疾病。因此，如果他没有所谓的消遣，他就会不快乐，而且比那些自己玩耍和消遣的臣民还要不快乐。
 Hence it comes that play and the society of women, war, and high posts, are so sought after. 
因此，游戏、女性社交、战争和高职都受到如此追捧。
Not that there is in fact any happiness in them, or that men imagine true bliss to consist in money won at play, or in the hare which they hunt; we would not take these as a gift. 
这并不是说他们实际上有任何幸福，也不是说人们把真正的幸福想象成是在玩耍中赢得的金钱，或者是他们猎取的野兔；但事实上，他们的幸福并不在于他们的幸福。我们不会把这些当作礼物。
We do not seek that easy and peaceful lot which permits us to think of our unhappy condition, nor the dangers of war, nor the labour of office, but the bustle which averts these thoughts of ours, and amuses us. 
我们追求的不是安逸、平静的命运，让我们思考自己的不幸处境，也不是战争的危险，也不是办公室的劳作，而是忙碌的生活，它可以转移我们的这些想法，让我们开心。
 Reasons why we like the chase better than the quarry. 
为什么我们更喜欢追逐而不是采石场。
 Hence it comes that men so much love noise and stir; hence it comes that the prison is so horrible a punishment; hence it comes that the pleasure of solitude is a thing incomprehensible. 
因此，男人如此喜爱喧闹和骚动。因此，监狱是一种如此可怕的惩罚。因此，独处的乐趣是难以理解的。
And it is in fact the greatest source of happiness in the condition of kings, that men try incessantly to divert them, and to procure for them all kinds of pleasures. 
事实上，国王的最大幸福源泉就是人们不断地为他们谋取利益，为他们争取各种快乐。
 The king is surrounded by persons whose only thought is to divert the king, and to prevent his thinking of self. 
国王周围都是一些人，他们唯一的想法就是转移国王的注意力，阻止他想到自我。
For he is unhappy, king though he be, if he think of himself. 
因为，尽管他是国王，但如果他想到自己，他就会感到不快乐。
 This is all that men have been able to discover to make themselves happy. 
这就是人们能够发现的使自己快乐的一切。
And those who philosophise on the matter, and who think men unreasonable for spending a whole day in chasing a hare which they would not have bought, scarce know our nature. 
那些对这个问题进行哲学思考的人，以及那些认为人类花一整天去追一只他们不会买的兔子是不合理的人，很少了解我们的本性。
The hare in itself would not screen us from the sight of death and calamities; but the chase which turns away our attention from these, does screen us. 
野兔本身并不能使我们免受死亡和灾难的影响。但是，那些将我们的注意力从这些事情上转移开的追逐确实屏蔽了我们。
 The advice given to Pyrrhus to take the rest which he was about to seek with so much labour, was full of difficulties.[69]  [To bid a man live quietly is to bid him live happily. 
给皮洛士的建议是他要花费如此多的努力来寻求休息，但这个建议充满了困难。 [69] 【让一个人安静地生活，就是让他快乐地生活。
It is to advise him to be in a state perfectly happy, in which he can think at leisure without finding therein a cause of distress. 
这是建议他处于一种完全快乐的状态，在这种状态下他可以悠闲地思考，而不会在其中找到痛苦的原因。
This is to misunderstand nature. 
这是对自然的误解。
 As men who naturally understand their own condition avoid nothing so much as rest, so there is nothing they leave undone in seeking turmoil. 
正如那些自然了解自己处境的人除了休息之外什么都避免不了一样，因此，他们在寻求混乱时也不会遗漏任何事情。
Not that they have an instinctive knowledge of true happiness ... 
并不是说他们对真正的幸福有本能的了解......
 So we are wrong in blaming them. 
所以我们责怪他们是错误的。
Their error does not lie in seeking excitement, if they seek it only as a diversion; the evil is that they seek it as if the possession of the objects of their quest would make them really happy. 
如果他们只是为了消遣，那么他们的错误并不在于寻求刺激；邪恶的是，他们追求它，好像拥有他们追求的目标就会让他们真正快乐。
In this respect it is right to call their quest a vain one. 
从这方面来说，称他们的追求是徒劳的是正确的。
Hence in all this both the censurers and the censured do not understand man's true nature.]  And thus, when we take the exception against them, that what they seek with such fervour cannot satisfy them, if they replied--as they should do if they considered the matter thoroughly--that they sought in it only a violent and impetuous occupation which turned their thoughts from self, and that they therefore chose an attractive object to charm and ardently attract them, they would leave their opponents without a reply. 
因此，在所有这一切中，谴责者和被谴责者都不了解人的真实本性。]因此，当我们对他们提出例外时，他们如此热情地寻求的东西不能满足他们，如果他们回答的话——就像他们应该做的那样他们仔细地考虑过这个问题——他们只是寻求一种暴力和冲动的职业，使他们的思想脱离自我，因此他们选择了一个有吸引力的对象来迷惑和热烈地吸引他们，他们会让他们的对手无话可说。
But they do not make this reply, because they do not know themselves.[70] They do not know that it is the chase, and not the quarry, which they seek. 
但他们并没有做出这样的回答，因为他们不了解自己。 [70]他们不知道他们寻找的是猎物，而不是猎物。
 Dancing: we must consider rightly where to place our feet.--A gentleman sincerely believes that hunting is great and royal sport; but a beater is not of this opinion. 
跳舞：要考虑好脚的位置。——君子真诚地认为狩猎是伟大的皇家运动；但打手却不这么认为。
 They imagine that if they obtained such a post, they would then rest with pleasure, and are insensible of the insatiable nature of their desire. 
他们想象，如果获得这样的职位，他们就会心满意足，而不会意识到自己的欲望是无法满足的。
They think they are truly seeking quiet, and they are only seeking excitement. 
他们以为自己是真正寻求安静，其实只是寻求刺激。
 They have a secret instinct which impels them to seek amusement and occupation abroad, and which arises from the sense of their constant unhappiness. 
他们有一种隐秘的本能，驱使他们去国外寻找娱乐和职业，而这种本能源于他们持续不快乐的感觉。
They have another secret instinct, a remnant of the greatness of our original nature, which teaches them that happiness in reality consists only in rest, and not in stir. 
他们还有另一种秘密的本能，这是我们原始本性的伟大残余，它告诉他们现实中的幸福只在于休息，而不是激动。
And of these two contrary instincts they form within themselves a confused idea, which hides itself from their view in the depths of their soul, inciting them to aim at rest through excitement, and always to fancy that the satisfaction which they have not will come to them, if, by surmounting whatever difficulties confront them, they can thereby open the door to rest. 
对于这两种相反的本能，他们在自己内心形成了一种混乱的观念，这种观念隐藏在他们灵魂深处的视线之外，促使他们通过兴奋来寻求休息，并且总是幻想他们不会得到的满足。如果他们克服了所面临的任何困难，就能打开安息之门。
 Thus passes away all man's life. 
人的一生就这样过去了。
Men seek rest in a struggle against difficulties; and when they have conquered these, rest becomes insufferable. 
人在与困难的斗争中寻求休息；当他们克服了这些之后，休息就变得难以忍受了。
For we think either of the misfortunes we have or of those which threaten us. 
因为我们要么想到我们所拥有的不幸，要么想到那些威胁我们的不幸。
And even if we should see ourselves sufficiently sheltered on all sides, weariness of its own accord would not fail to arise from the depths of the heart wherein it has its natural roots, and to fill the mind with its poison. 
即使我们看到自己在各个方面都得到了充分的保护，疲倦也不会不从内心深处自然而然地升起，疲倦的根源就在内心深处，并用它的毒液充满我们的心灵。
 Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without any cause for weariness from the peculiar state of his disposition; and so frivolous is he, that, though full of a thousand reasons for weariness, the least thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a ball, is sufficient to amuse him. 
人是如此不幸，即使没有任何理由，他也会因自己的性格的特殊状态而感到疲倦。他是如此的轻浮，尽管有一千个疲倦的理由，但哪怕是最小的事情，比如打台球或打球，也足以让他开心。
 But will you say what object has he in all this? The pleasure of bragging to-morrow among his friends that he has played better than another. 
但你能说他做这一切有什么目的吗？明天在他的朋友们面前吹嘘他比别人打得更好的乐趣。
So others sweat in their own rooms to show to the learned that they have solved a problem in algebra, which no one had hitherto been able to solve. 
因此，其他人在自己的房间里流汗，向学者们展示他们已经解决了代数问题，而迄今为止还没有人能够解决这个问题。
Many more expose themselves to extreme perils, in my opinion as foolishly, in order to boast afterwards that they have captured a town. 
更多的人将自己置于极端危险之中，在我看来这是愚蠢的，以便事后吹嘘他们已经占领了一座城镇。
Lastly, others wear themselves out in studying all these things, not in order to become wiser, but only in order to prove that they know them; and these are the most senseless of the band, since they are so knowingly, whereas one may suppose of the others, that if they knew it, they would no longer be foolish. 
最后，其他人在研究所有这些事情时耗尽了自己的精力，不是为了变得更聪明，而只是为了证明他们了解这些事情；这些人是这帮人中最愚蠢的，因为他们是如此知情，而其他人可能会认为，如果他们知道这一点，他们就不再愚蠢了。
 This man spends his life without weariness in playing every day for a small stake. 
这个人每天都在为一小笔赌注而不知疲倦地度过一生。
Give him each morning the money he can win each day, on condition he does not play; you make him miserable. 
每天早上给他每天能赢的钱，条件是他不玩；你让他很痛苦。
It will perhaps be said that he seeks the amusement of play and not the winnings. 
也许有人会说，他寻求的是游戏的乐趣而不是胜利。
Make him then play for nothing; he will not become excited over it, and will feel bored. 
让他白白玩；他不会因此而兴奋，反而会感到无聊。
It is then not the amusement alone that he seeks; a languid and passionless amusement will weary him. 
那么，他所寻求的不仅仅是娱乐；他所寻求的不仅仅是娱乐。一种无精打采、毫无激情的娱乐会使他感到疲倦。
He must get excited over it, and deceive himself by the fancy that he will be happy to win what he would not have as a gift on condition of not playing; and he must make for himself an object of passion, and excite over it his desire, his anger, his fear, to obtain his imagined end, as children are frightened at the face they have blackened. 
他一定会为此感到兴奋，并欺骗自己，幻想自己会很高兴赢得不参加比赛而得不到的礼物；他必须为自己创造一个激情的对象，激发他的欲望、他的愤怒、他的恐惧，以达到他想象中的目的，就像孩子们害怕他们把脸弄黑一样。
 Whence comes it that this man, who lost his only son a few months ago, or who this morning was in such trouble through being distressed by lawsuits and quarrels, now no longer thinks of them? Do not wonder; he is quite taken up in looking out for the boar which his dogs have been hunting so hotly for the last six hours. 
这个几个月前失去独生子的人，或者今天早上因诉讼和争吵而陷入困境的人，现在怎么不再想起他们了？不要奇怪；他全神贯注地寻找那头野猪，在过去的六个小时里，他的狗一直在疯狂地追捕野猪。
He requires nothing more. 
他不需要更多了。
However full of sadness a man may be, he is happy for the time, if you can prevail upon him to enter into some amusement; and however happy a man may be, he will soon be discontented and wretched, if he be not diverted and occupied by some passion or pursuit which prevents weariness from overcoming him. 
无论一个人多么悲伤，只要你能说服他参加一些娱乐活动，他就会暂时感到高兴。无论一个人多么幸福，如果他不被某种激情或追求所吸引和占据，以防止疲倦战胜他，他很快就会感到不满和不幸。
Without amusement there is no joy; with amusement there is no sadness. 
没有娱乐就没有快乐；有娱乐就没有悲伤。
And this also constitutes the happiness of persons in high position, that they have a number of people to amuse them, and have the power to keep themselves in this state. 
而这也构成了位高权重者的幸福，因为他们有很多人可以娱乐他们，并且有权力让自己保持在这种状态。
 Consider this. 
考虑一下这一点。
What is it to be superintendent, chancellor, first president, but to be in a condition wherein from early morning a large number of people come from all quarters to see them, so as not to leave them an hour in the day in which they can think of themselves? And when they are in disgrace and sent back to their country houses, where they lack neither wealth nor servants to help them on occasion, they do not fail to be wretched and desolate, because no one prevents them from thinking of themselves. 
当校长、总理、第一任总统，不就是从一大早起就有大量的人从四面八方来看望他们，不让他们在一天中留下一个小时的时间吗？想想自己？当他们蒙羞被送回乡间别墅时，他们既不缺乏财富，也不缺乏仆人来帮助他们，他们也不会不感到悲惨和凄凉，因为没有人阻止他们为自己着想。
  140  [How does it happen that this man, so distressed at the death of his wife and his only son, or who has some great lawsuit which annoys him, is not at this moment sad, and that he seems so free from all painful and disquieting thoughts? We need not wonder; for a ball has been served him, and he must return it to his companion. 
140 [为什么这个男人，因妻子和独生子的去世而如此痛苦，或者有什么大官司让他烦恼，此时此刻却没有悲伤，而且他看起来如此摆脱了所有的痛苦和痛苦？令人不安的想法？我们不必怀疑；因为一个球已经发给他了，他必须把它还给他的同伴。
He is occupied in catching it in its fall from the roof, to win a game. 
他正忙着接住从屋顶掉下来的球，以赢得一场比赛。
How can he think of his own affairs, pray, when he has this other matter in hand? Here is a care worthy of occupying this great soul, and taking away from him every other thought of the mind. 
祈祷，当他手头还有这件事的时候，他怎么能想到自己的事情呢？这是一种值得占据这个伟大灵魂的关怀，并带走他头脑中的所有其他想法。
This man, born to know the universe, to judge all causes, to govern a whole state, is altogether occupied and taken up with the business of catching a hare. 
这个人生来就认识宇宙、判断一切原因、治理整个国家，却全心全意地忙着抓兔子的事。
And if he does not lower himself to this, and wants always to be on the strain, he will be more foolish still, because he would raise himself above humanity; and after all he is only a man, that is to say capable of little and of much, of all and of nothing; he is neither angel nor brute, but man.]   141  Men spend their time in following a ball or a hare; it is the pleasure even of kings. 
如果他不降低自己的地位，而总是想承受压力，那么他就会更加愚蠢，因为他会把自己抬高到人类之上；他会变得更加愚蠢。毕竟，他只是一个人，也就是说，他能做的很少，也能做很多，既能做一切，又能做一无所有。他既不是天使，也不是野兽，而是人。] 141 人花时间追随球或野兔；即使是国王也是如此。
  142  _Diversion._--Is not the royal dignity sufficiently great in itself to make its possessor happy by the mere contemplation of what he is? Must he be diverted from this thought like ordinary folk? I see well that a man is made happy by diverting him from the view of his domestic sorrows so as to occupy all his thoughts with the care of dancing well. 
 142_转移._——王室尊严本身难道不足以让其拥有者仅仅通过思考他的身份而感到高兴吗？他必须像普通人一样摆脱这种想法吗？我清楚地看到，一个人若能摆脱家庭的悲伤，全心全神贯注于跳舞，就会感到幸福。
But will it be the same with a king, and will he be happier in the pursuit of these idle amusements than in the contemplation of his greatness? And what more satisfactory object could be presented to his mind? Would it not be a deprivation of his delight for him to occupy his soul with the thought of how to adjust his steps to the cadence of an air, or of how to throw a [ball] skilfully, instead of leaving it to enjoy quietly the contemplation of the majestic glory which encompasses him? Let us make the trial; let us leave a king all alone to reflect on himself quite at leisure, without any gratification of the senses, without any care in his mind, without society; and we will see that a king without diversion is a man full of wretchedness. 
但国王也会如此吗？他追求这些无聊的娱乐会比沉思他的伟大更快乐吗？还有什么比这更让他心满意足的呢？如果他用心灵去思考如何调整自己的脚步以适应空气的节奏，或者如何巧妙地投球，而不是让它静静地享受，这难道不是剥夺了他的快乐吗？沉思围绕着他的雄伟荣耀？让我们来进行审判吧；让我们让国王独自一人，在闲暇时反思自己，没有任何感官的满足，没有任何忧虑，没有社会；我们将会看到，一个没有消遣的国王是一个充满不幸的人。
So this is carefully avoided, and near the persons of kings there never fail to be a great number of people who see to it that amusement follows business, and who watch all the time of their leisure to supply them with delights and games, so that there is no blank in it. 
因此，这种情况是要小心避免的，在国王的身边，总是有很多人，他们认为娱乐先于事务，并在他们闲暇的时候注视着为他们提供欢乐和游戏，这样，里面没有空白。
In fact, kings are surrounded with persons who are wonderfully attentive in taking care that the king be not alone and in a state to think of himself, knowing well that he will be miserable, king though he be, if he meditate on self. 
事实上，国王周围都是非常细心的人，他们非常细心地照顾国王，让他不孤单，并处于只考虑自己的状态，因为他很清楚，尽管他是国王，但如果他沉思自我，他会很痛苦。
 In all this I am not talking of Christian kings as Christians, but only as kings. 
在这一切中，我并不是说基督教国王是基督徒，而只是作为国王。
  143  _Diversion._--Men are entrusted from infancy with the care of their honour, their property, their friends, and even with the property and the honour of their friends. 
 143 _转移._--男人从婴儿期起就被委托照顾他们的荣誉、他们的财产、他们的朋友，甚至他们的朋友的财产和荣誉。
They are overwhelmed with business, with the study of languages, and with physical exercise;[71] and they are made to understand that they cannot be happy unless their health, their honour, their fortune and that of their friends be in good condition, and that a single thing wanting will make them unhappy. 
他们被生意、语言学习和体育锻炼压得喘不过气来；[71]他们被告知，除非他们的健康、荣誉、财富和朋友的健康、荣誉、财富和朋友都处于良好状态，否则他们不可能幸福，缺少一件事就会让他们不高兴。
Thus they are given cares and business which make them bustle about from break of day.--It is, you will exclaim, a strange way to make them happy! What more could be done to make them miserable?--Indeed! what could be done? We should only have to relieve them from all these cares; for then they would see themselves: they would reflect on what they are, whence they came, whither they go, and thus we cannot employ and divert them too much. 
这样，他们就得到了关心和事务，使他们从天一亮就忙碌起来。——你会惊呼，这是一种让他们快乐的奇怪方式！还有什么比这更能让他们痛苦的呢？——确实如此！可以做什么？我们只需要把他们从这些忧虑中解脱出来就可以了。因为那时他们会看到自己：他们会反思自己是什么，从哪里来，到哪里去，因此我们不能过多地使用和转移他们。
And this is why, after having given them so much business, we advise them, if they have some time for relaxation, to employ it in amusement, in play, and to be always fully occupied. 
这就是为什么，在给了他们这么多的生意之后，我们建议他们，如果他们有一些放松的时间，就把它用在娱乐、玩耍上，并且总是全神贯注。
 How hollow and full of ribaldry is the heart of man!   144  I spent a long time in the study of the abstract sciences, and was disheartened by the small number of fellow-students in them. 
人心是多么空虚、充满下流啊！ 144 我花了很长时间研究抽象科学，并为其中的同学太少而感到沮丧。
When I commenced the study of man, I saw that these abstract sciences are not suited to man, and that I was wandering farther from my own state in examining them, than others in not knowing them. 
当我开始研究人类时，我发现这些抽象的科学并不适合人类，而且我在研究它们时比其他人在不了解它们时更加偏离了自己的状态。
I pardoned their little knowledge; but I thought at least to find many companions in the study of man, and that it was the true study which is suited to him. 
我原谅他们知识浅薄；但我认为至少在人类研究中可以找到许多同伴，而且这才是适合人类的真正研究。
I have been deceived; still fewer study it than geometry. 
我被欺骗了；研究它的人比研究几何学的人还要少。
It is only from the want of knowing how to study this that we seek the other studies. 
只是因为想要知道如何研究这一点，我们才寻求其他研究。
But is it not that even here is not the knowledge which man should have, and that for the purpose of happiness it is better for him not to know himself?   145  [One thought alone occupies us; we cannot think of two things at the same time. 
但这难道不是人应该拥有的知识吗？为了幸福，他最好不认识自己吗？ 145【我们只有一个思想；我们不能同时思考两件事。
This is lucky for us according to the world, not according to God.]   146  Man is obviously made to think. 
根据世界，而不是根据上帝，这对我们来说是幸运的。] 146 人显然是生来思考的。
It is his whole dignity and his whole merit; and his whole duty is to think as he ought. 
这是他全部的尊严，也是他全部的优点；他的全部职责就是按他应该的方式思考。
Now, the order of thought is to begin with self, and with its Author and its end. 
现在，思想的顺序是从自我开始，然后是它的作者和它的终点。
 Now, of what does the world think? Never of this, but of dancing, playing the lute, singing, making verses, running at the ring, etc., fighting, making oneself king, without thinking what it is to be a king and what to be a man. 
现在，世界怎么看？不是这个，而是跳舞、弹琴、唱歌、赋诗、跑擂台等等，打架，自立为王，而不去想什么是王，什么是人。
  147  We do not content ourselves with the life we have in ourselves and in our own being; we desire to live an imaginary life in the mind of others, and for this purpose we endeavour to shine. 
 147 我们不满足于我们自己和我们自己所拥有的生命；我们渴望过上别人心目中想象的生活，为此我们努力发光发热。
We labour unceasingly to adorn and preserve this imaginary existence, and neglect the real. 
我们不断地努力装饰和维护这种想象的存在，而忽视了真实的存在。
And if we possess calmness, or generosity, or truthfulness, we are eager to make it known, so as to attach these virtues to that imaginary existence. 
如果我们拥有冷静、慷慨或诚实，我们就会渴望让它为人所知，以便将这些美德附加到那个想象的存在上。
We would rather separate them from ourselves to join them to it; and we would willingly be cowards in order to acquire the reputation of being brave. 
我们宁愿将他们与我们分开，也不愿将他们加入其中；为了获得勇敢的名声，我们甘愿做胆小鬼。
A great proof of the nothingness of our being, not to be satisfied with the one without the other, and to renounce the one for the other! For he would be infamous who would not die to preserve his honour. 
这是我们存在的虚无的一个很好的证明，不满足于一个而没有另一个，并且为了另一个而放弃一个！因为如果他不肯以死来维护自己的荣誉，他就会臭名昭著。
  148  We are so presumptuous that we would wish to be known by all the world, even by people who shall come after, when we shall be no more; and we are so vain that the esteem of five or six neighbours delights and contents us. 
 148我们是如此自以为是，以至于我们希望被全世界所认识，甚至当我们不在时，被后来的人所认识；我们是如此虚荣，以至于五六个邻居的尊重让我们感到高兴和满足。
  149  We do not trouble ourselves about being esteemed in the towns through which we pass. 
 149、我们不为自己在所经过的城镇中受到尊重而烦恼。

需要多长时间？与我们虚荣而微不足道的生活相称的时光。
  150  Vanity is so anchored in the heart of man that a soldier, a soldier's servant, a cook, a porter brags, and wishes to have his admirers. 
 150 虚荣心如此根植于人心，以至于士兵、士兵的仆人、厨师、搬运工都喜欢吹牛，并希望拥有自己的崇拜者。

Those who write against it want to have the glory of having written well;[72] and those who read it desire the glory of having read it.

I who write this have perhaps this desire, and perhaps those who will read it ... 
写这篇文章的我也许有这个愿望，也许那些会读到它的人......
  151  _Glory._--Admiration spoils all from infancy. 
 151 _荣耀._--从婴儿时期起，钦佩就会毁掉一切。

  154  [I have no friends] to your advantage]. 
 154【我没有朋友】对你有利]。
  155  A true friend is so great an advantage, even for the greatest lords, in order that he may speak well of them, and back them in their absence, that they should do all to have one. 
 155 一个真正的朋友即使对最伟大的领主来说也是一种巨大的优势，因为他可以在他们缺席时称赞他们并支持他们，因此他们应该尽一切努力拥有一个。
But they should choose well; for, if they spend all their efforts in the interests of fools, it will be of no use, however well these may speak of them; and these will not even speak well of them if they find themselves on the weakest side, for they have no influence; and thus they will speak ill of them in company. 
但他们应该选择好；因为，如果他们把所有的努力都花在愚人的利益上，那么无论这些人如何谈论他们，那都是没有用的。如果他们发现自己处于最弱的一方，他们甚至不会说他们的好话，因为他们没有影响力。因此，他们会在同伴中说他们的坏话。

 Every opinion may be held preferable to life, the love of which is so strong and so natural.[74]   157  Contradiction: contempt for our existence, to die for nothing, hatred of our existence. 
每一种观点都可能比生活更好，对生活的热爱是如此强烈和自然。 [74] 157矛盾：蔑视我们的存在，白白死去，憎恨我们的存在。
  158  _Pursuits._--The charm of fame is so great, that we like every object to which it is attached, even death. 
158 _追求._--名誉的魅力是如此之大，以至于我们喜欢它所依附的每一个物体，甚至包括死亡。

 159、高尚的行为在隐藏时最受尊敬。
When I see some of these in history (as p. 
当我在历史上看到其中一些时（如第 17 页）
184)[75], they please me greatly. 
 184）[75]，他们非常令我高兴。
But after all they have not been quite hidden, since they have been known; and though people have done what they could to hide them, the little publication of them spoils all, for what was best in them was the wish to hide them. 
但毕竟它们还没有被完全隐藏起来，因为它们已经为人所知。尽管人们已经竭尽全力隐藏它们，但它们的小小公开却破坏了一切，因为它们最大的优点就是隐藏它们的愿望。
  160  Sneezing absorbs all the functions of the soul, as well as work does; but we do not draw therefrom the same conclusions against the greatness of man, because it is against his will. 
 160 打喷嚏会吸收灵魂的所有功能，就像工作一样；但我们不会从中得出同样的结论来反对人的伟大，因为这违背了他的意愿。
And although we bring it on ourselves, it is nevertheless against our will that we sneeze. 
尽管这是我们自己造成的，但我们打喷嚏却是违背我们意愿的。
It is not in view of the act itself; it is for another end. 
它不是针对行为本身；而是针对行为本身。这是为了另一个目的。
And thus it is not a proof of the weakness of man, and of his slavery under that action. 
因此，这并不能证明人的弱点，也不能证明人在这种行为下受到奴役。
 It is not disgraceful for man to yield to pain, and it is disgraceful to yield to pleasure. 
人屈从于痛苦并不可耻，屈从于快乐才是可耻的。
This is not because pain comes to us from without, and we ourselves seek pleasure; for it is possible to seek pain, and yield to it purposely, without this kind of baseness. 
这并不是因为痛苦是从外来的，我们自己寻求快乐；而是因为痛苦是从外来的。因为我们可以寻求痛苦，并有目的地屈服于它，而不需要这种卑鄙。
Whence comes it, then, that reason thinks it honourable to succumb under stress of pain, and disgraceful to yield to the attack of pleasure? It is because pain does not tempt and attract us. 
那么，理性认为在痛苦的压力下屈服是光荣的，而屈服于快乐的攻击是可耻的呢？这是因为痛苦不会诱惑和吸引我们。
It is we ourselves who choose it voluntarily, and will it to prevail over us. 
是我们自己自愿选择了它，并让它战胜了我们。
So that we are masters of the situation; and in this man yields to himself.

Now only mastery and sovereignty bring glory, and only slavery brings shame.

  161  _Vanity._--How wonderful it is that a thing so evident as the vanity of the world is so little known, that it is a strange and surprising thing to say that it is foolish to seek greatness!   162  He who will know fully the vanity of man has only to consider the causes and effects of love. 
161 _虚荣._--世界的虚荣如此明显，却鲜为人知，这是多么奇妙啊，以至于说追求伟大是愚蠢的，这是一件奇怪而令人惊讶的事情！ 162 欲知人之虚荣者，须思爱之因与果。
The cause is a _je ne sais quoi_ (Corneille),[76] and the effects are dreadful. 
原因是“je ne sais quoi_”（高乃依），[76] 其影响是可怕的。
This _je ne sais quoi_, so small an object that we cannot recognise it, agitates a whole country, princes, armies, the entire world. 
这个“je ne sais quoi”，小到我们无法辨认的物体，却震动了整个国家、王子、军队和整个世界。
 Cleopatra's nose: had it been shorter, the whole aspect of the world would have been altered.

 163 _Vanity._--爱情的原因和结果：克利奥帕特拉。
  164  He who does not see the vanity of the world is himself very vain. 
 164 看不见世间虚荣的人，他自己也是非常虚荣的。
Indeed who do not see it but youths who are absorbed in fame, diversion, and the thought of the future? But take away diversion, and you will see them dried up with weariness. 
事实上，除了那些沉迷于名声、消遣和对未来的思考的年轻人之外，谁看不到这一点呢？但除去消遣，你会发现它们因疲倦而枯竭。
They feel then their nothingness without knowing it; for it is indeed to be unhappy to be in insufferable sadness as soon as we are reduced to thinking of self, and have no diversion. 
他们在不知不觉中感到自己的虚无；因为一旦我们只顾自己，没有任何消遣，我们就会感到难以忍受的悲伤，这确实是一种不快乐。
  165  _Thoughts._--_In omnibus requiem quæsivi._[77] If our condition were truly happy, we would not need diversion from thinking of it in order to make ourselves happy. 
 165 _Thoughts._--_Inomnibus requiem quæsivi._[77] 如果我们的处境真正幸福，我们就不需要为了让自己幸福而转移对它的思考。
  166  _Diversion._--Death is easier to bear without thinking of it, than is the thought of death without peril. 
 166_转移._--不去想死亡比想到没有危险的死亡更容易忍受。
  167  The miseries of human life have established all this: as men have seen this, they have taken up diversion. 
 167 人类生活的苦难证实了这一切：人们看到这一点，就开始消遣。
  168  _Diversion._--As men are not able to fight against death, misery, ignorance, they have taken it into their heads, in order to be happy, not to think of them at all. 
 168 _转移._--由于人们无法与死亡、痛苦、无知作斗争，所以他们把它们带入头脑，以便快乐，根本不去想它们。
  169  Despite these miseries, man wishes to be happy, and only wishes to be happy, and cannot wish not to be so. 
 169 尽管有这些痛苦，人还是希望快乐，而且只希望快乐，不能希望不快乐。
But how will he set about it? To be happy he would have to make himself immortal; but, not being able to do so, it has occurred to him to prevent himself from thinking of death. 
但他将如何着手呢？为了幸福，他必须让自己永垂不朽。但是，由于无法做到这一点，他想到了要阻止自己想到死亡。
  170  _Diversion._--If man were happy, he would be the more so, the less he was diverted, like the Saints and God.--Yes; but is it not to be happy to have a faculty of being amused by diversion?--No; for that comes from elsewhere and from without, and thus is dependent, and therefore subject to be disturbed by a thousand accidents, which bring inevitable griefs. 
 170_消遣。_-如果人是快乐的，他越少被消遣，他就会越快乐，就像圣徒和上帝一样。-是的；但是，拥有一种被消遣所逗乐的能力难道不是幸福的吗？因为它来自其他地方，来自外部，因此是依赖的，因此容易受到成千上万的意外事件的干扰，从而带来不可避免的悲伤。
  171  _Misery._--The only thing which consoles us for our miseries is diversion, and yet this it the greatest of our miseries. 
 171 _Misery._--唯一能安慰我们痛苦的事情就是消遣，然而这是我们最大的痛苦。
For it is this which principally hinders us from reflecting upon ourselves, and which makes us insensibly ruin ourselves. 
因为正是这一点主要阻碍了我们反思自己，并使我们在不知不觉中毁掉了自己。
Without this we should be in a state of weariness, and this weariness would spur us to seek a more solid means of escaping from it. 
如果没有这一点，我们就会处于一种疲倦的状态，而这种疲倦会促使我们寻求更坚实的逃避方式。
But diversion amuses us, and leads us unconsciously to death. 
但消遣却让我们感到有趣，并在不知不觉中将我们引向死亡。
  172  We do not rest satisfied with the present. 
172 我们并不满足于现状。
We anticipate the future as too slow in coming, as if in order to hasten its course; or we recall the past, to stop its too rapid flight. 
我们预计未来来得太慢，仿佛是为了加快它的进程；或者我们回忆过去，以阻止其过快的飞行。
So imprudent are we that we wander in the times which are not ours, and do not think of the only one which belongs to us; and so idle are we that we dream of those times which are no more, and thoughtlessly overlook that which alone exists. 
我们是如此轻率，以至于我们在不属于我们的时代中徘徊，而没有想到唯一属于我们的时代；我们是如此无所事事，以至于我们梦想着那些已经不复存在的时代，而轻率地忽视了那些单独存在的时代。
For the present is generally painful to us. 
因为目前对我们来说通常是痛苦的。
We conceal it from our sight, because it troubles us; and if it be delightful to us, we regret to see it pass away. 
我们把它隐藏在我们的视线之外，因为它让我们烦恼；如果它让我们高兴，我们会遗憾地看到它消失。
We try to sustain it by the future, and think of arranging matters which are not in our power, for a time which we have no certainty of reaching. 
我们试图通过未来来维持它，并考虑在我们不确定能否到达的时间里安排我们无能为力的事情。
 Let each one examine his thoughts, and he will find them all occupied with the past and the future. 
让每个人检查一下他的思想，他会发现他们全都被过去和未来占据了。
We scarcely ever think of the present; and if we think of it, it is only to take light from it to arrange the future. 
我们几乎从来不考虑现在；如果我们想到这一点，也只是从中汲取灵感来安排未来。
The present is never our end. 
现在永远不是我们的终点。
The past and the present are our means; the future alone is our end.[78] So we never live, but we hope to live; and, as we are always preparing to be happy, it is inevitable we should never be so. 
过去和现在是我们的手段；唯有未来才是我们的终点。[78]所以我们从来没有生活过，但我们希望生活；而且，我们总是在为幸福做准备，但我们不可避免地永远不应该幸福。
  173  They say that eclipses foretoken misfortune, because misfortunes are common, so that, as evil happens so often, they often foretell it; whereas if they said that they predict good fortune, they would often be wrong. 
 173 他们说日食预示不幸，因为不幸是常见的，因此，由于邪恶经常发生，他们常常预言它；然而，如果他们说自己能预测好运，那么他们往往是错的。
They attribute good fortune only to rare conjunctions of the heavens; so they seldom fail in prediction. 
他们只把好运归因于罕见的天相交合；所以他们很少会预测失败。
  174  _Misery._--Solomon[79] and Job have best known and best spoken of the misery of man; the former the most fortunate, and the latter the most unfortunate of men; the former knowing the vanity of pleasures from experience, the latter the reality of evils. 
 174 _Misery._--所罗门[79]和约伯最有名，也最常谈论人类的苦难；前者是最幸运的人，后者是最不幸的人。前者从经验中认识到快乐的虚荣，后者则认识到邪恶的现实。
  175  We know ourselves so little, that many think they are about to die when they are well, and many think they are well when they are near death, unconscious of approaching fever,[80] or of the abscess ready to form itself. 
175我们对自己知之甚少，以至于许多人在健康时认为自己即将死去，许多人在濒临死亡时认为自己很好，没有意识到发烧即将来临，[80]或脓肿即将形成。
  176  Cromwell[81] was about to ravage all Christendom; the royal family was undone, and his own for ever established, save for a little grain of sand which formed in his ureter. 
 176 克伦威尔[81]即将蹂躏整个基督教世界；王室被毁灭了，而他自己的家族则永远建立起来，除了他的输尿管中形成的一小粒沙子。
Rome herself was trembling under him; but this small piece of gravel having formed there, he is dead, his family cast down, all is peaceful, and the king is restored. 
罗马本身在他的统治下颤抖；但当这小块碎石在那里形成时，他死了，他的家人倒下了，一切都平静了，国王又恢复了。
  177  [Three hosts.[82]] Would he who had possessed the friendship of the King of England, the King of Poland, and the Queen of Sweden, have believed he would lack a refuge and shelter in the world?   178  Macrobius:[83] on the innocents slain by Herod. 
 177 [三军。[82]] 拥有英国国王、波兰国王和瑞典女王友谊的人会相信他在世界上会缺乏避难所和庇护所吗？ 178 马克罗比乌斯：[83]关于被希律王杀害的无辜者。
  179  When Augustus learnt that Herod's own son was amongst the infants under two years of age, whom he had caused to be slain, he said that it was better to be Herod's pig than his son.--Macrobius, _Sat._, book ii, chap. 
179 当奥古斯都得知希律亲生的儿子是他造成的两岁以下婴儿之一时，他说，做希律的猪比做他的儿子更好。--马克罗比乌斯，周六，第二卷，第一章。

  180  The great and the humble have the same misfortunes, the same griefs, the same passions;[84] but the one is at the top of the wheel, and the other near the centre, and so less disturbed by the same revolutions. 
 180 伟大的人和卑微的人有同样的不幸，同样的悲伤，同样的激情；[84]但一个位于轮子的顶部，另一个靠近中心，因此受到相同革命的干扰较小。
  181  We are so unfortunate that we can only take pleasure in a thing on condition of being annoyed if it turn out ill, as a thousand things can do, and do every hour. 
 181 我们是如此不幸，我们只能对一件事感到高兴，但如果它结果不好，我们就会感到恼火，就像一千件事可以做的那样，而且每小时都会做。
He who should find the secret of rejoicing in the good, without troubling himself with its contrary evil, would have hit the mark. 
如果一个人能够找到以善为乐的秘诀，而不用相反的恶来困扰自己，那么他就达到了目的。
It is perpetual motion. 
这是永动机。
  182  Those who have always good hope in the midst of misfortunes, and who are delighted with good luck, are suspected of being very pleased with the ill success of the affair, if they are not equally distressed by bad luck; and they are overjoyed to find these pretexts of hope, in order to show that they are concerned and to conceal by the joy which they feign to feel that which they have at seeing the failure of the matter. 
182 那些在不幸中总是抱有美好希望并因幸运而感到高兴的人，如果他们不同样为不幸而感到痛苦，那么他们就会被怀疑对事情的不幸成功感到非常高兴。他们欣喜若狂地找到了这些希望的借口，以表明他们的关心，并用他们假装看到事情失败时的喜悦来掩饰自己的担忧。
  183  We run carelessly to the precipice, after we have put something before us to prevent us seeing it. 
 183 当我们把某样东西放在我们面前以防止我们看到它之后，我们就漫不经心地跑向悬崖。
    SECTION III  OF THE NECESSITY OF THE WAGER   184  A letter to incite to the search after God. 
第三节赌注的必要性 184 一封煽动人们寻求上帝的信。
 And then to make people seek Him among the philosophers, sceptics, and dogmatists, who disquiet him who inquires of them. 
然后让人们在哲学家、怀疑论者和教条主义者中寻找他，这些人使询问他们的人感到不安。
  185  The conduct of God, who disposes all things kindly, is to put religion into the mind by reason, and into the heart by grace. 
 185 仁慈地安排万事的真主的作为，就是用理性将宗教置于头脑中，用恩典将宗教置于心中。
But to will to put it into the mind and heart by force and threats is not to put religion there, but terror, _terorrem potius quam religionem_. 
但是，通过武力和威胁将其植入思想和内心并不是将宗教放在那里，而是恐怖，_terorrem potius quam宗教_。
  186  _Nisi terrerentur et non docerentur, improba quasi dominatio videretur_ (Aug., Ep. 
第 186 章
48 or 49), _Contra Mendacium ad Consentium_. 
48 或 49），_Contra Mendacium ad Consentium_。
  187  _Order._--Men despise religion; they hate it, and fear it is true. 
 187 _Order._--人们鄙视宗教；他们讨厌它，并担心这是真的。
To remedy this, we must begin by showing that religion is not contrary to reason; that it is venerable, to inspire respect for it; then we must make it lovable, to make good men hope it is true; finally, we must prove it is true. 
为了解决这个问题，我们必须首先表明宗教并不违背理性；相反，宗教并不违背理性。它是值得尊敬的，激发人们对它的尊重；然后我们必须让它变得可爱，让好人希望它是真的；最后，我们必须证明这是真的。
 Venerable, because it has perfect knowledge of man; lovable, because it promises the true good. 
可敬，是因为它对人有圆满的认识；可爱，因为它承诺真正的美好。
"  188  In every dialogue and discourse, we must be able to say to those who take offence, ""Of what do you complain?""   189  To begin by pitying unbelievers; they are wretched enough by their condition. "
 188 在每一次对话和谈话中，我们必须能够对那些冒犯的人说：“你抱怨什么？” 189、首先要怜悯不信者；他们的处境已经够悲惨的了。
We ought only to revile them where it is beneficial; but this does them harm. 
我们只应该在有益的地方谩骂他们；但这对他们有害。
  190  To pity atheists who seek, for are they not unhappy enough? To inveigh against those who make a boast of it. 
190 怜悯那些寻求的无神论者，因为他们还不够不幸吗？猛烈抨击那些自夸的人。
  191  And will this one scoff at the other? Who ought to scoff? And yet, the latter does not scoff at the other, but pities him. 
第191章 这一个会嘲笑另一个吗？谁应该嘲笑？然而，后者并没有嘲笑对方，而是怜悯他。
  192  To reproach Miton[85] with not being troubled, since God will reproach him. 
 192 责备米通[85]不被困扰，因为上帝会责备他。
  193  _Quid fiet hominibus qui minima contemnunt, majora non credunt?_   194  ... 
第193章 194、第194章
Let them at least learn what is the religion they attack, before attacking it. 
在攻击之前，至少让他们了解他们所攻击的宗教是什么。
If this religion boasted of having a clear view of God, and of possessing it open and unveiled, it would be attacking it to say that we see nothing in the world which shows it with this clearness. 
如果这个宗教吹嘘自己对上帝有清晰的认识，并且拥有公开的和未揭露的上帝的观点，那么说我们在世界上看不到任何东西可以如此清晰地显示上帝，那就是对它的攻击。
But since, on the contrary, it says that men are in darkness and estranged from God, that He has hidden Himself from their knowledge, that this is in fact the name which He gives Himself in the Scriptures, _Deus absconditus_;[86] and finally, if it endeavours equally to establish these two things: that God has set up in the Church visible signs to make Himself known to those who should seek Him sincerely, and that He has nevertheless so disguised them that He will only be perceived by those who seek Him with all their heart; what advantage can they obtain, when, in the negligence with which they make profession of being in search of the truth, they cry out that nothing reveals it to them; and since that darkness in which they are, and with which they upbraid the Church, establishes only one of the things which she affirms, without touching the other, and, very far from destroying, proves her doctrine?  In order to attack it, they should have protested that they had made every effort to seek Him everywhere, and even in that which the Church proposes for their instruction, but without satisfaction. 
但相反，它说人处于黑暗之中，与上帝疏远，上帝将自己隐藏起来，不让他们知道，这实际上是上帝在圣经中给自己起的名字，_Deus Abconditus_；[86]并且最后，如果它同样努力确立这两件事：神在教会中设立了可见的记号，让那些真诚寻求他的人认识他自己，但他又将这些记号隐藏起来，只有那些人才能认识他。他们全心全意地寻求他；当他们声称自己在寻求真理时，他们大意疏忽，却大声疾呼没有任何东西向他们揭示真理，那么他们能得到什么好处呢？既然他们所处的黑暗，以及他们用来谴责教会的黑暗，只确立了教会所确认的其中一件事，而没有触及另一件事，而且远非毁灭，而是证明了她的教义？为了攻击它，他们应该抗议说，他们已尽一切努力到处寻找他，甚至在教会建议他们指导的地方，但仍不满意。
If they talked in this manner, they would in truth be attacking one of her pretensions. 
如果他们这样说话，其实就是在攻击她的一个借口。
But I hope here to show that no reasonable person can speak thus, and I venture even to say that no one has ever done so. 
但我希望在这里表明，没有一个有理智的人可以这样说话，我什至斗胆说，从来没有人这样做过。
We know well enough how those who are of this mind behave. 
我们非常清楚那些有这种想法的人的行为方式。
They believe they have made great efforts for their instruction, when they have spent a few hours in reading some book of Scripture, and have questioned some priest on the truths of the faith. 
当他们花了几个小时阅读一些圣经书籍，并向一些牧师询问信仰的真理时，他们相信自己已经为指导付出了巨大的努力。
After that, they boast of having made vain search in books and among men. 
此后，他们吹嘘自己在书本和人中进行了徒劳的搜索。
But, verily, I will tell them what I have often said, that this negligence is insufferable. 
但是，说实话，我会告诉他们我经常说的话，这种疏忽是令人难以忍受的。
We are not here concerned with the trifling interests of some stranger, that we should treat it in this fashion; the matter concerns ourselves and our all. 
我们在这里关心的并不是某个陌生人的琐碎利益，我们应该以这种方式对待它；这件事关系到我们自己和我们所有人。
 The immortality of the soul is a matter which is of so great consequence to us, and which touches us so profoundly, that we must have lost all feeling to be indifferent as to knowing what it is. 
灵魂的不朽对我们来说意义重大，对我们的触动如此深刻，以至于我们一定已经失去了对灵魂不朽的漠不关心的感觉。
All our actions and thoughts must take such different courses, according as there are or are not eternal joys to hope for, that it is impossible to take one step with sense and judgment, unless we regulate our course by our view of this point which ought to be our ultimate end. 
我们所有的行动和思想都必须采取不同的路线，根据是否有永恒的快乐来希望，不可能凭感觉和判断迈出一步，除非我们根据我们对这一点的看法来调整我们的路线，而这一点应该是我们所希望的。成为我们的最终目的。
 Thus our first interest and our first duty is to enlighten ourselves on this subject, whereon depends all our conduct. 
因此，我们的首要兴趣和首要义务就是在这个主题上启发我们自己，这是我们所有行为的基础。
Therefore among those who do not believe, I make a vast difference between those who strive with all their power to inform themselves, and those who live without troubling or thinking about it. 
因此，在那些不相信的人中，我对那些竭尽全力去了解自己的人和那些生活中没有烦恼或不思考的人做出了巨大的区别。
 I can have only compassion for those who sincerely bewail their doubt, who regard it as the greatest of misfortunes, and who, sparing no effort to escape it, make of this inquiry their principal and most serious occupations. 
我只能对那些真诚地为自己的怀疑而哀叹的人表示同情，他们认为这是最大的不幸，并且不遗余力地逃避它，并把这种探究作为他们主要和最严肃的工作。
 But as for those who pass their life without thinking of this ultimate end of life, and who, for this sole reason that they do not find within themselves the lights which convince them of it, neglect to seek them elsewhere, and to examine thoroughly whether this opinion is one of those which people receive with credulous simplicity, or one of those which, although obscure in themselves, have nevertheless a solid and immovable foundation, I look upon them in a manner quite different. 
但对于那些度过一生却没有想到生命最终目的的人来说，他们仅仅因为在自己内心找不到使他们相信这一点的光明，就忽略了在别处寻找它们，并彻底检查是否存在。这种观点是人们轻信简单地接受的观点之一，或者是虽然本身晦涩难懂，但却具有坚实和不可动摇的基础的观点之一，但我以一种截然不同的方式看待它们。
 This carelessness in a matter which concerns themselves, their eternity, their all, moves me more to anger than pity; it astonishes and shocks me; it is to me monstrous. 
这种在关系到他们自己、他们的永恒、他们的一切的事情上的粗心大意，让我更多地感到愤怒而不是怜悯。这让我感到惊讶和震撼；这对我来说是可怕的。
I do not say this out of the pious zeal of a spiritual devotion. 
我这么说并不是出于精神奉献的虔诚热情。
I expect, on the contrary, that we ought to have this feeling from principles of human interest and self-love; for this we need only see what the least enlightened persons see. 
相反，我期望我们应该出于人类利益和自爱的原则而拥有这种感觉；为此，我们只需要看到最不开明的人所看到的。
 We do not require great education of the mind to understand that here is no real and lasting satisfaction; that our pleasures are only vanity; that our evils are infinite; and, lastly, that death, which threatens us every moment, must infallibly place us within a few years under the dreadful necessity of being for ever either annihilated or unhappy. 
我们不需要接受很好的心灵教育就能明白，这里并不存在真正的、持久的满足；我们需要的是一种满足感。我们的快乐只是虚空；我们的罪恶是无限的；最后，死亡每时每刻都在威胁着我们，它必然会在几年之内使我们陷入永远毁灭或不幸的可怕境地。
 There is nothing more real than this, nothing more terrible. 
没有什么比这更真实、更可怕的了。
Be we as heroic as we like, that is the end which awaits the noblest life in the world. 
无论我们多么英雄，这就是等待世界上最高尚生活的结局。
Let us reflect on this, and then say whether it is not beyond doubt that there is no good in this life but in the hope of another; that we are happy only in proportion as we draw near it; and that, as there are no more woes for those who have complete assurance of eternity, so there is no more happiness for those who have no insight into it. 
让我们思考一下这一点，然后说，是否毫无疑问，今生没有美好的事物，只有在来生的希望中？我们幸福的程度与我们接近它的程度成正比；正如那些对永恒有完全把握的人来说，不再有苦难一样，对于那些没有洞察力的人来说，也不再有幸福。
 Surely then it is a great evil thus to be in doubt, but it is at least an indispensable duty to seek when we are in such doubt; and thus the doubter who does not seek is altogether completely unhappy and completely wrong. 
当然，这样的怀疑是一种极大的罪恶，但当我们有这样的怀疑时，去寻求至少是一种不可或缺的责任。因此，不寻求的怀疑者是完全不快乐和完全错误的。
And if besides this he is easy and content, professes to be so, and indeed boasts of it; if it is this state itself which is the subject of his joy and vanity, I have no words to describe so silly a creature. 
除此之外，如果他是个随和、知足的人，他自称是这样，而且确实以此为豪；如果这种状态本身就是他的快乐和虚荣的主题，那么我无法用言语来形容如此愚蠢的生物。
" How can people hold these opinions? What joy can we find in the expectation of nothing but hopeless misery? What reason for boasting that we are in impenetrable darkness? And how can it happen that the following argument occurs to a reasonable man?  ""I know not who put me into the world, nor what the world is, nor what I myself am. "
人们怎么能持有这些观点呢？期待除了无望的苦难之外什么也没有，我们能找到什么快乐呢？有什么理由夸耀我们处于无法穿透的黑暗之中呢？一个有理智的人怎么可能会想到下面的论点呢？ “我不知道是谁把我带到这个世界上，也不知道这个世界是什么，也不知道我自己是什么。
I am in terrible ignorance of everything. 
我对一切都一无所知。
I know not what my body is, nor my senses, nor my soul, not even that part of me which thinks what I say, which reflects on all and on itself, and knows itself no more than the rest. 
我不知道我的身体是什么，也不知道我的感官，也不知道我的灵魂，甚至不知道我的那一部分，它思考我所说的话，反思一切和自身，并且并不比其他部分更了解自己。
I see those frightful spaces of the universe which surround me, and I find myself tied to one corner of this vast expanse, without knowing why I am put in this place rather than in another, nor why the short time which is given me to live is assigned to me at this point rather than at another of the whole eternity which was before me or which shall come after me. 
我看到宇宙中那些可怕的空间围绕着我，我发现自己被绑在这片浩瀚宇宙的一个角落，不知道为什么我被放在这个地方而不是另一个地方，也不知道为什么我的生命如此短暂是在此时此刻分配给我的，而不是在我之前或之后的整个永恒的另一个时刻。
I see nothing but infinites on all sides, which surround me as an atom, and as a shadow which endures only for an instant and returns no more. 
我只看到四面八方的无限，它们像一个原子一样围绕着我，像一个只持续片刻就不再返回的影子。
All I know is that I must soon die, but what I know least is this very death which I cannot escape. 
我只知道我很快就会死去，但我最不知道的是我无法逃脱这种死亡。
" ""As I know not whence I come, so I know not whither I go. "
 “正如我不知道我从哪里来，同样我也不知道我要往哪里去。
I know only that, in leaving this world, I fall for ever either into annihilation or into the hands of an angry God, without knowing to which of these two states I shall be for ever assigned. 
我只知道，在离开这个世界时，我要么永远陷入毁灭，要么落入愤怒的上帝手中，而不知道我将永远被分配到这两种状态中的哪一种。
Such is my state, full of weakness and uncertainty. 
这就是我的状态，充满了软弱和不确定性。
And from all this I conclude that I ought to spend all the days of my life without caring to inquire into what must happen to me. 
从这一切我得出的结论是，我应该度过我一生的每一天，而不去关心探究我身上会发生什么。
"Perhaps I might find some solution to my doubts, but I will not take the trouble, nor take a step to seek it; and after treating with scorn those who are concerned with this care, I will go without foresight and without fear to try the great event, and let myself be led carelessly to death, uncertain of the eternity of my future state.""  Who would desire to have for a friend a man who talks in this fashion? Who would choose him out from others to tell him of his affairs? Who would have recourse to him in affliction? And indeed to what use in life could one put him?  In truth, it is the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable: and their opposition to it is so little dangerous that it serves on the contrary to establish its truths. "
也许我可以找到一些解决我的疑虑的方法，但我不会不厌其烦，也不会采取行动去寻求它；在蔑视那些关心这种关心的人之后，我将毫无远见、无所畏惧地去尝试伟大的事件，让自己不小心被引导至死亡，不确定我未来状态的永恒。”有一个这样说话的人作为朋友吗？谁会从其他人中挑选他来告诉他他的事情？谁会在苦难中求助于他？事实上，一个人在生活中能有什么用处？事实上，宗教的荣耀在于拥有如此无理取闹的人作为敌人：他们对宗教的反对几乎没有什么危险，相反它有助于确立宗教的真理。
For the Christian faith goes mainly to establish these two facts, the corruption of nature, and redemption by Jesus Christ. 
因为基督教信仰主要是为了确立这两个事实：自然的败坏和耶稣基督的救赎。
Now I contend that if these men do not serve to prove the truth of the redemption by the holiness of their behaviour, they at least serve admirably to show the corruption of nature by sentiments so unnatural. 
现在我认为，如果这些人不能通过他们的行为的圣洁来证明救赎的真理，那么他们至少令人钦佩地通过如此不自然的情感来展示自然的腐败。
 Nothing is so important to man as his own state, nothing is so formidable to him as eternity; and thus it is not natural that there should be men indifferent to the loss of their existence, and to the perils of everlasting suffering. 
对人来说，没有什么比他自己的状态更重要的了，没有什么比永恒对他更令人畏惧的了。因此，有人对自己的生存丧失和永远受苦的危险漠不关心，这是不自然的。
They are quite different with regard to all other things. 
它们在所有其他方面都非常不同。
They are afraid of mere trifles; they foresee them; they feel them. 
他们害怕小事；他们预见到了他们；他们感觉到了。
And this same man who spends so many days and nights in rage and despair for the loss of office, or for some imaginary insult to his honour, is the very one who knows without anxiety and without emotion that he will lose all by death. 
而这个为失去公职或为某种想象中的对他的荣誉的侮辱而花费了如此多的日日夜夜的愤怒和绝望的人，却毫无焦虑和情感地知道，他将因死亡而失去一切。
It is a monstrous thing to see in the same heart and at the same time this sensibility to trifles and this strange insensibility to the greatest objects. 
在同一颗心中同时看到对琐事的敏感和对最伟大事物的奇怪麻木不仁，这是一件可怕的事情。
It is an incomprehensible enchantment, and a supernatural slumber, which indicates as its cause an all-powerful force. 
这是一种难以理解的魔力，一种超自然的沉睡，表明其原因是一种全能的力量。
 There must be a strange confusion in the nature of man, that he should boast of being in that state in which it seems incredible that a single individual should be. 
人的本性一定存在一种奇怪的混乱，他竟然会夸耀自己所处的状态，而单个个体应该处于这种状态似乎令人难以置信。
However, experience has shown me so great a number of such persons that the fact would be surprising, if we did not know that the greater part of those who trouble themselves about the matter are disingenuous, and not in fact what they say. 
然而，经验告诉我，这样的人数量如此之多，如果我们不知道那些为此事烦恼的人中的大部分都是不诚实的，而且事实上并不是他们所说的那样，那么这一事实就会令人惊讶。
They are people who have heard it said that it is the fashion to be thus daring. 
他们是听人说过这样大胆的人是时尚的人。
It is what they call shaking off the yoke, and they try to imitate this. 
这就是他们所说的摆脱枷锁，他们试图模仿这一点。
But it would not be difficult to make them understand how greatly they deceive themselves in thus seeking esteem. 
但要让他们明白，在寻求尊重的过程中，他们是多么自欺欺人，这并不困难。
This is not the way to gain it, even I say among those men of the world who take a healthy view of things, and who know that the only way to succeed in this life is to make ourselves appear honourable, faithful, judicious, and capable of useful service to a friend; because naturally men love only what may be useful to them. 
即使我对那些对事物抱有健康看法的人来说，这也不是获得它的方法，他们知道今生成功的唯一方法就是让自己显得诚实、忠诚、明智和明智。能够为朋友提供有用的服务；因为男人自然只喜欢对他们有用的东西。
Now, what do we gain by hearing it said of a man that he has now thrown off the yoke, that he does not believe there is a God who watches our actions, that he considers himself the sole master of his conduct, and that he thinks he is accountable for it only to himself? Does he think that he has thus brought us to have henceforth complete confidence in him, and to look to him for consolation, advice, and help in every need of life? Do they profess to have delighted us by telling us that they hold our soul to be only a little wind and smoke, especially by telling us this in a haughty and self-satisfied tone of voice? Is this a thing to say gaily? Is it not, on the contrary, a thing to say sadly, as the saddest thing in the world?  If they thought of it seriously, they would see that this is so bad a mistake, so contrary to good sense, so opposed to decency and so removed in every respect from that good breeding which they seek, that they would be more likely to correct than to pervert those who had an inclination to follow them. 
现在，当我们听到一个人说他现在已经摆脱了枷锁，他不相信有一位上帝在监视我们的行为，他认为自己是他行为的唯一主人，并且他认为自己是他的行为的唯一主人时，我们得到了什么？认为他只对自己负责？他是否认为他让我们从此对他充满信心，并在生活的每一个需要时向他寻求安慰、建议和帮助？他们是否自称让我们高兴，告诉我们他们认为我们的灵魂只是一点风和烟，尤其是以一种傲慢和自鸣得意的语气告诉我们这一点？这有什么好说的吗？相反，这难道不是一件可悲的事情，是世界上最悲伤的事情吗？如果他们认真思考一下，就会发现这是一个严重的错误，违背了良好的判断力，违背了正派，在各方面都背离了他们所寻求的良好教养，因此他们更有可能纠正。而不是去歪曲那些有追随他们倾向的人。
And indeed, make them give an account of their opinions, and of the reasons which they have for doubting religion, and they will say to you things so feeble and so petty, that they will persuade you of the contrary. 
事实上，如果让他们陈述自己的观点，以及他们怀疑宗教的理由，他们就会对你说一些如此无力和琐碎的事情，以至于他们会说服你相反的观点。
"The following is what a person one day said to such a one very appositely: ""If you continue to talk in this manner, you will really make me religious."" And he was right, for who would not have a horror of holding opinions in which he would have such contemptible persons as companions!  Thus those who only feign these opinions would be very unhappy, if they restrained their natural feelings in order to make themselves the most conceited of men. "
以下是有一天一个人对这样的人说的话，非常贴切：“如果你继续这样说话，你真的会让我变得虔诚。”他是对的，因为如果他持有这样的观点，而他却与如此可鄙的人为友，谁会不感到恐惧呢！因此，那些假装这些观点的人，如果为了使自己成为最自负的人而克制自己的自然感情，就会非常不高兴。
If, at the bottom of their heart, they are troubled at not having more light, let them not disguise the fact; this avowal will not be shameful. 
如果他们内心深处因没有更多的亮光而感到困扰，让他们不要隐瞒事实；这种承认不会是可耻的。
The only shame is to have none. 
唯一的耻辱是没有。
Nothing reveals more an extreme weakness of mind than not to know the misery of a godless man. 
没有什么比不知道一个不敬虔的人的痛苦更能暴露出心灵的极度软弱了。
Nothing is more indicative of a bad disposition of heart than not to desire the truth of eternal promises. 
没有什么比不渴望永恒应许的真理更能表明内心的不良倾向了。
Nothing is more dastardly than to act with bravado before God. 
没有什么比在上帝面前虚张声势更卑鄙的了。
Let them then leave these impieties to those who are sufficiently ill-bred to be really capable of them. 
那么就让他们把这些不敬行为留给那些没有教养、真正有能力这样做的人吧。
Let them at least be honest men, if they cannot be Christians. 
如果他们不能成为基督徒，至少让他们成为诚实的人。
Finally, let them recognise that there are two kinds of people one can call reasonable; those who serve God with all their heart because they know Him, and those who seek Him with all their heart because they do not know Him. 
最后，让他们认识到有两种人可以称之为理性的人：那些全心事奉神的人，因为他们认识神；那些人全心寻求神，因为他们不认识神。
 But as for those who live without knowing Him and without seeking Him, they judge themselves so little worthy of their own care, that they are not worthy of the care of others; and it needs all the charity of the religion which they despise, not to despise them even to the point of leaving them to their folly. 
但对于那些不认识他、不寻求他的人来说，他们认为自己不值得自己照顾，也不值得别人照顾；他们认为自己不值得别人照顾。它需要他们所鄙视的宗教的全部仁慈，而不是鄙视他们，甚至让他们陷入愚蠢的境地。
But because this religion obliges us always to regard them, so long as they are in this life, as capable of the grace which can enlighten them, and to believe that they may, in a little time, be more replenished with faith than we are, and that, on the other hand, we may fall into the blindness wherein they are, we must do for them what we would they should do for us if we were in their place, and call upon them to have pity upon themselves, and to take at least some steps in the endeavour to find light. 
但是，因为这种宗教迫使我们始终将他们视为有能力启发他们的恩典，只要他们还活着，并相信他们可能在不久的时间里比我们更充满信仰另一方面，我们可能会陷入他们的盲目性，我们必须为他们做我们希望他们为我们做的事情，如果我们处于他们的位置，并呼吁他们怜悯自己，并且至少采取一些步骤来努力寻找光明。
Let them give to reading this some of the hours which they otherwise employ so uselessly; whatever aversion they may bring to the task, they will perhaps gain something, and at least will not lose much. 
让他们花一些时间来阅读这篇文章，否则他们会毫无用处。无论他们对这项任务有什么厌恶，他们也许会有所收获，至少不会失去太多。
But as for those who bring to the task perfect sincerity and a real desire to meet with truth, those I hope will be satisfied and convinced of the proofs of a religion so divine, which I have here collected, and in which I have followed somewhat after this order ... 
但对于那些带着完美的诚意和真正渴望接触真理的人来说，我希望那些人能够满足并相信我在这里收集的如此神圣的宗教的证据，并且我在其中有所遵循在这个命令之后...
  195  Before entering into the proofs of the Christian religion, I find it necessary to point out the sinfulness of those men who live in indifference to the search for truth in a matter which is so important to them, and which touches them so nearly. 
195 在进入基督教的证据之前，我发现有必要指出那些生活在对他们如此重要且与他们如此密切相关的事情上寻求真理漠不关心的人的罪孽。
 Of all their errors, this doubtless is the one which most convicts them of foolishness and blindness, and in which it is easiest to confound them by the first glimmerings of common sense, and by natural feelings. 
在他们所有的错误中，这无疑是最让他们犯下愚蠢和盲目的错误，而且最容易被常识和自然感情的最初曙光所迷惑。
 For it is not to be doubted that the duration of this life is but a moment; that the state of death is eternal, whatever may be its nature; and that thus all our actions and thoughts must take such different directions according to the state of that eternity, that it is impossible to take one step with sense and judgment, unless we regulate our course by the truth of that point which ought to be our ultimate end. 
因为毫无疑问，此生的持续时间不过是片刻；死亡的状态是永恒的，无论其性质如何；因此，我们所有的行动和思想都必须根据永恒的状态采取不同的方向，以至于不可能凭感觉和判断迈出一步，除非我们根据应该是我们的那一点的真理来调节我们的路线。最终的结局。
 There is nothing clearer than this; and thus, according to the principles of reason, the conduct of men is wholly unreasonable, if they do not take another course. 
没有什么比这更清楚的了；因此，根据理性原则，如果人们不采取其他做法，他们的行为就是完全不合理的。
 On this point, therefore, we condemn those who live without thought of the ultimate end of life, who let themselves be guided by their own inclinations and their own pleasures without reflection and without concern, and, as if they could annihilate eternity by turning away their thought from it, think only of making themselves happy for the moment. 
因此，在这一点上，我们谴责那些不考虑生命最终目的而生活的人，他们让自己被自己的倾向和自己的快乐所引导，而不进行反思和关心，似乎只要转身就可以消灭永恒。他们的想法，只想着让自己暂时快乐。
 Yet this eternity exists, and death, which must open into it, and threatens them every hour, must in a little time infallibly put them under the dreadful necessity of being either annihilated or unhappy for ever, without knowing which of these eternities is for ever prepared for them. 
然而这种永恒是存在的，而死亡，必须向它敞开，并且每时每刻都在威胁着他们，必须在很短的时间内无误地将他们置于可怕的必然之下，要么被消灭，要么永远不快乐，而不知道这些永恒中哪一个是永远的。为他们准备的。
 This is a doubt of terrible consequence. 
这是一个会带来可怕后果的怀疑。
They are in peril of eternal woe; and thereupon, as if the matter were not worth the trouble, they neglect to inquire whether this is one of those opinions which people receive with too credulous a facility, or one of those which, obscure in themselves, have a very firm, though hidden, foundation. 
他们正处于永远祸患的危险之中；于是，好像这件事不值得费心似的，他们忽略了询问这是否是人们过于轻信的观点之一，或者是那些本身晦涩难懂、虽然隐藏但非常坚定的观点之一。 ， 基础。
Thus they know not whether there be truth or falsity in the matter, nor whether there be strength or weakness in the proofs. 
因此，他们不知道事情的真假，也不知道证据的强弱。
They have them before their eyes; they refuse to look at them; and in that ignorance they choose all that is necessary to fall into this misfortune if it exists, to await death to make trial of it, yet to be very content in this state, to make profession of it, and indeed to boast of it. 
他们就在眼前；他们拒绝看他们；在这种无知中，他们选择了陷入这种不幸（如果这种不幸存在的话）所必需的一切，等待死亡来考验它，但又非常满足于这种状态，承认它，甚至夸耀它。
Can we think seriously on the importance of this subject without being horrified at conduct so extravagant?  This resting in ignorance is a monstrous thing, and they who pass their life in it must be made to feel its extravagance and stupidity, by having it shown to them, so that they may be confounded by the sight of their folly. 
我们能否认真思考这个主题的重要性，而不会对如此奢侈的行为感到震惊？这种安息在无知中是一件可怕的事情，必须让那些在其中度过一生的人感受到它的奢侈和愚蠢，让他们看到它，这样他们就会因看到自己的愚蠢而感到困惑。
For this is how men reason, when they choose to live in such ignorance of what they are, and without seeking enlightenment. 
因为这就是人们的推理方式，当他们选择生活在对自己的本质如此无知且不寻求启迪的情况下时。
I know not, they say ... 
我不知道，他们说……
  196  Men lack heart; they would not make a friend of it. 
 196、人无心，人无心。他们不会与它成为朋友。
  197  To be insensible to the extent of despising interesting things, and to become insensible to the point which interests us most. 
 197 麻木到对有趣的事情不屑一顾，麻木到我们最感兴趣的地步。
  198  The sensibility of man to trifles, and his insensibility to great things, indicates a strange inversion. 
 198 人对小事敏感，而对大事麻木不仁，这表明了一种奇怪的颠倒。
  199  Let us imagine a number of men in chains, and all condemned to death, where some are killed each day in the sight of the others, and those who remain see their own fate in that of their fellows, and wait their turn, looking at each other sorrowfully and without hope. 
199 让我们想象一下，有许多人戴着锁链，全都被判处死刑，其中每天都有一些人在其他人的眼前被杀，而那些留下来的人则在同伴的命运中看到了自己的命运，等待轮到自己，看着彼此悲伤且没有希望。
It is an image of the condition of men. 
这是男人处境的形象。
  200  A man in a dungeon, ignorant whether his sentence be pronounced, and having only one hour to learn it, but this hour enough, if he know that it is pronounced, to obtain its repeal, would act unnaturally in spending that hour, not in ascertaining his sentence, but in playing piquet. 
 200 一个人在地牢里，不知道他的判决是否被宣布，并且只有一个小时来学习它，但是如果他知道它被宣布了，这个小时就足够了，以实现其废除，在度过这一小时时会表现得不自然，而不是确定他的判决，但玩皮奎特。
So it is against nature that man, etc. 
因此，人等是违反自然的。
It is making heavy the hand of God. 
它使上帝的手变得沉重。
 Thus not only the zeal of those who seek Him proves God, but also the blindness of those who seek Him not. 
因此，不仅那些寻求他的人的热心证明了上帝，而且那些不寻求他的人的盲目也证明了上帝。
  201  All the objections of this one and that one only go against themselves, and not against religion. 
 201 此一彼一的所有反对意见，都只是反对他们自己，而非反对宗教。
All that infidels say ... 
异教徒所说的一切...
  202  [From those who are in despair at being without faith, we see that God does not enlighten them; but as to the rest, we see there is a God who makes them blind.]   203  _Fascinatio nugacitatis._[87]--That passion may not harm us, let us act as if we had only eight hours to live. 
202 【从那些因无信而绝望的人身上看到神不开启他们，神不开启他们； ] 203 _Fascinatio nugacitatis._[87]-这种激情可能不会伤害我们，让我们表现得好像我们只剩下八个小时的生命一样。
  204  If we ought to devote eight hours of life, we ought to devote a hundred years. 
 204 如果我们应该奉献八个小时的生命，我们就应该奉献一百年。
  205  When I consider the short duration of my life, swallowed up in the eternity before and after, the little space which I fill, and even can see, engulfed in the infinite immensity of spaces of which I am ignorant, and which know me not, I am frightened, and am astonished at being here rather than there; for there is no reason why here rather than there, why now rather than then. 
 205当我想到我生命的短暂，被前后的永恒所吞没时，我所充满的、甚至能看到的那一点空间，被我所无知、不认识我的无限广阔的空间所吞没，我感到害怕，并惊讶于在这里而不是在那里；因为没有理由选择在这里而不是那里，为什么现在而不是那时。
Who has put me here? By whose order and direction have this place and time been allotted to me? _Memoria hospitis unius diei prætereuntis._[88]   206  The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me. 
是谁把我放在这里的？这个地点和时间是按照谁的命令和指示分配给我的？ _Memoria hospitis unius diei prætereuntis._[88] 206 这些无限空间的永恒寂静让我感到害怕。
  207  How many kingdoms know us not!   208  Why is my knowledge limited? Why my stature? Why my life to one hundred years rather than to a thousand? What reason has nature had for giving me such, and for choosing this number rather than another in the infinity of those from which there is no more reason to choose one than another, trying nothing else?   209  Art thou less a slave by being loved and favoured by thy master? Thou art indeed well off, slave. 
第207章 有多少王国不认识我们！第208章 为什么我的知识有限？为什么我的身材？为什么我的寿命是一百岁而不是一千年？大自然有什么理由给我这样的数字，并在无穷无尽的数字中选择这个数字而不是另一个数字，因为没有更多的理由从中选择一个而不是另一个？第209章 被主人宠爱，难道就少了一个奴隶吗？你确实过得很好，奴隶。
Thy master favours thee; he will soon beat thee. 
你的主人眷顾你；他很快就会打败你。
  210  The last act is tragic, however happy all the rest of the play is; at the last a little earth is thrown upon our head, and that is the end for ever. 
 210、不管剧的其余部分多么幸福，最后一幕都是悲剧；最后，一个小土被扔到我们头上，那就是永远的终结。
  211  We are fools to depend upon the society of our fellow-men. 
 211 我们愚蠢地依赖同胞社会。
Wretched as we are, powerless as we are, they will not aid us; we shall die alone. 
尽管我们多么可怜，尽管我们无能为力，他们也不会帮助我们；我们将孤独地死去。
We should therefore act as if we were alone, and in that case should we build fine houses, etc.? We should seek the truth without hesitation; and, if we refuse it, we show that we value the esteem of men more than the search for truth. 
因此，我们应该表现得好像我们是孤独的，那么我们应该建造漂亮的房子等等吗？我们应该毫不犹豫地寻求真理；如果我们拒绝它，就表明我们更看重人们的尊重，而不是对真理的追求。
  212  _Instability._[89]--It is a horrible thing to feel all that we possess slipping away. 
 212 _不稳定._[89]--感觉我们所拥有的一切正在溜走，这是一件可怕的事情。
  213  Between us and heaven or hell there is only life, which is the frailest thing in the world. 
 213 我们与天堂或地狱之间只有生命，生命是世界上最脆弱的东西。
  214  _Injustice._--That presumption should be joined to meanness is extreme injustice. 
 214 _Injustice._--将推定与卑鄙结合起来是极端的不公正。
  215  To fear death without danger, and not in danger, for one must be a man. 
 215 不怕死，无险，无险，必为人。
  216  Sudden death alone is feared; hence confessors stay with lords. 
 216、唯恐骤死；因此，忏悔者会留在领主身边。
  217  An heir finds the title-deeds of his house. 
 217 继承人找到了他房屋的产权证。
"Will he say, ""Perhaps they are forged?"" and neglect to examine them?   218  _Dungeon._--I approve of not examining the opinion of Copernicus; but this...! It concerns all our life to know whether the soul be mortal or immortal. "
他会说：“也许它们是伪造的？”却忽略了检查它们？ 218_Dungeon._--我赞成不审查哥白尼的观点；但是这个...！了解灵魂是会朽坏的还是不朽的，这关系到我们一生。
  219  It is certain that the mortality or immortality of the soul must make an entire difference to morality. 
219 可以肯定的是，灵魂的必死或不朽必然对道德产生完全的影响。
And yet philosophers have constructed their ethics independently of this: they discuss to pass an hour. 
然而哲学家们却独立地构建了他们的伦理学：他们讨论如何打发一个小时。
 Plato, to incline to Christianity. 
柏拉图，倾向于基督教。
  220  The fallacy of philosophers who have not discussed the immortality of the soul. 
 220 没有讨论灵魂不朽的哲学家的谬论。

  221  Atheists ought to say what is perfectly evident; now it is not perfectly evident that the soul is material. 
 221 无神论者应该说出完全明显的话；现在灵魂是物质的这一点还不是很明显。
  222  _Atheists._--What reason have they for saying that we cannot rise from the dead? What is more difficult, to be born or to rise again; that what has never been should be, or that what has been should be again? Is it more difficult to come into existence than to return to it? Habit makes the one appear easy to us; want of habit makes the other impossible. 
 222_无神论者_--他们有什么理由说我们不能从死里复活？出生和复活哪个更困难？从未发生过的事情应该如此，或者已经发生过的事情应该再次发生？存在比回到存在更困难吗？习惯使我们看起来很容易；缺乏习惯，其他的就不可能了。
A popular way of thinking!  Why cannot a virgin bear a child? Does a hen not lay eggs without a cock? What distinguishes these outwardly from others? And who has told us that the hen may not form the germ as well as the cock?   223  What have they to say against the resurrection, and against the child-bearing of the Virgin? Which is the more difficult, to produce a man or an animal, or to reproduce it? And if they had never seen any species of animals, could they have conjectured whether they were produced without connection with each other?   224  How I hate these follies of not believing in the Eucharist, etc.! If the Gospel be true, if Jesus Christ be God, what difficulty is there?   225  Atheism shows strength of mind, but only to a certain degree. 
一种流行的思维方式！为什么处女不能生育？没有公鸡母鸡就不会下蛋吗？这些产品与其他产品在外观上有什么区别？谁告诉我们母鸡不能像公鸡那样形成胚芽？ 223 他们对复活和童贞女生育有什么看法？生出一个人、生出一只动物，还是繁衍一个动物，哪一个更困难？如果他们从未见过任何种类的动物，他们是否能推测它们的产生是否彼此之间没有联系？第224章 我多么痛恨这些不信圣体圣事的愚蠢行为啊！如果福音是真的，如果耶稣基督是神，那还有什么困难呢？ 225 无神论显示了心灵的力量，但只是在一定程度上。
  226  Infidels, who profess to follow reason, ought to be exceedingly strong in reason. 
 226 自称遵循理性的异教徒，应该具有极其强大的理性。
"What say they then? ""Do we not see,"" say they, ""that the brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks, like us,"" etc. "
那他们怎么说呢？他们说：“难道我们没有看到，野兽像人一样生活和死亡，而土耳其人像基督徒一样吗？他们有他们的仪式，他们的先知，他们的医生，他们的圣人，他们的僧侣，就像我们一样。”等等。
(Is this contrary to Scripture? Does it not say all this?)  If you care but little to know the truth, here is enough of it to leave you in repose. 
 （这与圣经相悖吗？圣经不是这么说的吗？）如果你不太关心真相，这里的内容足以让你安心。
But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail. 
但如果你全心全意地渴望知道它，那是不够的；详细看看。
This would be sufficient for a question in philosophy; but not here, where it concerns your all. 
这对于哲学问题来说就足够了；但不是在这里，这里关系到你的一切。
And yet, after a trifling reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves, etc. 
然而，经过这种琐碎的思考后，我们就会去娱乐自己，等等。
Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us. 
让我们询问同一宗教，它是否没有给出这种默默无闻的原因？也许它会教给我们。
  227  _Order by dialogues._--What ought I to do? I see only darkness everywhere. 
 227_按对话顺序_--我该怎么办？我只看到到处都是黑暗。
"Shall I believe I am nothing? Shall I believe I am God?  ""All things change and succeed each other."" You are mistaken; there is ... "
我该相信我什么都不是吗？我该相信我是神吗？ “万物皆变，相辅相成。”你误会了;有 ...
"  228  Objection of atheists: ""But we have no light.""   229  This is what I see and what troubles me. "
 228 无神论者的反对意见：“但我们没有光。” 229 这就是我所看到的，也是令我困扰的。
I look on all sides, and I see only darkness everywhere. 
我环顾四周，只看到到处都是黑暗。
Nature presents to me nothing which is not matter of doubt and concern. 
大自然向我呈现的一切都是值得怀疑和担忧的。
If I saw nothing there which revealed a Divinity, I would come to a negative conclusion; if I saw everywhere the signs of a Creator, I would remain peacefully in faith. 
如果我在那里没有看到任何揭示神性的东西，我就会得出否定的结论；如果我到处都能看到造物主的迹象，我就会平静地保持信仰。
But, seeing too much to deny and too little to be sure, I am in a state to be pitied; wherefore I have a hundred time wished that if a God maintains nature, she should testify to Him unequivocally, and that, if the signs she gives are deceptive, she should suppress them altogether; that she should say everything or nothing, that I might see which cause I ought to follow. 
但是，我看到的东西太多，无法否认，又太少，无法确定，我的处境很可怜。因此，我一百次地希望，如果上帝维护自然，她应该明确地为他作证；如果她给出的迹象是欺骗性的，她应该完全压制它们；她要么什么都说，要么什么也不说，这样我就能明白我应该遵循哪一个原因。
Whereas in my present state, ignorant of what I am or of what I ought to do, I know neither my condition nor my duty. 
而在我现在的状态下，我不知道我是什么，也不知道我应该做什么，我既不知道我的状况，也不知道我的责任。
My heart inclines wholly to know where is the true good, in order to follow it; nothing would be too dear to me for eternity. 
我的心完全倾向于知道真正的善在哪里，以便追随它；对我来说，没有什么是永恒的。
 I envy those whom I see living in the faith with such carelessness, and who make such a bad use of a gift of which it seems to me I would make such a different use. 
我羡慕那些我所看到的如此粗心地生活在信仰中的人，以及他们如此糟糕地利用了一份恩赐，而在我看来，我会以如此不同的方式使用这份恩赐。
  230  It is incomprehensible that God should exist, and it is incomprehensible that He should not exist; that the soul should be joined to the body, and that we should have no soul; that the world should be created, and that it should not be created, etc.; that original sin should be, and that it should not be. 
 230 神存在是不可理解的，神不存在也是不可理解的；灵魂应该与身体结合，而我们不应该有灵魂；世界应该被创造，世界不应该被创造，等等；原罪应该是，不应该是。
  231  Do you believe it to be impossible that God is infinite, without parts?--Yes. 
 231 你认为上帝是无限的、没有部分的这不可能吗？——是的。
I wish therefore to show you an infinite and indivisible thing. 
因此，我希望向您展示一个无限且不可分割的事物。
It is a point moving everywhere with an infinite velocity; for it is one in all places, and is all totality in every place. 
它是一个以无限速度到处移动的点；因为它在所有地方都是一，并且在每个地方都是整体。
 Let this effect of nature, which previously seemed to you impossible, make you know that there may be others of which you are still ignorant. 
让这种以前在你看来不可能的自然效应让你知道，可能还有其他你仍然不知道的事情。
Do not draw this conclusion from your experiment, that there remains nothing for you to know; but rather that there remains an infinity for you to know. 
不要从你的实验中得出这样的结论：你没有什么可以知道的；而是还有无限的东西等待着你去了解。
  232  Infinite movement, the point which fills everything, the moment of rest; infinite without quantity, indivisible and infinite. 
 232 无限的运动，充满一切的点，静止的时刻；无限而无数量，不可分割且无限。
  233  _Infinite_--_nothing._--Our soul is cast into a body, where it finds number, time, dimension. 
 233 _Infinite_--_nothing._--我们的灵魂被铸入身体，在那里它找到了数量、时间和维度。
Thereupon it reasons, and calls this nature, necessity, and can believe nothing else. 
于是它推理，并称这种性质为必然性，并且不能相信其他任何东西。
 Unity joined to infinity adds nothing to it, no more than one foot to an infinite measure. 
统一与无限相结合，不会增加任何东西，就像无限量度中的一英尺一样。
The finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. 
有限在无限面前湮灭，变成纯粹的虚无。
So our spirit before God, so our justice before divine justice. 
因此，我们的精神在上帝面前，我们的正义在神圣的正义面前。
There is not so great a disproportion between our justice and that of God, as between unity and infinity. 
我们的正义与上帝的正义之间并不存在如此巨大的不相称，正如统一与无限之间不相称一样。
 The justice of God must be vast like His compassion. 
上帝的公义必须像他的怜悯一样广大。
Now justice to the outcast is less vast, and ought less to offend our feelings than mercy towards the elect. 
现在，对被遗弃者的正义不再那么广泛，也不应该像对选民的怜悯那样冒犯我们的感情。
 We know that there is an infinite, and are ignorant of its nature. 
我们知道存在无限，但不知道它的本质。
As we know it to be false that numbers are finite, it is therefore true that there is an infinity in number. 
我们知道，数字是有限的这一说法是错误的，因此，数字是无限的这一说法是正确的。
But we do not know what it is. 
但我们不知道它是什么。
It is false that it is even, it is false that it is odd; for the addition of a unit can make no change in its nature. 
偶数为假，奇数为假；因为单位的增加并不能改变其性质。
Yet it is a number, and every number is odd or even (this is certainly true of every finite number). 
然而它是一个数字，并且每个数字都是奇数或偶数（对于每个有限数来说当然都是如此）。
So we may well know that there is a God without knowing what He is. 
因此，我们很可能知道有一位神，但不知道他是什么。
Is there not one substantial truth, seeing there are so many things which are not the truth itself?  We know then the existence and nature of the finite, because we also are finite and have extension. 
既然有这么多事情不是真理本身，难道就没有一个实质性的真理吗？那么我们就知道有限的存在和本质，因为我们也是有限的并且具有广延性。
We know the existence of the infinite, and are ignorant of its nature, because it has extension like us, but not limits like us. 
我们知道无限的存在，但不知道它的本质，因为它像我们一样具有广延，但不像我们一样有限制。
But we know neither the existence nor the nature of God, because He has neither extension nor limits. 
但我们既不知道上帝的存在，也不知道上帝的本质，因为他既没有广度，也没有限制。
 But by faith we know His existence; in glory we shall know His nature. 
但凭着信心我们知道他的存在；在荣耀中我们将认识他的本性。
Now, I have already shown that we may well know the existence of a thing, without knowing its nature. 
现在，我已经表明，我们很可能知道一个事物的存在，但不知道它的本质。
 Let us now speak according to natural lights. 
现在让我们按照自然光说话。
 If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. 
如果有一位上帝，他是无限不可理解的，因为他既没有部分，也没有限制，与我们没有亲和力。
We are then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is. 
那么我们就无法知道他是什么或者他是否存在。
This being so, who will dare to undertake the decision of the question? Not we, who have no affinity to Him. 
既然如此，谁敢来承担问题的决定呢？不是我们，因为我们与他没有亲缘关系。
 Who then will blame Christians for not being able to give a reason for their belief, since they profess a religion for which they cannot give a reason? They declare, in expounding it to the world, that it is a foolishness, _stultitiam_;[90] and then you complain that they do not prove it! If they proved it, they would not keep their word; it is in lacking proofs, that they are not lacking in sense. 
那么谁会责怪基督徒无法为他们的信仰给出一个理由，因为他们自称是一个他们无法给出理由的宗教呢？他们在向世界解释这一点时宣称这是愚蠢的，_stultitiam_；[90]然后你抱怨他们没有证明这一点！如果他们证明了这一点，他们就不会遵守诺言；正是缺乏证据，他们才不缺乏道理。
"Yes, but although this excuses those who offer it as such, and takes away from them the blame of putting it forward without reason, it does not excuse those who receive it. Let us then examine this point, and say, ""God is, or He is not."" But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide nothing here. "
是的，但是，尽管这为那些提供此类信息的人提供了借口，并免除了他们无故提出该信息的责备，但这并不能原谅那些接受它的人。让我们考察这一点，并说：“神存在，或者神不存在”。但我们该偏向哪一边呢？理性在这里不能决定任何事情。
There is an infinite chaos which separated us. 
有一种无限的混乱将我们分开。
A game is being played at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails will turn up. 
一场游戏正在这个无限距离的尽头进行，正面或反面都会出现。
What will you wager? According to reason, you can do neither the one thing nor the other; according to reason, you can defend neither of the propositions. 
你会打赌什么？根据理性，你既不能做一件事，也不能做另一件事；根据理性，你无法为这两个命题辩护。
 Do not then reprove for error those who have made a choice; for you know nothing about it. 
不要责备那些做出选择的人的错误；因为你对此一无所知。
"No, but I blame them for having made, not this choice, but a choice; for again both he who chooses heads and he who chooses tails are equally at fault, they are both in the wrong. _x000D_
The true course is not to wager at all.  Yes; but you must wager. "
不，但我责怪他们做出的不是这个选择，而是一个选择；因为选择正面的人和选择反面的人同样都有过错，他们都有错。 _x000D_ 真正的做法是根本不下注。是的;但你必须下注。
It is not optional. 
它不是可选的。
You are embarked. 
你已经上船了。
Which will you choose then? Let us see. 
那你会选择哪一个呢？让我们来看看。
Since you must choose, let us see which interests you least. 
既然您必须选择，那么让我们看看您最不感兴趣的是什么。
You have two things to lose, the true and the good; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun, error and misery. 
你有两件事会失去，真实的和美好的；有两件事值得赌注：你的理性和你的意志，你的知识和你的幸福；你的本性有两件事要避免：错误和痛苦。
Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than the other, since you must of necessity choose. 
选择其中一个而不是另一个时，你的理智并不感到震惊，因为你必须做出选择。
This is one point settled. 
这一点已经解决了。
But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. 
但你的幸福呢？让我们衡量一下押注上帝存在的得失。
Let us estimate these two chances. 
让我们估计一下这两个机会。
If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. 
如果你得到了，你就得到了一切；如果你得到了，你就得到了一切；如果你输了，你什么也不会失去。
"Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.--""That is very fine. "
那么，毫不犹豫地打赌，他就是——“那很好。
"Yes, I must wager; but I may perhaps wager too much.""--Let us see. "
是的，我必须打赌；但我也许下注太多了。”——让我们看看。
Since there is an equal risk of gain and of loss, if you had only to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager. 
由于得失风险相同，如果你只需要赢得两条生命，而不是一条生命，你仍然可以下注。
But if there were three lives to gain, you would have to play (since you are under the necessity of playing), and you would be imprudent, when you are forced to play, not to chance your life to gain three at a game where there is an equal risk of loss and gain. 
但如果要获得三条生命，你就必须玩（因为你有必要玩），而当你被迫玩时，你不会冒险在一场游戏中获得三条生命，这就是轻率的。损失和收益的风险是相等的。
But there is an eternity of life and happiness. 
但生命和幸福是永恒的。
And this being so, if there were an infinity of chances, of which one only would be for you, you would still be right in wagering one to win two, and you would act stupidly, being obliged to play, by refusing to stake one life against three at a game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one for you, if there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain. 
既然如此，如果有无限的机会，其中只有一个适合你，你仍然可以赌一赢二，而你会表现得很愚蠢，被迫参加，拒绝赌一个人生在一场游戏中对抗三人，如果你能获得无限的幸福生活，那么在无限的机会中，总有一个适合你。
But there is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite. 
但这里有无限的幸福生活可供获得，有一个获得的机会与有限数量的损失的机会相对应，而你所赌注的东西是有限的。
It is all divided; wherever the infinite is and there is not an infinity of chances of loss against that of gain, there is no time to hesitate, you must give all. 
一切都是分裂的；哪里有无限，哪里就有无限的得失机会，没有时间犹豫，你必须全力以赴。
And thus, when one is forced to play, he must renounce reason to preserve his life, rather than risk it for infinite gain, as likely to happen as the loss of nothingness. 
因此，当一个人被迫参加比赛时，他必须放弃理性来保全自己的生命，而不是为了无限的利益而冒险，因为这种情况很可能会发生，就像失去虚无一样。
 For it is no use to say it is uncertain if we will gain, and it is certain that we risk, and that the infinite distance between the _certainty_ of what is staked and the _uncertainty_ of what will be gained, equals the finite good which is certainly staked against the uncertain infinite. 
因为说我们是否会获益是不确定的，而且我们肯定会冒险，而且赌注的_确定性_和将获得的_不确定性_之间的无限距离等于有限的善，这是没有用的。当然是针对不确定的无限。
It is not so, as every player stakes a certainty to gain an uncertainty, and yet he stakes a finite certainty to gain a finite uncertainty, without transgressing against reason. 
事实并非如此，因为每个参与者都押注确定性来获得不确定性，但他又押注有限的确定性来获得有限的不确定性，而不会违反理性。
There is not an infinite distance between the certainty staked and the uncertainty of the gain; that is untrue. 
赌注的确定性和收益的不确定性之间并不存在无限的距离；这是不真实的。
In truth, there is an infinity between the certainty of gain and the certainty of loss. 
事实上，收益的确定性和损失的确定性之间存在无穷大。
But the uncertainty of the gain is proportioned to the certainty of the stake according to the proportion of the chances of gain and loss. 
但收益的不确定性是根据收益和损失的机会比例与股权的确定性成比例的。
Hence it comes that, if there are as many risks on one side as on the other, the course is to play even; and then the certainty of the stake is equal to the uncertainty of the gain, so far is it from fact that there is an infinite distance between them. 
因此，如果一方的风险与另一方的风险一样多，则应该采取平局；那么，赌注的确定性就等于收益的不确定性，事实上，它们之间存在着无限的距离。
And so our proposition is of infinite force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain. 
因此，当游戏中的赌注是有限的，而收益和损失的风险是相等的，并且收益是无限的时，我们的命题就具有无限的力量。
This is demonstrable; and if men are capable of any truths, this is one. 
这是可以证明的；如果说人能够获得任何真理的话，这就是其中之一。
" ""I confess it, I admit it. "
 “我承认，我承认。
"But, still, is there no means of seeing the faces of the cards?""--Yes, Scripture and the rest, etc. "
但是，仍然没有办法看到牌面吗？”——是的，圣经和其他的，等等。
"Yes, but I have my hands tied and my mouth closed; I am forced to wager, and am not free. _x000D_
I am not released, and am so made that I cannot believe. _x000D_
What, then, would you have me do?  True. "
是的，但我双手被绑，嘴巴被堵住；我被迫打赌，而且并不自由。 _x000D_ 我没有被释放，并且被造得令人难以置信。 _x000D_ 那么，你想让我做什么？真的。
But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe. 
但至少要知道你无法相信，因为理性把你带到了这个地步，但你却无法相信。
Endeavour then to convince yourself, not by increase of proofs of God, but by the abatement of your passions. 
然后努力说服自己，不是通过增加上帝的证据，而是通过减少你的激情。
You would like to attain faith, and do not know the way; you would like to cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it. 
你想得信，却不知路；你想治愈自己的不信，并寻求补救办法。
Learn of those who have been bound like you, and who now stake all their possessions. 
了解那些像你一样被束缚、现在赌上自己所有财产的人。
These are people who know the way which you would follow, and who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured. 
这些人知道你将要走的道路，并且治愈了你所要治愈的疾病。
Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. 
沿着他们开始的路走；通过表现得好像他们相信、接受圣水、做弥撒等等。
"Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.--""But this is what I am afraid of.""--And why? What have you to lose?  But to show you that this leads you there, it is this which will lessen the passions, which are your stumbling-blocks. "
即使这样也会自然地让你相信，并减弱你的敏锐性。--“但这就是我所害怕的。”--为什么？你有什么可失去的？但为了向你表明这会引导你到达那里，正是这会减少激情，而激情是你的绊脚石。
 _The end of this discourse._--Now, what harm will befall you in taking this side? You will be faithful, honest, humble, grateful, generous, a sincere friend, truthful. 
_本次演讲结束。_--那么，你站在这一边会给你带来什么伤害呢？你将是忠诚、诚实、谦虚、感恩、慷慨、真诚的朋友、诚实的人。
Certainly you will not have those poisonous pleasures, glory and luxury; but will you not have others? I will tell you that you will thereby gain in this life, and that, at each step you take on this road, you will see so great certainty of gain, so much nothingness in what you risk, that you will at last recognise that you have wagered for something certain and infinite, for which you have given nothing. 
当然你不会有那些有毒的快乐、荣耀和奢侈；但你就不会有其他人吗？我会告诉你，你将因此而在这一生中有所收获，并且，在这条道路上你迈出的每一步，你都会看到收益的确定性如此之大，所冒的风险如此之微不足道，以至于你最终会认识到，为某种确定的、无限的东西下注，但你却没有付出任何代价。
" ""Ah! This discourse transports me, charms me,"" etc. "
 “啊！这个话语让我感动，让我着迷，”等等。
 If this discourse pleases you and seems impressive, know that it is made by a man who has knelt, both before and after it, in prayer to that Being, infinite and without parts, before whom he lays all he has, for you also to lay before Him all you have for your own good and for His glory, that so strength may be given to lowliness. 
如果这个演讲令你高兴并且看起来令人印象深刻，请知道它是由一个在演讲之前和之后跪下的人所做的，他向无限且无部分的存在祈祷，他在他面前展示了他的一切，以便你也能为了你自己的利益和他的荣耀，把你所有的一切都放在他面前，这样卑微的人就可以得到力量。
  234  If we must not act save on a certainty, we ought not to act on religion, for it is not certain. 
234 如果我们必须根据确定性行事，那么我们就不应该根据宗教行事，因为它是不确定的。
But how many things we do on an uncertainty, sea voyages, battles! I say then we must do nothing at all, for nothing is certain, and that there is more certainty in religion than there is as to whether we may see to-morrow; for it is not certain that we may see to-morrow, and it is certainly possible that we may not see it. 
但是我们在不确定的情况下做了多少事情，比如海上航行、战斗！我说，那么我们就什么都不要做，因为没有什么是确定的，而且宗教中的确定性比我们是否能看到明天更确定。因为我们不确定明天是否能看到，而且很可能我们看不到明天。
We cannot say as much about religion. 
关于宗教，我们不能说太多。
It is not certain that it is; but who will venture to say that it is certainly possible that it is not? Now when we work for to-morrow, and so on an uncertainty, we act reasonably; for we ought to work for an uncertainty according to the doctrine of chance which was demonstrated above. 
不确定是不是这样；但谁敢说这肯定有可能不是呢？现在，当我们为明天等不确定性而工作时，我们会采取合理的行动；因为我们应该根据上面所论证的机会学说来努力解决不确定性。
 Saint Augustine has seen that we work for an uncertainty, on sea, in battle, etc. 
圣奥古斯丁已经看到我们在海上、战斗等方面为不确定性而工作。
But he has not seen the doctrine of chance which proves that we should do so. 
但他还没有看到机会学说证明我们应该这样做。
Montaigne has seen that we are shocked at a fool, and that habit is all-powerful; but he has not seen the reason of this effect. 
蒙田发现我们对傻瓜感到震惊，而这种习惯是万能的。但他还没有看到造成这种效果的原因。
 All these persons have seen the effects, but they have not seen the causes. 
这些人都看到了果，却没有看到因。
They are, in comparison with those who have discovered the causes, as those who have only eyes are in comparison with those who have intellect. 
他们与那些发现原因的人相比，就像那些只有眼睛的人与那些有智力的人相比一样。
For the effects are perceptible by sense, and the causes are visible only to the intellect. 
因为结果可以通过感官感知，而原因只能通过智力才能看到。
And although these effects are seen by the mind, this mind is, in comparison with the mind which sees the causes, as the bodily senses are in comparison with the intellect. 
尽管这些结果是由心智看到的，但与看到原因的心智相比，这个心智就如同身体感官与智力的比较一样。
"  235  _Rem viderunt, causam non viderunt._   236  According to the doctrine of chance, you ought to put yourself to the trouble of searching for the truth; for if you die without worshipping the True Cause, you are lost.--""But,"" say you, ""if He had wished me to worship Him, He would have left me signs of His will.""--He has done so; but you neglect them. "
第235章 _236、第236章因为如果你死时没有崇拜真正的事业，你就迷失了。——“但是，”你说，“如果他希望我崇拜他，他就会给我留下他意志的迹象。”——他已经这样做了;但你忽视了他们。
Seek them, therefore; it is well worth it. 
因此，寻找他们；这是非常值得的。
  237  _Chances._--We must live differently in the world, according to these different assumptions: (1) that we could always remain in it; (2) that it is certain that we shall not remain here long, and uncertain if we shall remain here one hour. 
 237 _机会._--根据这些不同的假设，我们必须以不同的方式生活在这个世界上：（1）我们可以永远留在其中； (2) 确定我们不会在这里停留太久，但不确定我们是否会在这里停留一小时。
This last assumption is our condition. 
最后一个假设就是我们的条件。
  238  What do you then promise me, in addition to certain troubles, but ten years of self-love (for ten years is the chance), to try hard to please without success?   239  _Objection._--Those who hope for salvation are so far happy; but they have as a counterpoise the fear of hell. 
 238 那你答应我什么，除了一定的烦恼，而是十年的自爱（十年是机会），努力讨好却没有成功？ 239_反对。_--那些希望得救的人到目前为止是幸福的；但他们有对地狱的恐惧作为平衡。
" _Reply._--Who has most reason to fear hell: he who is in ignorance whether there is a hell, and who is certain of damnation if there is; or he who certainly believes there is a hell, and hopes to be saved if there is?   240  ""I would soon have renounced pleasure,"" say they, ""had I faith."" For my part I tell you, ""You would soon have faith, if you renounced pleasure."" Now, it is for you to begin. "
_答复--谁最有理由害怕地狱：谁不知道是否有地狱，如果有，就肯定会受到诅咒；或者他肯定相信有地狱，并且希望如果有地狱就可以得救？ 240 他们说：“如果我有信心，我很快就会放弃快乐。”就我而言，我告诉你：“如果你放弃享乐，你很快就会有信仰。”现在，你可以开始了。
If I could, I would give you faith. 
如果可以的话，我会给你信心。
I cannot do so, nor therefore test the truth of what you say. 
我不能这样做，也不能验证你所说的真实性。
But you can well renounce pleasure, and test whether what I say is true. 
但你完全可以放弃享乐，并检验我所说的是否正确。
  241  _Order._--I would have far more fear of being mistaken, and of finding that the Christian religion was true, than of not being mistaken in believing it true. 
 241_秩序._--我更害怕被错误地发现基督教信仰是真实的，而不是相信它是真实的而不被错误地相信。
    SECTION IV  OF THE MEANS OF BELIEF   242  _Preface to the second part._--To speak of those who have treated of this matter. 
第四节信仰之道 242_第二部分序言。_--谈谈那些处理过这个问题的人。
 I admire the boldness with which these persons undertake to speak of God. 
我钦佩这些人谈论上帝的勇气。
In addressing their argument to infidels, their first chapter is to prove Divinity from the works of nature.[91] I should not be astonished at their enterprise, if they were addressing their argument to the faithful; for it is certain that those who have the living faith in their heart see at once that all existence is none other than the work of the God whom they adore. 
在向异教徒提出他们的论点时，他们的第一章是从自然的作品中证明神性。 [91]如果他们是向信徒提出他们的论点，我不会对他们的事业感到惊讶；因为可以肯定的是，那些心中有活泼信仰的人会立刻看出一切存在都是他们所崇拜的上帝的作品。
But for those in whom this light is extinguished, and in whom we purpose to rekindle it, persons destitute of faith and grace, who, seeking with all their light whatever they see in nature that can bring them to this knowledge, find only obscurity and darkness; to tell them that they have only to look at the smallest things which surround them, and they will see God openly, to give them, as a complete proof of this great and important matter, the course of the moon and planets, and to claim to have concluded the proof with such an argument, is to give them ground for believing that the proofs of our religion are very weak. 
但对于那些内心的光明已经熄灭的人，以及我们打算在他们身上重新点燃它的人来说，那些缺乏信仰和恩典的人，他们用他们所有的光明来寻找他们在自然界中看到的任何东西，可以使他们获得这种知识，却只发现了晦涩难懂的东西。黑暗;告诉他们，只要看看他们周围最小的事物，他们就会公开地看到上帝，向他们提供月球和行星的运行轨迹，作为这一伟大而重要的事情的完整证据，并声称用这样的论证来得出证据，就是让他们有理由相信我们宗教的证据非常薄弱。
And I see by reason and experience that nothing is more calculated to arouse their contempt. 
根据理性和经验，我发现没有什么比这更能激起他们的蔑视了。
 It is not after this manner that Scripture speaks, which has a better knowledge of the things that are of God. 
圣经并不是以这种方式说话，它对属于上帝的事情有更好的认识。
It says, on the contrary, that God is a hidden God, and that, since the corruption of nature, He has left men in a darkness from which they can escape only through Jesus Christ, without whom all communion with God is cut off. 
相反，它说上帝是隐藏的上帝，自从自然的腐败以来，他把人类留在了黑暗中，他们只能通过耶稣基督才能逃脱，没有他，与上帝的所有交流都被切断了。
"_Nemo novit Patrem, nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare._[92]  This is what Scripture points out to us, when it says in so many places that those who seek God find Him.[93] It is not of that light, ""like the noonday sun,"" that this is said. "
 _Nemo novit Patrem, nisi Filius, et cui voluerit Filius revelare._[92] 这就是圣经向我们指出的，它在很多地方都说寻求上帝的人会找到他。[93]这并不是所说的“像正午的太阳”那样的光。
We do not say that those who seek the noonday sun, or water in the sea, shall find them; and hence the evidence of God must not be of this nature. 
我们并不是说那些寻求正午的阳光或大海中的水的人就会找到它们；但是，因此，上帝的证据绝不能具有这种性质。
So it tells us elsewhere: _Vere tu es Deus absconditus_.[94]   243  It is an astounding fact that no canonical writer has ever made use of nature to prove God. 
所以它在其他地方告诉我们：_Vere tu es Deus Abconditus_。[94] 243 令人震惊的事实是，没有任何正典作者利用自然来证明上帝。
They all strive to make us believe in Him. 
他们都努力让我们相信他。
"David, Solomon, etc., have never said, ""There is no void, therefore there is a God."" They must have had more knowledge than the most learned people who came after them, and who have all made use of this argument. "
大卫、所罗门等人从来没有说过“没有空，所以有神”。他们一定比他们之后最有学问的人拥有更多的知识，而且他们都利用了这个论点。
This is worthy of attention. 
这是值得关注的。
"  244  ""Why! Do you not say yourself that the heavens and birds prove God?"" No. "
第244话不。
And does your religion not say so? No. 
你的宗教信仰不是这么说的吗？不。
For although it is true in a sense for some souls to whom God gives this light, yet it is false with respect to the majority of men. 
因为，尽管对于上帝赐予这亮光的某些灵魂来说，这在某种意义上是正确的，但对于大多数人来说，这却是错误的。
  245  There are three sources of belief: reason, custom, inspiration. 
 245 信仰有三种来源：理性、习俗、灵感。
The Christian religion, which alone has reason, does not acknowledge as her true children those who believe without inspiration. 
唯有基督教具有理性，它并不承认那些没有灵感而相信的人是她真正的孩子。
It is not that she excludes reason and custom. 
这并不是说她排除理性和习俗。
On the contrary, the mind must be opened to proofs, must be confirmed by custom, and offer itself in humbleness to inspirations, which alone can produce a true and saving effect. 
相反，心灵必须接受证据，必须得到习惯的证实，并谦虚地接受灵感，只有这样才能产生真正的、拯救性的效果。
"_Ne evacuetur crux Christi._[95]   246  _Order._--After the letter _That we ought to seek God_, to write the letter _On removing obstacles_; which is the discourse on ""the machine,""[96] on preparing the machine, on seeking by reason. "
 _Ne evacuetur crux Christi._[95] 246 _Order._--在“我们应该寻求上帝”这封信之后，写下“关于消除障碍”的信；这是关于“机器”的话语，[96]关于准备机器、关于理性寻求的话语。
  247  _Order._--A letter of exhortation to a friend to induce him to seek. 
 247 _Order._--给朋友的一封劝诫信，诱使他寻求。
"And he will reply, ""But what is the use of seeking? Nothing is seen."" Then to reply to him, ""Do not despair."" And he will answer that he would be glad to find some light, but that, according to this very religion, if he believed in it, it will be of no use to him, and that therefore he prefers not to seek. "
他会回答说：“但是寻找有什么用呢？什么也看不见。”然后回答他：“不要绝望。”他会回答说，他很高兴找到一些亮光，但是，根据这个宗教，如果他相信它，那对他来说就没用，因此他宁愿不去寻求。
And to answer to that: The machine. 
回答这个问题：机器。
  248  _A letter which indicates the use of proofs by the machine._--Faith is different from proof; the one is human, the other is a gift of God. 
248_A letter that indicates the use ofproofs by the machine._--信仰与证明不同；一个是人类，另一个是上帝的恩赐。
_Justus ex fide vivit._[97] It is this faith that God Himself puts into the heart, of which the proof is often the instrument, _fides ex auditu_;[98] but this faith is in the heart, and makes us not say _scio_, but _credo_. 
 _Justus ex fide vivit._[97] 正是上帝亲自将这种信仰放入心中，其证据往往是工具，_fides ex Auditu_；[98] 但这种信仰是在心中，使我们不说_scio_，但是_credo_。
  249  It is superstition to put one's hope in formalities; but it is pride to be unwilling to submit to them. 
 249、寄希望于形式，是迷信；寄希望于形式，是迷信。但不愿意屈服于他们却是一种骄傲。
  250  The external must be joined to the internal to obtain anything from God, that is to say, we must kneel, pray with the lips, etc., in order that proud man, who would not submit himself to God, may be now subject to the creature.[99] To expect help from these externals is superstition; to refuse to join them to the internal is pride. 
 250 要想从神得到什么，就必须外在与内在结合，也就是说必须跪下、用嘴唇祷告等等，才能让那个不肯顺服神的骄傲的人现在臣服到该生物。[99]期望从这些外部力量得到帮助是迷信。拒绝加入他们的内部是一种骄傲。
  251  Other religions, as the pagan, are more popular, for they consist in externals. 
 251 其他宗教，如异教，更受欢迎，因为它们存在于外在之中。
But they are not for educated people. 
但它们不适合受过教育的人。
A purely intellectual religion would be more suited to the learned, but it would be of no use to the common people. 
纯粹知识性的宗教更适合有学问的人，但对普通人来说毫无用处。
The Christian religion alone is adapted to all, being composed of externals and internals. 
只有基督教适合所有人，由外在和内在组成。
It raises the common people to the internal, and humbles the proud to the external; it is not perfect without the two, for the people must understand the spirit of the letter, and the learned must submit their spirit to the letter. 
内举百姓，外贬卑人；两者缺一不可，民须明其义，有学问者须遵其义。
  252  For we must not misunderstand ourselves; we are as much automatic as intellectual; and hence it comes that the instrument by which conviction is attained is not demonstrated alone. 
 252、我们不要误解自己；我们既是自动的又是理智的；因此，获得信念的工具并不是单独被证明的。
How few things are demonstrated? Proofs only convince the mind. 
所展示的东西有多少？证据只能说服头脑。
Custom is the source of our strongest and most believed proofs. 
定制是我们最有力、最值得信赖的证据的来源。
It bends the automaton, which persuades the mind without its thinking about the matter. 
它使自动机弯曲，无需思考问题即可说服大脑。
Who has demonstrated that there will be a to-morrow, and that we shall die? And what is more believed? It is, then, custom which persuades us of it; it is custom that makes so many men Christians; custom that makes them Turks, heathens, artisans, soldiers, etc. 
谁证明了会有明天，而且我们会死？更相信什么？那么，正是习惯使我们相信了这一点。正是习俗使许多人成为基督徒。使他们成为土耳其人、异教徒、工匠、士兵等的习俗。
(Faith in baptism is more received among Christians than among Turks.) Finally, we must have recourse to it when once the mind has seen where the truth is, in order to quench our thirst, and steep ourselves in that belief, which escapes us at every hour; for always to have proofs ready is too much trouble. 
 （对洗礼的信仰在基督徒中比在土耳其人中更受欢迎。）最后，当我们的头脑看到真理在哪里时，我们必须诉诸洗礼，以解我们的干渴，并使自己沉浸在我们所忽视的信仰中。每小时；因为总是准备好证据太麻烦了。
We must get an easier belief, which is that of custom, which, without violence, without art, without argument, makes us believe things, and inclines all our powers to this belief, so that out soul falls naturally into it. 
我们必须获得一种更容易的信仰，即习惯的信仰，它无需暴力，无需艺术，无需争论，使我们相信事物，并将我们所有的力量倾注于这种信仰，以便我们的灵魂自然地陷入其中。
It is not enough to believe only by force of conviction, when the automaton is inclined to believe the contrary. 
当自动机倾向于相信相反的情况时，仅仅依靠信念的力量去相信是不够的。
Both our parts must be made to believe, the mind by reasons which it is sufficient to have seen once in a lifetime, and the automaton by custom, and by not allowing it to incline to the contrary. 
我们双方都必须相信，头脑的理由是一生中见过一次就足够了，而自动机的则是习惯，不允许它有相反的倾向。
_Inclina cor meum, Deus._[100]  The reason acts slowly, with so many examinations, and on so many principles, which must be always present, that at every hour it falls asleep, or wanders, through want of having all its principles present. 
 _Inclina cor meum, Deus._[100] 理性行动缓慢，经过如此多的检查，并基于如此多的原则，这些原则必须始终存在，以至于每个小时它都会因为缺乏所有原则而睡着或徘徊展示。
Feeling does not act thus; it acts in a moment, and is always ready to act. 
受不是这样行动的；它立即行动，并且随时准备行动。
We must then put our faith in feeling; otherwise it will be always vacillating. 
我们必须相信感觉；否则就会一直摇摆不定。
  253  Two extremes: to exclude reason, to admit reason only. 
 253 两个极端：排除理性，只承认理性。
  254  It is not a rare thing to have to reprove the world for too much docility. 
 254 责备世界过于温顺的情况并不罕见。
It is a natural vice like credulity, and as pernicious. 
这是一种自然的恶习，就像轻信一样，而且同样有害。
Superstition. 
迷信。
  255  Piety is different from superstition. 
 255 虔诚不同于迷信。
 To carry piety as far as superstition is to destroy it. 
将虔诚奉为迷信，就是将其摧毁。
 The heretics reproach us for this superstitious submission. 
异教徒指责我们这种迷信的服从。
This is to do what they reproach us for ... 
这是为了做他们责备我们的事情......
 Infidelity, not to believe in the Eucharist, because it is not seen. 
不忠，不相信圣体圣事，因为它是看不见的。
 Superstition to believe propositions. 
迷信相信命题。
Faith, etc. 
信仰等.
  256  I say there are few true Christians, even as regards faith. 
 256 我说真正的基督徒很少，即使在信仰方面也是如此。
There are many who believe but from superstition. 
有很多人相信，但都是出于迷信。
There are many who do not believe solely from wickedness. 
有许多人不相信仅仅是出于邪恶。
Few are between the two. 
介于两者之间的人很少。
 In this I do not include those who are of truly pious character, nor all those who believe from a feeling in their heart. 
我这里不包括真正虔诚的人，也不包括所有凭内心感觉相信的人。
  257  There are only three kinds of persons; those who serve God, having found Him; others who are occupied in seeking Him, not having found Him; while the remainder live without seeking Him, and without having found Him. 
 257 人只有三种：那些侍奉神的人，已经找到了他；还有一些人忙于寻找他，却没有找到他；而其余的人则活着，没有寻求他，也没有找到他。
The first are reasonable and happy, the last are foolish and unhappy; those between are unhappy and reasonable. 
前者是理性的、快乐的，后者是愚蠢的、不快乐的；介于两者之间的人是不高兴的和合理的。
  258  _Unusquisque sibi Deum fingit._[101]  Disgust. 
 258_Unusquisque sibi Deum fingit._[101] 厌恶。
  259  Ordinary people have the power of not thinking of that about which they do not wish to think. 
259 普通人有能力不去想他们不想想的事情。
Do not meditate on the passages about the Messiah, said the Jew to his son. 
 “不要沉思有关弥赛亚的章节，”犹太人对他的儿子说。
Thus our people often act. 
我们的人民经常这样做。
Thus are false religions preserved, and even the true one, in regard to many persons. 
因此，对于许多人来说，虚假的宗教甚至真实的宗教都得以保留。
 But there are some who have not the power of thus preventing thought, and who think so much the more as they are forbidden. 
但有些人却没有能力阻止思想，他们想得越多，就越被禁止。
These undo false religions, and even the true one, if they do not find solid arguments. 
如果他们找不到可靠的论据，这些就会消除错误的宗教，甚至消除真正的宗教。
  260  They hide themselves in the press, and call numbers to their rescue. 
 260 他们将自己隐藏在媒体中，并拨打救援电话。
Tumult. 
骚乱。
 _Authority._--So far from making it a rule to believe a thing because you have heard it, you ought to believe nothing without putting yourself into the position as if you had never heard it. 
 _权威._--远不是因为你听到过而相信某件事而成为一条规则，你应该不相信任何事情，除非把自己置于仿佛从未听说过的境地。
 It is your own assent to yourself, and the constant voice of your own reason, and not of others, that should make you believe. 
应该让你相信的是你自己对自己的同意，以及你自己理性的持续声音，而不是别人的声音。
 Belief is so important! A hundred contradictions might be true. 
信仰是如此重要！一百个矛盾可能都是真的。
If antiquity were the rule of belief, men of ancient time would then be without rule. 
如果古代是信仰的规则，那么古代的人就没有规则了。
If general consent, if men had perished?  False humanity, pride. 
如果普遍同意，如果人类都灭亡了呢？虚假的人性，骄傲。
 Lift the curtain. 
拉起窗帘。
You try in vain; if you must either believe, or deny, or doubt. 
你徒劳地尝试；如果你必须相信、否认或怀疑。
Shall we then have no rule? We judge that animals do well what they do. 
那么我们就没有规则了吗？我们认为动物做得很好。
Is there no rule whereby to judge men?  To deny, to believe, and to doubt well, are to a man what the race is to a horse. 
难道没有审判人的规则吗？否认、相信和怀疑对于一个人来说就像比赛对于一匹马一样。
 Punishment of those who sin, error. 
对犯罪、错误的人的惩罚。
  261  Those who do not love the truth take as a pretext that it is disputed, and that a multitude deny it. 
 261 那些不喜爱真理的人以真理有争议、许多人否认真理为借口。
And so their error arises only from this, that they do not love either truth or charity. 
因此，他们的错误仅源于此：他们既不热爱真理，也不热爱慈善。
Thus they are without excuse. 
因此他们没有任何借口。
  262  Superstition and lust. 
 262 迷信与情欲。
Scruples, evil desires. 
顾忌，邪恶的欲望。
Evil fear; fear, not such as comes from a belief in God, but such as comes from a doubt whether He exists or not. 
邪恶的恐惧；恐惧不是来自对上帝的信仰，而是来自对上帝是否存在的怀疑。
True fear comes from faith; false fear comes from doubt. 
真正的恐惧来自于信仰；虚假的恐惧来自怀疑。
True fear is joined to hope, because it is born of faith, and because men hope in the God in whom they believe. 
真正的恐惧是与希望结合在一起的，因为它源于信仰，也因为人们对他们所信仰的上帝抱有希望。
False fear is joined to despair, because men fear the God in whom they have no belief. 
虚假的恐惧与绝望交织在一起，因为人们敬畏他们所不信仰的上帝。
The former fear to lose Him; the latter fear to find Him. 
前者害怕失去他；后者害怕失去他。后者害怕找到他。
"  263  ""A miracle,"" says one, ""would strengthen my faith."" He says so when he does not see one. "
 263 一位人士说，“奇迹会增强我的信心。”当他没有看到任何人时，他会这么说。
Reasons, seen from afar, appear to limit our view; but when they are reached, we begin to see beyond. 
从远处看，原因似乎限制了我们的视野；但当达到这些目标时，我们开始看到更远的地方。
Nothing stops the nimbleness of our mind. 
没有什么能阻止我们思维的敏捷性。
There is no rule, say we, which has not some exceptions, no truth so general which has not some aspect in which it fails. 
我们说，没有一条规则是没有例外的，没有一条如此普遍的真理不存在某些方面的失败。
"It is sufficient that it be not absolutely universal to give us a pretext for applying the exceptions to the present subject, and for saying, ""This is not always true; there are therefore cases where it is not so."" It only remains to show that this is one of them; and that is why we are very awkward or unlucky, if we do not find one some day. "
它不是绝对普遍的，这足以为我们提供一个借口，将例外情况应用于当前主题，并说：“这并不总是正确的；因此，在某些情况下，情况并非如此。”剩下的只是表明这是其中之一；这就是为什么如果有一天我们找不到这样的人，我们会感到非常尴尬或不幸。
  264  We do not weary of eating and sleeping every day, for hunger and sleepiness recur. 
 264 日日食寝不倦，饥困常有。
Without that we should weary of them. 
如果没有这些，我们就会厌倦它们。
So, without the hunger for spiritual things, we weary of them. 
因此，如果没有对精神事物的渴望，我们就会厌倦它们。
Hunger after righteousness, the eighth beatitude.[102]   265  Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the contrary of what they see. 
饥渴求义，第八福。[102] 265 信仰确实讲述了感官所未告知的事情，但并不与他们所看到的相反。
It is above them and not contrary to them. 
它在他们之上，而不是与他们相反。
"  266  How many stars have telescopes revealed to us which did not exist for our philosophers of old! We freely attack Holy Scripture on the great number of stars, saying, ""There are only one thousand and twenty-eight,[103] we know it."" There is grass on the earth, we see it--from the moon we would not see it--and on the grass are leaves, and in these leaves are small animals; but after that no more.--O presumptuous man!--The compounds are composed of elements, and the elements not.--O presumptuous man! Here is a fine reflection.--We must not say that there is anything which we do not see.--We must then talk like others, but not think like them. "
266 望远镜向我们揭示了多少我们古代哲学家所不存在的恒星！我们自由地攻击圣经中关于众多星星的说法，说：“只有一千零二十八颗，[103]我们知道。”地球上有草，我们看到它——从月球上我们看不到它——草上有叶子，这些叶子里有小动物；但此后就不再这样了。--噢，自以为是的人！--化合物是由元素组成的，而元素却不是。--哦，自以为是的人！这是一个很好的反思。——我们决不能说有什么我们看不到的东西。——我们必须像别人一样说话，但不能像他们一样思考。
  267  The last proceeding of reason is to recognise that there is an infinity of things which are beyond it. 
 267 理性的最后一步是认识到有无限的事物超越它。
It is but feeble if it does not see so far as to know this. 
如果它不了解这一点，那么它就是软弱的。
But if natural things are beyond it, what will be said of supernatural?   268  _Submission._--We must know where to doubt, where to feel certain, where to submit. 
但如果自然的事物超出了它，那么超自然的事物又如何呢？ 268 _服从._--我们必须知道哪里该怀疑，哪里该确定，哪里该服从。
He who does not do so, understands not the force of reason. 
不这样做的人就无法理解理性的力量。
There are some who offend against these three rules, either by affirming everything as demonstrative, from want of knowing what demonstration is; or by doubting everything, from want of knowing where to submit; or by submitting in everything, from want of knowing where they must judge. 
有些人违反了这三个规则，要么因为不知道什么是论证而肯定一切都是论证性的；或者因为不知道该向哪里屈服而怀疑一切；或者因为不知道他们必须在哪里做出判断而在一切事情上都屈服。
  269  Submission is the use of reason in which consists true Christianity. 
 269 服从是对理性的运用，其中包含真正的基督教。
  270  _St. 
 270 _圣。
Augustine._[104]--Reason would never submit, if it did not judge that there are some occasions on which it ought to submit. 
奥古斯丁._[104]——理性永远不会屈服，如果它没有判断出在某些情况下它应该服从。
It is then right for it to submit, when it judges that it ought to submit. 
当它判断它应该服从时，它就服从了。
  271  Wisdom sends us to childhood. 
 271 智慧送我们回到童年。
_Nisi efficiamini sicut parvuli._[105]   272  There is nothing so conformable to reason as this disavowal of reason. 
 _Nisi efficamini sicut parvuli._[105] 272 没有什么比这种对理性的否定更符合理性了。
  273  If we submit everything to reason, our religion will have no mysterious and supernatural element. 
 273 如果我们一切都服从理性，我们的宗教就不会有神秘和超自然的成分。
If we offend the principles of reason, our religion will be absurd and ridiculous. 
如果我们违背了理性原则，我们的宗教就会变得荒谬可笑。
  274  All our reasoning reduces itself to yielding to feeling. 
 274 我们所有的推理都归结为屈服于感觉。
 But fancy is like, though contrary to feeling, so that we cannot distinguish between these contraries. 
但想象虽然与感觉相反，但却很相似，因此我们无法区分这些相反的东西。
One person says that my feeling is fancy, another that his fancy is feeling. 
一个人说我的感觉是幻想，另一个人说他的幻想是感觉。
We should have a rule. 
我们应该有一个规则。
Reason offers itself; but it is pliable in every sense; and thus there is no rule. 
理性本身就存在；但它在任何意义上都是柔韧的；因此没有规则。
  275  Men often take their imagination for their heart; and they believe they are converted as soon as they think of being converted. 
 275、人常以想象为心，他们相信，只要他们想到要悔改，他们就已经悔改了。
  276  M. 
 276 M。
"de Roannez said: ""Reasons come to me afterwards, but at first a thing pleases or shocks me without my knowing the reason, and yet it shocks me for that reason which I only discover afterwards."" But I believe, not that it shocked him for the reasons which were found afterwards, but that these reasons were only found because it shocks him. "
德·罗阿内斯说：“事后我才明白了原因，但一开始我不知道原因的情况下，一件事让我高兴或震惊，但它让我震惊的原因是我事后才发现的。”但我相信，并不是因为后来发现的原因才让他震惊，而是这些原因只是因为让他震惊才被发现的。
  277  The heart has its reasons, which reason does not know. 
277 心有其理，理所不知。
We feel it in a thousand things. 
我们在一千件事中感受到它。
I say that the heart naturally loves the Universal Being, and also itself naturally, according as it gives itself to them; and it hardens itself against one or the other at its will. 
我说，心自然地爱宇宙存在，也自然地爱它自己，因为它把自己奉献给了它们。并且它会根据自己的意愿强硬地对抗其中的一个或另一个。
You have rejected the one, and kept the other. 
你拒绝了一个，保留了另一个。
Is it by reason that you love yourself?   278  It is the heart which experiences God, and not the reason. 
是因为你爱自己吗？ 278 经历神的是心，而不是理性。
This, then, is faith: God felt by the heart, not by the reason. 
那么，这就是信仰：上帝是用心灵而不是理性来感受的。
  279  Faith is a gift of God; do not believe that we said it was a gift of reasoning. 
 279 信仰是神的恩赐；不要相信我们说这是推理的恩赐。
Other religions do not say this of their faith. 
其他宗教并不这么说他们的信仰。
They only gave reasoning in order to arrive at it, and yet it does not bring them to it. 
他们只是为了达到目的而给出推理，但推理并没有使他们达到目的。
  280  The knowledge of God is very far from the love of Him. 
 280 对神的认识与对神的爱相差甚远。
  281  Heart, instinct, principles. 
 281 心、本能、原则。
  282  We know truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart, and it is in this last way that we know first principles; and reason, which has no part in it, tries in vain to impugn them. 
282我们认识真理，不仅通过理性，而且通过心灵，通过这最后的方式，我们知道首要原则；理性虽然不参与其中，但徒劳地试图指责他们。
The sceptics, who have only this for their object, labour to no purpose. 
怀疑论者只以此为目标，但他们的努力是徒劳的。
We know that we do not dream, and however impossible it is for us to prove it by reason, this inability demonstrates only the weakness of our reason, but not, as they affirm, the uncertainty of all our knowledge. 
我们知道我们没有梦想，无论我们用理性证明它是多么不可能，这种无能只能表明我们理性的弱点，而不是像他们所断言的那样，表明我们所有知识的不确定性。
For the knowledge of first principles, as space, time, motion, number, is as sure as any of those which we get from reasoning. 
因为关于空间、时间、运动、数字等第一原理的知识，与我们从推理中获得的任何知识一样确定。
And reason must trust these intuitions of the heart, and must base them on every argument. 
理性必须相信这些内心的直觉，并且必须将它们建立在每一个论证的基础上。
(We have intuitive knowledge of the tri-dimensional nature of space, and of the infinity of number, and reason then shows that there are no two square numbers one of which is double of the other. 
 （我们对空间的三维性质和数字的无限性有直观的了解，然后推理表明不存在两个平方数，其中一个是另一个的两倍。
Principles are intuited, propositions are inferred, all with certainty, though in different ways.) And it is as useless and absurd for reason to demand from the heart proofs of her first principles, before admitting them, as it would be for the heart to demand from reason an intuition of all demonstrated propositions before accepting them. 
原则是直觉的，命题是推断的，尽管方式不同，但一切都是确定的。）理性在承认第一原则之前要求内心证明其最初的原则是无用和荒谬的，就像心灵对它们进行证明一样，是无用和荒谬的。在接受所有已论证的命题之前，要求理性对它们有直觉。
 This inability ought, then, to serve only to humble reason, which would judge all, but not to impugn our certainty, as if only reason were capable of instructing us. 
那么，这种无能只能服务于谦卑的理性，它会评判一切，但不能质疑我们的确定性，就好像只有理性才能指导我们一样。
Would to God, on the contrary, that we had never need of it, and that we knew everything by instinct and intuition! But nature has refused us this boon. 
相反，但愿上帝我们从来不需要它，我们凭本能和直觉知道一切！但大自然拒绝了我们这个恩惠。
On the contrary, she has given us but very little knowledge of this kind; and all the rest can be acquired only by reasoning. 
相反，她给我们的这方面的知识却非常少。其余的一切都只能通过推理来获得。
 Therefore, those to whom God has imparted religion by intuition are very fortunate, and justly convinced. 
因此，那些接受上帝凭直觉传授宗教信仰的人是非常幸运的，而且是理所当然的。
But to those who do not have it, we can give it only by reasoning, waiting for God to give them spiritual insight, without which faith is only human, and useless for salvation. 
但对于那些没有信心的人，我们只能通过推理来给予，等待神赐予他们属灵的洞察力，没有这种洞察力，信心只是人性的，对于得救毫无用处。
  283  _Order.--Against the objection that Scripture has no order._  The heart has its own order; the intellect has its own, which is by principle and demonstration. 
 283_秩序。——反对圣经没有秩序的反对意见。_心有它自己的秩序；智力有它自己的，它是基于原则和论证的。
The heart has another. 
心还有另一个。
We do not prove that we ought to be loved by enumerating in order the causes of love; that would be ridiculous. 
我们并不是通过按顺序列举爱的原因来证明我们应该被爱；那太荒谬了。
 Jesus Christ and Saint Paul employ the rule of love, not of intellect; for they would warm, not instruct. 
耶稣基督和圣保罗运用的是爱的规则，而不是智力的规则。因为他们会温暖，而不是指导。
It is the same with Saint Augustine. 
圣奥古斯丁也是如此。
This order consists chiefly in digressions on each point to indicate the end, and keep it always in sight. 
这个顺序主要包括在每一点上的离题以表明结局，并使其始终处于可见状态。
  284  Do not wonder to see simple people believe without reasoning. 
 284 不要奇怪看到简单的人不加推理就相信。
God imparts to them love of Him and hatred of self. 
神赋予他们对他的爱和对自我的恨。
He inclines their heart to believe. 
他使他们的心相信。
Men will never believe with a saving and real faith, unless God inclines their heart; and they will believe as soon as He inclines it. 
除非神感动他们的心，否则人永远不会怀着得救的真实信心去相信。只要他愿意，他们就会相信。
And this is what David knew well, when he said: _Inclina cor meum, Deus, in ..._[106]   285  Religion is suited to all kinds of minds. 
这就是大卫所熟知的，当他说：_Inclina cor meum，Deus，in ..._[106] 285 宗教适合各种思想。
Some pay attention only to its establishment,[107] and this religion is such that its very establishment suffices to prove its truth. 
有些人只关注它的建立，[107]而这个宗教正是这样，它的建立本身就足以证明它的真理。
Others trace it even to the apostles. 
其他人甚至将其追溯到使徒。
The more learned go back to the beginning of the world. 
学识越多的人可以回到世界之初。
The angels see it better still, and from a more distant time. 
天使们在更遥远的时间里看得更清楚。
  286  Those who believe without having read the Testaments, do so because they have an inward disposition entirely holy, and all that they hear of our religion conforms to it. 
 286 那些没有读过《圣经》而相信的人，是因为他们有完全圣洁的内在性情，他们所听到的我们宗教的一切都符合它。
They feel that a God has made them; they desire only to love God; they desire to hate themselves only. 
他们觉得是上帝创造了他们；他们只渴望爱神；他们只想恨自己。
They feel that they have no strength in themselves; that they are incapable of coming to God; and that if God does not come to them, they can have no communion with Him. 
他们觉得自己没有力量；他们无法来到上帝面前；如果神不临到他们，他们就无法与神相交。
And they hear our religion say that men must love God only, and hate self only; but that all being corrupt and unworthy of God, God made Himself man to unite Himself to us. 
他们听到我们的宗教说，人必须只爱上帝，只恨自己；但所有的人都败坏了，不配上帝，所以上帝使自己成为人，以便将自己与我们联合起来。
No more is required to persuade men who have this disposition in their heart, and who have this knowledge of their duty and of their inefficiency. 
无需再说服那些内心有这种倾向、了解自己的职责和无效率的人。
  287  Those whom we see to be Christians without the knowledge of the prophets and evidences, nevertheless judge of their religion as well as those who have that knowledge. 
 287 那些我们在不了解先知和证据的情况下被视为基督徒的人，仍然可以像那些拥有这些知识的人一样判断他们的宗教。
They judge of it by the heart, as others judge of it by the intellect. 
他们用心灵来判断，就像其他人用智力来判断一样。
God Himself inclines them to believe, and thus they are most effectively convinced. 
神亲自引导他们相信，因此他们最有效地被说服。
 I confess indeed that one of those Christians who believe without proofs will not perhaps be capable of convincing an infidel who will say the same of himself. 
我确实承认，那些没有证据就相信的基督徒中的一个人也许无法说服一个对自己说同样话的异教徒。
But those who know the proofs of religion will prove without difficulty that such a believer is truly inspired by God, though he cannot prove it himself. 
但那些知道宗教证据的人会毫不费力地证明这样的信徒确实是受上帝启发的，尽管他自己无法证明这一点。
 For God having said in His prophecies (which are undoubtedly prophecies), that in the reign of Jesus Christ He would spread His spirit abroad among nations, and that the youths and maidens and children of the Church would prophesy;[108] it is certain that the Spirit of God is in these, and not in the others. 
因为上帝在他的预言中说过（毫无疑问是预言），在耶稣基督的统治下，他将在各国传播他的精神，教会的青年、少女和儿童也会预言；[108]这是肯定的神的灵在这些人里面，而不是在其他人里面。
  288  Instead of complaining that God had hidden Himself, you will give Him thanks for having revealed so much of Himself; and you will also give Him thanks for not having revealed Himself to haughty sages, unworthy to know so holy a God. 
 288 你不再埋怨神隐藏了自己，而是感谢神将自己揭示了这么多；你也会感谢他没有向傲慢的圣人显现自己，因为他们不配认识如此圣洁的上帝。
 Two kinds of persons know Him: those who have a humble heart, and who love lowliness, whatever kind of intellect they may have, high or low; and those who have sufficient understanding to see the truth, whatever opposition they may have to it. 
有两种人认识他：心谦卑、喜爱卑微的人，无论他们的智力高低；以及那些有足够的理解力来看到真相的人，无论他们可能有什么反对意见。

    SECTION V  JUSTICE AND THE REASON OF EFFECTS   291  In the letter _On Injustice_ can come the ridiculousness of the law that the elder gets all. 
第五节正义和影响的原因 291 在《论不正义》这封信中，可以看出长老得到一切的法律的荒谬性。
"My friend, you were born on this side of the mountain, it is therefore just that your elder brother gets everything.  ""Why do you kill me?""   292  He lives on the other side of the water. "
朋友，你生在山这边，所以一切都是你哥哥得到的。 “你为什么要杀我？” 292 他住在水的另一边。
"  293  ""Why do you kill me? What! do you not live on the other side of the water? If you lived on this side, my friend, I should be an assassin, and it would be unjust to slay you in this manner. "
第293章 你为什么要杀我？什么！你不是住在水的那边吗？如果你住在这边，我的朋友，我就应该是个刺客，这样杀你就太不公平了。
"But since you live on the other side, I am a hero, and it is just.""   294  On what shall man found the order of the world which he would govern?[109] Shall it be on the caprice of each individual? What confusion! Shall it be on justice? Man is ignorant of it. "
但既然你住在另一边，我就是一个英雄，这是正义的。”294 人类将如何建立他将统治的世界的秩序？ [109] 它应该取决于每个人的任性吗？混乱！正义吗？人类对此一无所知。
 Certainly had he known it, he would not have established this maxim, the most general of all that obtain among men, that each should follow the custom of his own country. 
当然，如果他知道这一点，他就不会制定这条人类中最普遍的格言：每个人都应该遵循自己国家的习俗。
The glory of true equity would have brought all nations under subjection, and legislators would not have taken as their model the fancies and caprice of Persians and Germans instead of this unchanging justice. 
真正公平的荣耀将使所有国家都臣服，立法者不会以波斯人和德国人的幻想和任性为榜样，而是以这种不变的正义为榜样。
We should have seen it set up in all the States on earth and in all times; whereas we see neither justice nor injustice which does not change its nature with change in climate. 
我们应该看到它在地球上所有国家和所有时代都建立起来；然而，我们既看不到正义，也看不到非正义，它们的性质不会随着气候的变化而改变。
Three degrees of latitude reverse all jurisprudence; a meridian decides the truth. 
三度纬度推翻所有法理；经络决定真理。
Fundamental laws change after a few years of possession; right has its epochs; the entry of Saturn into the Lion marks to us the origin of such and such a crime. 
基本法律在拥有几年后就会发生变化；权利有它的时代；土星进入狮子对我们来说标志着这样那样的犯罪的起源。
A strange justice that is bounded by a river! Truth on this side of the Pyrenees, error on the other side. 
一个以河为界的奇怪正义！真理在比利牛斯山脉的这一边，错误在另一边。
 Men admit that justice does not consist in these customs, but that it resides in natural laws, common to every country. 
人们承认正义并不在于这些习俗，而是存在于每个国家共同的自然法中。
They would certainly maintain it obstinately, if reckless chance which has distributed human laws had encountered even one which was universal; but the farce is that the caprice of men has so many vagaries that there is no such law. 
如果分配人类法律的鲁莽的偶然性遇到了即使是普遍适用的法律，他们也肯定会顽固地维持它。但可笑的是，人的反复无常有如此多的变幻无常，以至于没有这样的法律。
 Theft, incest, infanticide, parricide, have all had a place among virtuous actions. 
盗窃、乱伦、杀婴、弑父，都在善行中占有一席之地。
Can anything be more ridiculous than that a man should have the right to kill me because he lives on the other side of the water, and because his ruler has a quarrel with mine, though I have none with him?  Doubtless there are natural laws; but good reason once corrupted has corrupted all. 
一个人因为住在水的另一边，因为他的统治者与我的统治者有争执，而我与他没有任何争执，所以他就有权杀我，还有什么比这更可笑的呢？毫无疑问，有自然法则；但正当的理由一旦腐败，就已经腐败了一切。
_Nihil amplius nostrum est;[110] quod nostrum dicimus, artis est. 
 _Nihil amplius nostrum est;[110] quod nostrum dicimus, artis est。
Ex senatus--consultis et plebiscitis crimina exercentur.[111] Ut olim vitiis, sic nunc legibus laboramus._[112]  The result of this confusion is that one affirms the essence of justice to be the authority of the legislator; another, the interest of the sovereign;[113] another, present custom,[114] and this is the most sure. 
Ex natus--consultis et plebiscitis crimina exercentur.[111] Ut olim vitiis, sic nunc lawibus Laboramus._[112] 这种混乱的结果是人们肯定正义的本质是立法者的权威；另一个是主权者的利益；[113]另一个是现行习俗，[114]这是最确定的。
Nothing, according to reason alone, is just in itself; all changes with time. 
仅凭理性而言，没有什么东西本身是正义的。一切都随着时间而改变。
Custom creates the whole of equity, for the simple reason that it is accepted. 
习俗创造了全部的公平，原因很简单，那就是它被接受了。
It is the mystical foundation of its authority;[115] whoever carries it back to first principles destroys it. 
它是其权威的神秘基础；[115] 谁将它带回到首要原则，谁就会摧毁它。
Nothing is so faulty as those laws which correct faults. 
没有什么比纠正错误的法律更错误的了。
He who obeys them because they are just, obeys a justice which is imaginary, and not the essence of law; it is quite self-contained, it is law and nothing more. 
那些因为正义而服从它们的人，服从的是想象中的正义，而不是法律的本质。它是相当独立的，它只是法律，仅此而已。
He who will examine its motive will find it so feeble and so trifling that if he be not accustomed to contemplate the wonders of human imagination, he will marvel that one century has gained for it so much pomp and reverence. 
凡是审视其动机的人，都会发现它是如此软弱和微不足道，如果他不习惯思考人类想象力的奇迹，他会惊叹一个世纪以来它获得了如此多的盛况和崇敬。
The art of opposition and of revolution is to unsettle established customs, sounding them even to their source, to point out their want of authority and justice. 
反对和革命的艺术就是动摇既定的习俗，甚至探寻它们的根源，指出它们对权威和正义的缺乏。
We must, it is said, get back to the natural and fundamental laws of the State, which an unjust custom has abolished. 
据说，我们必须回到国家的自然法和基本法，而这些法已经被不公正的习俗废除了。
It is a game certain to result in the loss of all; nothing will be just on the balance. 
这是一场注定会输掉一切的游戏；没有什么是平衡的。
Yet people readily lend their ear to such arguments. 
然而人们很乐意倾听这样的论点。
They shake off the yoke as soon as they recognise it; and the great profit by their ruin, and by that of these curious investigators of accepted customs. 
他们一认识到枷锁就挣脱了；以及他们的毁灭和这些对公认习俗的好奇调查者的巨大利润。
But from a contrary mistake men sometimes think they can justly do everything which is not without an example. 
但由于相反的错误，人们有时认为他们可以公正地做每件事，这并非没有榜样。
That is why the wisest of legislators[116] said that it was necessary to deceive men for their own good; and another, a good politician, _Cum veritatem qua liberetur ignoret, expedit quod fallatur._[117] We must not see the fact of usurpation; law was once introduced without reason, and has become reasonable. 
这就是为什么最明智的立法者[116]说为了自己的利益而欺骗人们是必要的；另一位是一位优秀的政治家，_Cum veritatem qua libereturignet, expedit quodfallatur._[117] 我们决不能看到篡夺的事实；我们不能看到篡夺的事实。法律曾经无缘无故地被引入，现在已经变得合理了。
We must make it regarded as authoritative, eternal, and conceal its origin, if we do not wish that it should soon come to an end. 
如果我们不希望它很快结束，我们就必须让它被视为权威的、永恒的，并隐藏它的起源。
"  295  _Mine, thine._--""This dog is mine,"" said those poor children; ""that is my place in the sun."" Here is the beginning and the image of the usurpation of all the earth. "
 295 _我的，你的。_--“这只狗是我的，”那些可怜的孩子们说； “那是我在阳光下的地方。”这是侵占整个地球的开始和形象。
  296  When the question for consideration is whether we ought to make war, and kill so many men--condemn so many Spaniards to death--only one man is judge, and he is an interested party. 
 296 当要考虑的问题是我们是否应该发动战争并杀死这么多人——判处这么多西班牙人死刑时，只有一个人是法官，他是利益相关者。
There should be a third, who is disinterested. 
应该有第三个，他是无私的。
  297  _Veri juris._[118]--We have it no more; if we had it, we should take conformity to the customs of a country as the rule of justice. 
297 _Veri juris._[118]--我们不再有它了；如果我们有的话，我们就应该以符合一个国家的风俗作为正义的规则。
It is here that, not finding justice, we have found force, etc. 
正是在这里，我们没有找到正义，而是找到了武力，等等。
  298  _Justice, might._--It is right that what is just should be obeyed; it is necessary that what is strongest should be obeyed. 
 298_正义，强权。_--正义的事，应当服从，这是理所应当的；必须服从最强者。
Justice without might is helpless; might without justice is tyrannical. 
正义没有力量，是无能为力的；没有正义的强权就是暴虐。
Justice without might is gainsaid, because there are always offenders; might without justice is condemned. 
没有强权的正义是不可否认的，因为总有罪犯；没有正义的强权就会受到谴责。
We must then combine justice and might, and for this end make what is just strong, or what is strong just. 
然后，我们必须将正义与强权结合起来，为此目的，使正义成为强者，或者使强者成为正义者。
 Justice is subject to dispute; might is easily recognised and is not disputed. 
正义有争议；权力很容易被认可并且没有争议。
So we cannot give might to justice, because might has gainsaid justice, and has declared that it is she herself who is just. 
所以我们不能把强权赋予正义，因为强权已经否定了正义，并宣称她自己才是正义的。
And thus being unable to make what is just strong, we have made what is strong just. 
因此，我们无法使事物变得坚强，但我们却使事物变得坚强。
  299  The only universal rules are the laws of the country in ordinary affairs, and of the majority in others. 
299 唯一的普遍规则是普通事务中的国家法律，以及其他事务中的大多数人的法律。
Whence comes this? From the might which is in them. 
这是从哪里来的？来自他们内心的力量。
Hence it comes that kings, who have power of a different kind, do not follow the majority of their ministers. 
因此，拥有不同权力的国王并不追随大多数大臣。
 No doubt equality of goods is just; but, being unable to cause might to obey justice, men have made it just to obey might. 
毫无疑问，商品平等是正义的；但是，由于无法使强权服从正义，人们只能服从强权。
Unable to strengthen justice, they have justified might; so that the just and the strong should unite, and there should be peace, which is the sovereign good. 
他们无法加强正义，却为强权辩护；所以正义与强者应该联合起来，和平才是至高无上的利益。
"  300  ""When a strong man armed keepeth his goods, his goods are in peace.""[119]   301  Why do we follow the majority? It is because they have more reason? No, because they have more power. "
 300 “当一个强人武装起来保管他的财产时，他的财产就处于和平状态。”[119] 301 为什么我们要追随大多数人？是因为他们有更多的理由吗？不，因为他们有更多的权力。
 Why do we follow the ancient laws and opinions? Is it because they are more sound? No, but because they are unique, and remove from us the root of difference. 
为什么我们要遵循古老的法律和观点？是因为它们更健全吗？不，但因为它们是独一无二的，并且消除了我们差异的根源。
  302  ... 
 302 ...
It is the effect of might, not of custom. 
这是力量的结果，而不是习惯的结果。
For those who are capable of originality are few; the greater number will only follow, and refuse glory to those inventors who seek it by their inventions. 
因为有独创性的人是少数；更多的人只会效仿，并拒绝那些通过发明寻求荣耀的发明家的荣耀。
And if these are obstinate in their wish to obtain glory, and despise those who do not invent, the latter will call them ridiculous names, and would beat them with a stick. 
如果这些人固执地想获得荣耀，而蔑视那些不发明的人，后者就会骂他们可笑的名字，并用棍子打他们。
Let no one then boast of his subtlety, or let him keep his complacency to himself. 
任何人都不要夸耀他的狡猾，也不要让他自满。
  303  Might is the sovereign of the world, and not opinion.--But opinion makes use of might.--It is might that makes opinion. 
 303 世界的主宰是力量，而不是意见。——但是意见利用力量。——是力量产生意见。
Gentleness is beautiful in our opinion. 
在我们看来，温柔是美丽的。
Why? Because he who will dance on a rope will be alone,[120] and I will gather a stronger mob of people who will say that it is unbecoming. 
为什么？因为在绳子上跳舞的人将是孤独的，[120] 我将聚集一群更强大的人，他们会说这是不合适的。
  304  The cords which bind the respect of men to each other are in general cords of necessity; for there must be different degrees, all men wishing to rule, and not all being able to do so, but some being able. 
 304 将人与人之间的尊重联系在一起的绳索一般来说是必要的绳索；因为必须有不同的程度，所有人都希望统治，但并非所有人都能做到，但有些人能够。
 Let us then imagine we see society in the process of formation. 
让我们想象一下我们所看到的社会正在形成的过程。
Men will doubtless fight till the stronger party overcomes the weaker, and a dominant party is established. 
人们无疑会战斗，直到强者战胜弱者，建立一个占主导地位的政党。
But when this is once determined, the masters, who do not desire the continuation of strife, then decree that the power which is in their hands shall be transmitted as they please. 
但是，一旦决定了，那些不希望冲突继续下去的主人就会下令，将他们手中的权力按照他们的意愿转移。
Some place it in election by the people, others in hereditary succession, etc. 
有的由人民选举产生，有的则由世袭继承，等等。
 And this is the point where imagination begins to play its part. 
这就是想象力开始发挥作用的时刻。
Till now power makes fact; now power is sustained by imagination in a certain party, in France in the nobility, in Switzerland in the burgesses, etc. 
到目前为止，权力创造事实；现在，某个政党的权力是靠想象力来维持的，在法国是贵族，在瑞士是平民，等等。
 These cords which bind the respect of men to such and such an individual are therefore the cords of imagination. 
因此，这些将人们的尊重与某某个人联系起来的绳索就是想象力的绳索。
  305  The Swiss are offended by being called gentlemen, and prove themselves true plebeians in order to be thought worthy of great office. 
 305 瑞士人因被称为绅士而感到冒犯，并证明自己是真正的平民，以便被认为值得担任伟大的职务。
  306  As duchies, kingships, and magistracies are real and necessary, because might rules all, they exist everywhere and always. 
306 由于公国、王权和行政长官是真实且必要的，因为强权统治一切，所以它们无处不在、永远存在。
But since only caprice makes such and such a one a ruler, the principle is not constant, but subject to variation, etc. 
但是，由于只有任性才能使某个人成为统治者，所以原则不是恒定的，而是可能变化的，等等。
  307  The chancellor is grave, and clothed with ornaments, for his position is unreal. 
 307 宰相很严肃，戴着装饰品，因为他的地位不真实。

国王则不然，他有权力，与想象无关。
Judges, physicians, etc. 
法官、医生等
appeal only to the imagination. 
只诉诸想象力。
  308  The habit of seeing kings accompanied by guards, drums, officers, and all the paraphernalia which mechanically inspire respect and awe, makes their countenance, when sometimes seen alone without these accompaniments, impress respect and awe on their subjects; because we cannot separate in thought their persons from the surroundings with which we see them usually joined. 
 308 看到国王有卫兵、鼓、军官和所有自然而然地激发尊重和敬畏的用具陪伴的习惯，使得他们的面容，有时在没有这些伴奏的情况下单独看到时，给他们的臣民留下了尊重和敬畏的印象；因为我们无法在思想上将他们的人与我们通常看到的他们所身处的环境分开。
"And the world, which knows not that this effect is the result of habit, believes that it arises by a natural force, whence come these words, ""The character of Divinity is stamped on his countenance,"" etc. "
而世人不知道这种效果是习惯的结果，却相信它是由自然力量产生的，因此出现了“神性的特征印在他的脸上”等话。
  309  _Justice._--As custom determines what is agreeable, so also does it determine justice. 
 309_正义._--正如习惯决定什么是令人愉快的，它也决定正义。

  311  The government founded on opinion and imagination reigns for some time, and this government is pleasant and voluntary; that founded on might lasts for ever. 
 311 建立在舆论和想象之上的政府统治了一段时间，这个政府是愉快的、自愿的；建立在力量之上的力量将永远持续下去。
Thus opinion is the queen of the world, but might is its tyrant. 
因此，舆论是世界的女王，而强权则是世界的暴君。
  312  Justice is what is established; and thus all our established laws will necessarily be regarded as just without examination, since they are established. 
第312章 正义既定；因此，我们所有既定的法律必然会被认为是公正的，无需审查，因为它们是既定的。

Recognise then and learn that you are only a king of lust, and take the ways of lust. 
然后认识并了解你只是一个色欲之王，并采取色欲之道。
  315  _The reason of effects._--It is wonderful that men would not have me honour a man clothed in brocade, and followed by seven or eight lackeys! Why! He will have me thrashed, if I do not salute him. 
第315章_效果的原因。_--人们不愿意让我尊敬一个穿着锦衣、身后跟着七八个走狗的人，这真是太好了！为什么！如果我不向他敬礼，他就会痛打我。
This custom is a force. 
这种习俗是一种力量。
It is the same with a horse in fine trappings in comparison with another! Montaigne[122] is a fool not to see what difference there is, to wonder at our finding any, and to ask the reason. 
这就像一匹穿着精美服饰的马与另一匹马相比一样！蒙田[122]是个傻瓜，他没有看到有什么区别，对我们的发现感到惊讶，并询问原因。

To be spruce is to show one's power. 
打扮得漂漂亮亮，就是展现自己的实力。
"  317  Deference means, ""Put yourself to inconvenience."" This is apparently silly, but is quite right. "
317 尊重的意思是：“给自己带来不便。”这显然是愚蠢的，但却是非常正确的。
"For it is to say, ""I would indeed put myself to inconvenience if you required it, since indeed I do so when it is of no service to you."" Deference further serves to distinguish the great. "
因为它的意思是：“如果你需要的话，我确实会给自己带来不便，因为事实上，当它对你没有任何帮助时，我就会这样做。”尊重进一步有助于区分伟人。
Now if deference was displayed by sitting in an arm-chair, we should show deference to everybody, and so no distinction would be made; but, being put to inconvenience, we distinguish very well. 
现在，如果通过坐在扶手椅上来表示尊重，那么我们应该对每个人表示尊重，因此不会有任何区别；但是，由于不方便，我们区分得很好。
  318  He has four lackeys. 
 318 他有四个跟班。
  319  How rightly do we distinguish men by external appearances rather than by internal qualities! Which of us two shall have precedence? Who will give place to the other? The least clever. 
 319 我们以外表而不是内在品质来区分人是多么正确！我们两个谁优先？谁会给另一个让位？最不聪明的。
But I am as clever as he. 
但我和他一样聪明。
We should have to fight over this. 
我们应该为此而斗争。
He has four lackeys, and I have only one. 
他有四个走狗，而我只有一个。
This can be seen; we have only to count. 
这可以看出；我们只需数数即可。
It falls to me to yield, and I am a fool if I contest the matter. 
我必须屈服，如果我对此提出异议，我就是个傻瓜。
By this means we are at peace, which is the greatest of boons. 
通过这种方式，我们可以得到平静，这是最大的恩赐。
  320  The most unreasonable things in the world become most reasonable, because of the unruliness of men. 
 320 世间最不合理的事，因为人的不守规矩而变得最合理。
What is less reasonable than to choose the eldest son of a queen to rule a State? We do not choose as captain of a ship the passenger who is of the best family. 
还有什么比选择女王的长子来统治国家更不合理的呢？我们不会选择出身最好的乘客作为船长。
 This law would be absurd and unjust; but because men are so themselves, and always will be so, it becomes reasonable and just. 
这项法律是荒谬且不公正的；但因为人本身就是如此，并且永远如此，所以它就变得合理和公正。
For whom will men choose, as the most virtuous and able? We at once come to blows, as each claims to be the most virtuous and able. 
人们会选择谁作为最有德行、最有能力的人呢？我们立刻就打了起来，因为每个人都声称自己是最有道德和最有能力的人。
Let us then attach this quality to something indisputable. 
那么让我们将这种品质赋予一些无可争议的东西。
This is the king's eldest son. 
这是国王的长子。
That is clear, and there is no dispute. 
这是很清楚的，没有任何争议。
Reason can do no better, for civil war is the greatest of evils. 
理性不能做得更好，因为内战是最大的罪恶。
  321  Children are astonished to see their comrades respected. 
 321 孩子们惊讶地发现他们的同志受到尊重。
  322  To be of noble birth is a great advantage. 
 322 出身高贵是一大优势。
In eighteen years it places a man within the select circle, known and respected, as another would have merited in fifty years. 
在十八年的时间里，它把一个人置于精选的圈子里，为人所知并受到尊重，就像另一个人在五十年里应该得到的那样。
It is a gain of thirty years without trouble. 
这是无忧无虑的三十年的收获。
  323  What is the Ego?  Suppose a man puts himself at a window to see those who pass by. 
第323章什么是自我？假设一个人站在窗前观察路过的人。
If I pass by, can I say that he placed himself there to see me? No; for he does not think of me in particular. 
如果我路过的话，我能说他是专门来看我的吗？不;因为他并不特别想我。
But does he who loves someone on account of beauty really love that person? No; for the small-pox, which will kill beauty without killing the person, will cause him to love her no more. 
但因为美丽而爱一个人的人真的爱那个人吗？不;因为天花会杀死美丽，但不会杀死人，它会让他不再爱她。
 And if one loves me for my judgment, memory, he does not love _me_, for I can lose these qualities without losing myself. 
如果有人因为我的判断力、记忆力而爱我，那么他就不会爱我，因为我可以在不失去自己的情况下失去这些品质。
Where, then, is this Ego, if it be neither in the body nor in the soul? And how love the body or the soul, except for these qualities which do not constitute _me_, since they are perishable? For it is impossible and would be unjust to love the soul of a person in the abstract, and whatever qualities might be therein. 
那么，如果这个自我既不在身体中也不在灵魂中，那么它在哪里呢？怎样爱身体或灵魂，除了这些不构成我的品质，因为它们是易逝的？因为抽象地爱一个人的灵魂以及其中可能具有的品质是不可能的，也是不公正的。
We never, then, love a person, but only qualities. 
那么，我们爱的从来不是一个人，而是爱一个人的品质。
 Let us, then, jeer no more at those who are honoured on account of rank and office; for we love a person only on account of borrowed qualities. 
那么，让我们不要再嘲笑那些因等级和职位而受到尊敬的人了；因为我们爱一个人只是因为借来的品质。
  324  The people have very sound opinions, for example:  1. 
 324 人民有非常好的意见，例如： 1.
In having preferred diversion and hunting to poetry. 
比起诗歌，更喜欢消遣和狩猎。
The half-learned laugh at it, and glory in being above the folly of the world; but the people are right for a reason which these do not fathom. 
半学问者嘲笑它，并以超越世界的愚蠢而自豪；但人民是正确的，其理由却是他们无法理解的。

In having distinguished men by external marks, as birth or wealth. 
通过外在标志（例如出身或财富）来区分人。
The world again exults in showing how unreasonable this is; but it is very reasonable. 
世界再次欣喜地表明这是多么不合理；但这是非常合理的。
Savages laugh at an infant king.[123]  3. 
野蛮人嘲笑婴儿国王。[123] 3.
In being offended at a blow, on in desiring glory so much. 
受到一击冒犯，又如此渴望荣耀。
But it is very desirable on account of the other essential goods which are joined to it; and a man who has received a blow, without resenting it, is overwhelmed with taunts and indignities. 
但考虑到与之相关的其他必需品，它是非常可取的。一个受到打击的人，如果没有怨恨，就会被嘲笑和侮辱所淹没。

In working for the uncertain; in sailing on the sea; in walking over a plank. 
为不确定的事情而工作；在海上航行时；走过一块木板。
  325  Montaigne is wrong. 
 325 蒙田是错误的。
Custom should be followed only because it is custom, and not because it is reasonable or just. 
应该遵循习惯只是因为它是习惯，而不是因为它合理或公正。
But people follow it for this sole reason, that they think it just. 
但人们遵循它的唯一原因是，他们认为它是公正的。
Otherwise they would follow it no longer, although it were the custom; for they will only submit to reason or justice. 
否则他们将不再遵循它，尽管这是习俗；因为他们只会服从理性或正义。
Custom without this would pass for tyranny; but the sovereignty of reason and justice is no more tyrannical than that of desire. 
没有这一点的习俗就会被视为暴政；但理性和正义的主权并不比欲望的主权更专制。
They are principles natural to man. 
它们是人类自然的原则。
 It would therefore be right to obey laws and customs, because they are laws; but we should know that there is neither truth nor justice to introduce into them, that we know nothing of these, and so must follow what is accepted. 
因此，遵守法律和习俗是正确的，因为它们就是法律；但我们应该知道，它们既没有真理也没有正义可以引入，我们对此一无所知，因此必须遵循公认的内容。
By this means we would never depart from them. 
这样我们就永远不会离开他们。
But people cannot accept this doctrine; and, as they believe that truth can be found, and that it exists in law and custom, they believe them, and take their antiquity as a proof of their truth, and not simply of their authority apart from truth. 
但人们不能接受这个学说；而且，由于他们相信真理是可以找到的，并且真理存在于法律和习俗中，因此他们相信这些真理，并把它们的古老性作为其真理的证明，而不仅仅是真理之外的权威的证明。
Thus they obey laws, but they are liable to revolt when these are proved to be valueless; and this can be shown of all, looked at from a certain aspect. 
因此，他们遵守法律，但当这些法律被证明毫无价值时，他们很容易反抗。从某个方面来看，这一切都可以表现出来。
  326  _Injustice._--It is dangerous to tell the people that the laws are unjust; for they obey them only because they think them just. 
 326 _Injustice._--告诉人们法律不公正是危险的；因为他们服从这些规则只是因为他们认为这些规则是正义的。
Therefore it is necessary to tell them at the same time that they must obey them because they are laws, just as they must obey superiors, not because they are just, but because they are superiors. 
因此，有必要同时告诉他们，他们必须服从这些法律，因为它们是法律，就像他们必须服从上级一样，不是因为他们是正义的，而是因为他们是上级。
In this way all sedition is prevented, if this can be made intelligible, and it be understood what is the proper definition of justice. 
通过这种方式，所有的煽动叛乱都会被阻止，如果这可以被理解，并且可以理解什么是正义的正确定义。
  327  The world is a good judge of things, for it is in natural ignorance, which is man's true state.[124] The sciences have two extremes which meet. 
 327 世界是事物的善评判者，因为它处于自然的无知之中，这才是人类的真实状态。 [124]科学有两个相交的极端。
The first is the pure natural ignorance in which all men find themselves at birth. 
第一个是所有人出生时都发现自己的纯粹自然的无知。
The other extreme is that reached by great intellects, who, having run through all that men can know, find they know nothing, and come back again to that same ignorance from which they set out; but this is a learned ignorance which is conscious of itself. 
另一个极端是伟大的知识分子所达到的，他们在浏览了人类所能知道的一切之后，发现自己一无所知，然后又回到了他们出发时的无知状态。但这是一种有意识的习得性无知。
Those between the two, who have departed from natural ignorance and not been able to reach the other, have some smattering of this vain knowledge, and pretend to be wise. 
两者之间的人，已经脱离了自然的无知，无法到达对方，对这种虚无的知识有所了解，并假装聪明。
These trouble the world, and are bad judges of everything. 
这些人给世界带来麻烦，对一切事物都是错误的判断。
The people and the wise constitute the world; these despise it, and are despised. 
百姓与智者，构成世界；这些人鄙视它，并且被鄙视。
They judge badly of everything, and the world judges rightly of them. 
他们对一切的评价都很糟糕，而世界对他们的评价却是正确的。
  328  _The reason of effects._--Continual alternation of pro and con. 
第328章_影响的原因_--赞成与反对的不断交替。
 We have then shown that man is foolish, by the estimation he makes of things which are not essential; and all these opinions are destroyed. 
我们已经表明，人对不重要的事物的评价是愚蠢的。所有这些意见都被摧毁了。
We have next shown that all these opinions are very sound, and that thus, since all these vanities are well founded, the people are not so foolish as is said. 
接下来我们已经表明，所有这些意见都是非常合理的，因此，既然所有这些虚荣心都是有根据的，那么人们并不像所说的那么愚蠢。
And so we have destroyed the opinion which destroyed that of the people. 
因此，我们摧毁了那些摧毁了人民观点的观点。
 But we must now destroy this last proposition, and show that it remains always true that the people are foolish, though their opinions are sound; because they do not perceive the truth where it is, and, as they place it where it is not, their opinions are always very false and very unsound. 
但我们现在必须推翻这最后一个主张，并表明，尽管人民的意见是正确的，但他们仍然是愚蠢的。因为他们看不到真理所在，而且当他们把真理放在不正确的地方时，他们的观点总是非常错误和非常不合理的。
  329  _The reason of effects._--The weakness of man is the reason why so many things are considered fine, as to be good at playing the lute. 
 329_效果的原因。_--人的弱点是许多事情被认为很好的原因，就像擅长弹琵琶一样。
It is only an evil because of our weakness. 
这只是因为我们的软弱而造成的邪恶。
  330  The power of kings is founded on the reason and on the folly of the people, and specially on their folly. 
 330 国王的权力建立在人民的理性和愚昧之上，特别是他们的愚昧之上。
The greatest and most important thing in the world has weakness for its foundation, and this foundation is wonderfully sure; for there is nothing more sure than this, that the people will be weak. 
世界上最伟大、最重要的事物都有其基础的弱点，而这个基础又是极其可靠的。因为没有什么比这更确定的了：人民将变得软弱。
What is based on sound reason is very ill founded, as the estimate of wisdom. 
正如对智慧的评价一样，基于合理理性的东西是非常站不住脚的。
  331  We can only think of Plato and Aristotle in grand academic robes. 
 331 我们只能想到身着盛大学术长袍的柏拉图和亚里士多德。
They were honest men, like others, laughing with their friends, and when they diverted themselves with writing their _Laws_ and the _Politics_, they did it as an amusement. 
他们是诚实的人，像其他人一样，与朋友一起欢笑，当他们用写_法律_和_政治_来消遣时，他们把它当作一种娱乐。
That part of their life was the least philosophic and the least serious; the most philosophic was to live simply and quietly. 
他们生活的那部分是最不哲学、最不严肃的。最有哲理的就是简单安静地生活。
If they wrote on politics, it was as if laying down rules for a lunatic asylum; and if they presented the appearance of speaking of a great matter, it was because they knew that the madmen, to whom they spoke, thought they were kings and emperors. 
如果他们写的是政治，就好像为疯人院制定了规则；如果他们表现出在谈论一件大事的样子，那是因为他们知道，与他们交谈的疯子认为他们是国王和皇帝。
They entered into their principles in order to make their madness as little harmful as possible. 
他们遵守自己的原则，是为了尽可能减少自己的疯狂带来的危害。
  332  Tyranny consists in the desire of universal power beyond its scope. 
 332 暴政在于对超出其范围的普遍权力的渴望。
 There are different assemblies of the strong, the fair, the sensible, the pious, in which each man rules at home, not elsewhere. 
有不同的强者、公平者、明智者、虔诚者的集会，每个人都在自己的家中统治，而不是在其他地方。
And sometimes they meet, and the strong and the fair foolishly fight as to who shall be master, for their mastery is of different kinds. 
有时他们相遇，强者和美人会愚蠢地争夺谁将成为主人，因为他们的主人是不同类型的。
They do not understand one another, and their fault is the desire to rule everywhere. 
他们彼此不理解，他们的错误在于统治一切的欲望。
Nothing can effect this, not even might, which is of no use in the kingdom of the wise, and is only mistress of external actions. 
任何事物都无法实现这一点，甚至连力量也无法做到这一点，因为力量在智者的王国中毫无用处，而只是外在行为的主宰。
 _Tyranny_--... 
 _暴政_ - ...
"So these expressions are false and tyrannical: ""I am fair, therefore I must be feared. "
所以这些说法是虚假和专横的：“我是公平的，所以我必须被恐惧。
I am strong, therefore I must be loved. 
我很坚强，所以我必须被爱。
"I am ...""  Tyranny is the wish to have in one way what can only be had in another. "
我是……”暴政是希望以一种方式拥有只能以另一种方式拥有的东西。
We render different duties to different merits; the duty of love to the pleasant; the duty of fear to the strong; the duty of belief to the learned. 
我们根据不同的优点赋予不同的职责；爱令人愉快的义务；敬畏强者的义务；对学者的信仰义务。
 We must render these duties; it is unjust to refuse them, and unjust to ask others. 
我们必须履行这些职责；拒绝他们是不公正的，要求别人也是不公正的。
"And so it is false and tyrannical to say, ""He is not strong, therefore I will not esteem him; he is not able, therefore I will not fear him.""   333  Have you never seen people who, in order to complain of the little fuss you make about them, parade before you the example of great men who esteem them? In answer I reply to them, ""Show me the merit whereby you have charmed these persons, and I also will esteem you.""   334  _The reason of effects._--Lust and force are the source of all our actions; lust causes voluntary actions, force involuntary ones. "
所以说“他不强，所以我不尊重他；他没有能力，所以我不畏惧他”，这是虚假和专横的。 333 你从未见过有人为了抱怨你对他们的小题大做，而在你面前炫耀尊重他们的伟人的榜样吗？作为回答，我回答他们：“让我看看你吸引这些人的优点，我也会尊重你。” 334_效果的原因。_--欲望和力量是我们一切行为的源泉；欲望导致自愿的行为，迫使非自愿的行为。
  335  _The reason of effects._--It is then true to say that all the world is under a delusion; for, although the opinions of the people are sound, they are not so as conceived by them, since they think the truth to be where it is not. 
 335_效果的原因。_--可以说，整个世界都处于迷惑之中；因为，尽管人们的意见是正确的，但他们的观点并不像他们想象的那样，因为他们认为真理就在不正确的地方。
Truth is indeed in their opinions, but not at the point where they imagine it. 
真理确实存在于他们的观点中，但不是他们想象的那样。
[Thus] it is true that we must honour noblemen, but not because noble birth is real superiority, etc. 
 [因此]我们确实必须尊敬贵族，但并不是因为贵族出身就是真正的优越性，等等。
  336  _The reason of effects._--We must keep our thought secret, and judge everything by it, while talking like the people. 
336_影响的原因。_--我们必须保守我们的思想秘密，并据此判断一切，同时像人们一样说话。
  337  _The reason of effects._--Degrees. 
 337_影响的原因。_--度。
The people honour persons of high birth. 
人们尊敬出身高贵的人。
The semi-learned despise them, saying that birth is not a personal, but a chance superiority. 
半学问的人鄙视他们，说出生不是个人的优势，而是偶然的优势。
The learned honour them, not for popular reasons, but for secret reasons. 
学者们尊敬他们，不是出于大众的原因，而是出于秘密的原因。
Devout persons, who have more zeal than knowledge, despise them, in spite of that consideration which makes them honoured by the learned, because they judge them by a new light which piety gives them. 
虔诚的人，尽管他们的热心比知识更多，却鄙视他们，尽管他们受到有学问的人的尊重，因为他们用虔诚赋予他们的新的光芒来评判他们。
But perfect Christians honour them by another and higher light. 
但完美的基督徒却以另一种更高的光来荣耀他们。
So arise a succession of opinions for and against, according to the light one has. 
因此，根据一个人所拥有的亮光，会出现一系列支持和反对的意见。
  338  True Christians nevertheless comply with folly, not because they respect folly, but the command of God, who for the punishment of men has made them subject to these follies. 
 338然而，真正的基督徒遵守愚蠢，不是因为他们尊重愚蠢，而是因为上帝的命令，上帝为了惩罚人类而使他们屈服于这些愚蠢。
_Omnis creatura subjecta est vanitati.[125] Liberabitur._[126] Thus Saint Thomas[127] explains the passage in Saint James on giving place to the rich, that if they do it not in the sight of God, they depart from the command of religion. 
_Omnis creatura subjecta est vanitati。[125] Liberabitur._[126] 因此，圣托马斯[127]解释了圣詹姆斯中关于让富人占有一席之地的段落，如果他们不在上帝的眼中这样做，他们就背离了宗教的命令。
    SECTION VI  THE PHILOSOPHERS   339  I can well conceive a man without hands, feet, head (for it is only experience which teaches us that the head is more necessary than feet). 
第六节哲学家339 我完全可以想象一个没有手、脚、头的人（因为只有经验告诉我们头比脚更重要）。
But I cannot conceive man without thought; he would be a stone or a brute. 
但我无法想象没有思想的人；他会成为一块石头或一头野兽。
  340  The arithmetical machine produces effects which approach nearer to thought than all the actions of animals. 
 340 算术机器产生的效果比动物的所有行为更接近思想。
But it does nothing which would enable us to attribute will to it, as to the animals. 
但它并没有使我们能够将意志归因于它，就像赋予动物一样。
  341  The account of the pike and frog of Liancourt.[128] They do it always, and never otherwise, nor any other thing showing mind. 
 341 利安库尔的梭子鱼和青蛙的记述。[128]他们总是这样做，从不做其他事，也不做其他任何表明心意的事情。
"  342  If an animal did by mind what it does by instinct, and if it spoke by mind what it speaks by instinct, in hunting, and in warning its mates that the prey is found or lost; it would indeed also speak in regard to those things which affect it closer, as example, ""Gnaw me this cord which is wounding me, and which I cannot reach.""   343  The beak of the parrot, which it wipes, although it is clean. "
342 如果动物在狩猎时，以及在警告其配偶猎物被发现或丢失时，按本能行事，按心灵行事，按本能说话，按心灵说话；它确实也会谈到那些对其影响更近的事情，例如，“咬我这根伤害我的绳子，但我够不到。” 343 鹦鹉的喙，它擦拭，尽管它是干净的。
  344  Instinct and reason, marks of two natures. 
 344 本能和理性，两种本性的标志。
  345  Reason commands us far more imperiously than a master; for in disobeying the one we are unfortunate, and in disobeying the other we are fools. 
 345、理性对我们的命令远比老师更专横；因为违背一个我们就是不幸的，违背另一个我们就是傻瓜。
  346  Thought constitutes the greatness of man. 
 346 思想构成了人的伟大。
  347  Man is but a reed, the most feeble thing in nature; but he is a thinking reed. 
 347 人不过是一根芦苇，是自然界中最脆弱的东西；但他是一根会思考的芦苇。
The entire universe need not arm itself to crush him. 
整个宇宙不需要武装自己来压垮他。
A vapour, a drop of water suffices to kill him. 
一团水蒸气、一滴水就足以杀死他。
But, if the universe were to crush him, man would still be more noble than that which killed him, because he knows that he dies and the advantage which the universe has over him; the universe knows nothing of this. 
但是，如果宇宙要压垮他，人仍然会比杀死他的宇宙更高尚，因为他知道他会死，也知道宇宙对他有优势；他知道自己会死，也知道宇宙对他的优势。宇宙对此一无所知。
 All our dignity consists, then, in thought. 
那么，我们所有的尊严都在于思想。
By it we must elevate ourselves, and not by space and time which we cannot fill. 
我们必须通过它来提升自己，而不是通过我们无法填补的空间和时间。
Let us endeavour, then, to think well; this is the principle of morality. 
那么，让我们努力好好思考吧；这是道德的原则。
  348  _A thinking reed._--It is not from space that I must seek my dignity, but from the government of my thought. 
 348_一根会思考的芦苇。_--我必须不是从空间中寻求我的尊严，而是从我的思想的统治中寻求。
I shall have no more if I possess worlds. 
如果我拥有世界，我将不再拥有。
By space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an atom; by thought I comprehend the world. 
宇宙通过空间像原子一样包围并吞噬我；通过思想我了解世界。
  349  _Immateriality of the soul._--Philosophers[129] who have mastered their passions. 
 349_灵魂的非物质性。_--掌握了自己激情的哲学家[129]。
What matter could do that?   350  _The Stoics._--They conclude that what has been done once can be done always, and that since the desire of glory imparts some power to those whom it possesses, others can do likewise. 
有什么事情可以做到这一点？ 350 斯多葛派——他们的结论是，做过一次的事情就可以永远做，而且既然对荣耀的渴望赋予了它所拥有的人一些权力，那么其他人也可以这样做。
There are feverish movements which health cannot imitate. 
有些发烧的动作是健康无法模仿的。
 Epictetus[130] concludes that since there are consistent Christians, every man can easily be so. 
爱比克泰德[130]的结论是，既然有始终如一的基督徒，那么每个人都可以很容易地成为基督徒。
  351  Those great spiritual efforts, which the soul sometimes assays, are things on which it does not lay hold.[131] It only leaps to them, not as upon a throne, for ever, but merely for an instant. 
 351 灵魂有时会检验的那些伟大的精神努力，是灵魂无法抓住的事情。 [131]它只是永远地跳向他们，而不是像在王座上一样，而只是一瞬间。
  352  The strength of a man's virtue must not be measured by his efforts, but by his ordinary life. 
 352 一个人的德行的强弱，不能用他的努力来衡量，而要用他平凡的生活来衡量。
  353  I do not admire the excess of a virtue as of valour, except I see at the same time the excess of the opposite virtue, as in Epaminondas,[132] who had the greatest valour and the greatest kindness. 
 353我并不钦佩一种美德的过度，就像勇气一样，但我同时看到相反的美德的过度，就像伊巴密浓达[132]一样，他拥有最伟大的勇气和最大的仁慈。
For otherwise it is not to rise, it is to fall. 
否则它就不是上升，而是下降。
We do not display greatness by going to one extreme, but in touching both at once, and filling all the intervening space. 
我们并不是通过走向一个极端来展现伟大，而是通过同时触及两个极端并填补所有中间空间来展现伟大。
But perhaps this is only a sudden movement of the soul from one to the other extreme, and in fact it is ever at one point only, as in the case of a firebrand. 
但也许这只是灵魂从一个极端突然转向另一个极端，而且事实上它只发生在某一时刻，就像火把的情况一样。
Be it so, but at least this indicates agility if not expanse of soul. 
无论如何，但这至少表明了敏捷性（如果不是灵魂的广阔）。
  354  Man's nature is not always to advance; it has its advances and retreats. 
 354 人的本性并不总是前进；它有它的进步和退却。
 Fever has its cold and hot fits; and the cold proves as well as the hot the greatness of the fire of fever. 
发烧有冷热之分。寒冷和炎热一样，都证明了发烧之火的伟大。
 The discoveries of men from age to age turn out the same. 
各个时代的人们的发现都是一样的。
The kindness and the malice of the world in general are the same. 
世间的善与恶，大体上都是一样的。
_Plerumque gratæ principibus vices._[133]   355  Continuous eloquence wearies. 
 _Plerumque gratæ principibus Vices._[133] 355 连续的口才会让人疲倦。
 Princes and kings sometimes play. 
王子和国王有时会玩耍。
They are not always on their thrones.

Continuity in everything is unpleasant. 
一切事物的连续性是令人不愉快的。
Cold is agreeable, that we may get warm.

自然通过进步而行动，_itus et reditus_。
It goes and returns, then advances further, then twice as much backwards, then more forward than ever, etc. 
它前进又返回，然后进一步前进，然后向后退两倍，然后比以往更前进，等等。
 The tide of the sea behaves in the same manner; and so apparently does the sun in its course. 
大海的潮汐也是如此。太阳在其运行过程中显然也是如此。
  356  The nourishment of the body is little by little. 
第356章 身体的滋养是一点一点的。
Fullness of nourishment and smallness of substance. 
营养丰富而物质细小。
  357  When we would pursue virtues to their extremes on either side, vices present themselves, which insinuate themselves insensibly there, in their insensible journey towards the infinitely little: and vices present themselves in a crowd towards the infinitely great, so that we lose ourselves in them, and no longer see virtues. 
 357 当我们向两边追求美德到极致时，罪恶就会出现，它们在无意识的旅程中潜移默化地走向无限渺小：而罪恶则在人群中出现，走向无限伟大，以致我们迷失在其中。他们，不再看到美德。
We find fault with perfection itself. 
我们对完美本身挑剔。
  358  Man is neither angel nor brute, and the unfortunate thing is that he who would act the angel acts the brute.[134]   359  We do not sustain ourselves in virtue by our own strength, but by the balancing of two opposed vices, just as we remain upright amidst two contrary gales. 
358 人既不是天使，也不是畜生，不幸的是，想要扮演天使的人，却做了畜生。[134] 359 我们不是靠自己的力量来维持自己的德行，而是靠两种相对的罪恶的平衡来维持自己，就像我们在两种相反的狂风中保持直立一样。
Remove one of the vices, and we fall into the other. 
除去其中一种恶习，我们就会陷入另一种恶习。
  360  What the Stoics propose is so difficult and foolish!  The Stoics lay down that all those who are not at the high degree of wisdom are equally foolish and vicious, as those who are two inches under water. 
 360 斯多葛学派的主张是如此困难和愚蠢！斯多葛派认为，所有没有高度智慧的人都同样愚蠢和邪恶，就像那些在水下两英寸的人一样。
  361  _The sovereign good. 
 361 _主权善。
Dispute about the sovereign good._--_Ut sis contentus temetipso et ex te nascentibus bonis._[135] There is a contradiction, for in the end they advise suicide. 
关于主权利益的争论。_--_Ut sis contentus temetipso et ex te nascentibus bonis._[135] 这是一个矛盾，因为最后他们建议自杀。
Oh! What a happy life, from which we are to free ourselves as from the plague!   362  _Ex senatus-consultis et plebiscitis_ ...

588.[136]  _Nihil tam absurde dici potest quod non dicatur ab aliquo philosophorum._ Divin.[137]  _Quibusdam destinatis sententiis consecrati quæ non probant coguntur defendere._ Cic.[138]  _Ut omnium rerum sic litterarum quoque intemperantia laboramus._ Senec.[139]  _Id maxime quemque decet, quod est cujusque suum maxime._[140]  _Hos natura modos primum dedit._[141] Georg. 
588.【136】 _没有什么可以说得如此荒谬，以至于一些哲学家没有说过。_神圣的。[137] _奉献于某些注定的观点，但他们无法证明这些观点，他们被迫捍卫。_ Cic。[138] _与所有事物一样，我们也遭受着文学的不节制之苦。_Senec.[139] _最适合每个人的，也就是每个人最适合自己的。_[140] _大自然首先给出了这些方法。_[141] 乔治。

第364章 _因为很少有人对自己足够恐惧。_[144]_如此多的神在一个头上喧闹。_[145]_没有什么比抢占知识的断言更可耻的了。_Cic。[146] _像这些人一样，承认我不知道我不知道的事情，我也不感到羞耻。_[147]_他们不会更好地开始。_[148]365_思想。_--人的所有尊严都在于思想。
Thought is therefore by its nature a wonderful and incomparable thing. 
因此，思想就其本质而言是一种奇妙且无与伦比的东西。
It must have strange defects to be contemptible. 
它一定有奇怪的缺陷才令人鄙视。
But it has such, so that nothing is more ridiculous. 
但它就是这样，所以没有什么比这更荒谬的了。
How great it is in its nature! How vile it is in its defects!  But what is this thought? How foolish it is!   366  The mind of this sovereign judge of the world is not so independent that it is not liable to be disturbed by the first din about it. 
它的本质是多么伟大！它的缺陷是多么卑鄙啊！但这是什么想法呢？这是多么愚蠢啊！ 366 这个世界至高无上的法官的心智并不那么独立，以至于不会被最初的喧嚣所扰乱。
The noise of a cannon is not necessary to hinder its thoughts; it needs only the creaking of a weathercock or a pulley. 
炮声不一定能阻碍它的思考；它只需要风向标或滑轮的吱吱声。
Do not wonder if at present it does not reason well; a fly is buzzing in its ears; that is enough to render it incapable of good judgment. 
不要怀疑目前它是否推理得不好；一只苍蝇在它耳边嗡嗡作响；这足以使其无法做出良好的判断。
If you wish it to be able to reach the truth, chase away that animal which holds its reason in check and disturbs that powerful intellect which rules towns and kingdoms. 
如果你希望它能够达到真理，就赶走那些抑制其理性并扰乱统治城镇和王国的强大智力的动物。
Here is a comical god! _O ridicolosissimo eroe!_   367  The power of flies; they win battles,[149] hinder our soul from acting, eat our body. 
这是一个滑稽的神！第367章 苍蝇的力量；他们赢得战斗，[149]阻碍我们的灵魂行动，吃掉我们的身体。
  368  When it is said that heat is only the motions of certain molecules, and light the _conatus recedendi_ which we feel,[150] it astonishes us. 
368 当有人说热只是某些分子的运动，并照亮我们感受到的_conatus recedendi_时，[150] 它让我们感到惊讶。
What! Is pleasure only the ballet of our spirits? We have conceived so different an idea of it! And these sensations seem so removed from those others which we say are the same as those with which we compare them! The sensation from the fire, that warmth which affects us in a manner wholly different from touch, the reception of sound and light, all this appears to us mysterious, and yet it is material like the blow of a stone. 
什么！快乐只是我们精神的芭蕾吗？我们对此有如此不同的想法！这些感觉似乎与我们所说的与我们比较的那些感觉相同的其他感觉相去甚远！火的感觉、以完全不同于触觉的方式影响我们的温暖、声音和光的接收，所有这一切对我们来说都是神秘的，但它却像石头的撞击一样是物质的。
It is true that the smallness of the spirits which enter into the pores touches other nerves, but there are always some nerves touched. 
诚然，进入毛孔的细小灵气，会触动其他的神经，但总有一些神经被触动。
  369  Memory is necessary for all the operations of reason. 
 369 记忆对于理性的所有运作都是必要的。
  370  [Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them; no art can keep or acquire them. 
 370【机会产生思想，机会消除思想；任何艺术都无法保留或获得它们。
 A thought has escaped me. 
我突然想到了这一点。
I wanted to write it down. 
我想把它写下来。
I write instead, that it has escaped me.]   371  [When I was small, I hugged my book; and because it sometimes happened to me to ... 
相反，我写道，它已经逃脱了我的视线。] 371 [当我还小的时候，我拥抱我的书；因为有时我会遇到...
in believing I hugged it, I doubted....]   372  In writing down my thought, it sometimes escapes me; but this makes me remember my weakness, that I constantly forget. 
当我相信我拥抱了它时，我怀疑了……] 372 在写下我的想法时，有时我会忘记它；但这让我想起了我经常忘记的弱点。
This is as instructive to me as my forgotten thought; for I strive only to know my nothingness. 
这对我来说就像我被遗忘的想法一样具有启发性。因为我努力只是为了知道我的虚无。
  373  _Scepticism._--I shall here write my thoughts without order, and not perhaps in unintentional confusion; that is true order, which will always indicate my object by its very disorder. 
 373_怀疑主义._--我将在这里无序地写下我的想法，也许不是无意识的混乱；这是真正的秩序，它总是通过它的无序来表明我的对象。
I should do too much honour to my subject, if I treated it with order, since I want to show that it is incapable of it. 
如果我以秩序对待我的主题，我就应该对它给予太多的尊重，因为我想表明它没有能力做到这一点。
  374  What astonishes me most is to see that all the world is not astonished at its own weakness. 
 374 最让我惊讶的是，全世界都没有对自己的弱点感到惊讶。
Men act seriously, and each follows his own mode of life, not because it is in fact good to follow since it is the custom, but as if each man knew certainly where reason and justice are. 
人们行事严肃，每个人都遵循自己的生活方式，并不是因为遵循这种生活方式实际上是好的，因为这是习俗，而是好像每个人都清楚地知道理性和正义在哪里。
They find themselves continually deceived, and by a comical humility think it is their own fault, and not that of the art which they claim always to possess. 
他们发现自己不断被欺骗，并出于滑稽的谦逊认为这是他们自己的错，而不是他们声称始终拥有的艺术的错。
But it is well there are so many such people in the world, who are not sceptics for the glory of scepticism, in order to show that man is quite capable of the most extravagant opinions, since he is capable of believing that he is not in a state of natural and inevitable weakness, but, on the contrary, of natural wisdom. 
但世界上有这么多这样的人，他们并不是为了怀疑主义的荣耀而怀疑，以表明人完全有能力提出最夸张的观点，因为他有能力相信自己不存在于其中。一种自然的、不可避免的软弱状态，但相反，它是一种自然的智慧。
Nothing fortifies scepticism more than that there are some who are not sceptics; if all were so, they would be wrong. 
没有什么比有些人不是怀疑论者更能强化怀疑论的了。如果所有人都是这样的话，他们就错了。
  375  [I have passed a great part of my life believing that there was justice, and in this I was not mistaken; for there is justice according as God has willed to reveal it to us. 
 375 [我一生中很大一部分时间都相信正义存在，这一点我没有错；因为正如上帝所愿意向我们启示的那样，正义是存在的。
But I did not take it so, and this is where I made a mistake; for I believed that our justice was essentially just, and that I had that whereby to know and judge of it. 
但我不这么认为，这就是我犯了错误的地方；因为我相信我们的正义本质上是公正的，并且我有能力了解和判断它。
But I have so often found my right judgment at fault, that at last I have come to distrust myself, and then others. 
但我经常发现自己的正确判断出现了错误，最终我开始不信任自己，进而不信任别人。
I have seen changes in all nations and men, and thus after many changes of judgment regarding true justice, I have recognised that our nature was but in continual change, and I have not changed since; and if I changed, I would confirm my opinion. 
我看到了所有国家和人类的变化，因此，在对真正正义的判断发生了多次变化之后，我认识到我们的本性只是在不断变化，从那以后我就没有改变过；如果我改变了，我会证实我的观点。
 The sceptic Arcesilaus,[151] who became a dogmatist.]   376  This sect derives more strength from its enemies than from its friends; for the weakness of man is far more evident in those who know it not than in those who know it. 
怀疑论者阿尔塞西劳斯，[151] 成为教条主义者。] 376 这个教派从敌人那里获得的力量多于从朋友那里获得的力量；因为人的弱点在那些不知道这一点的人身上比在那些知道这一点的人身上更加明显。
  377  Discourses on humility are a source of pride in the vain, and of humility in the humble. 
 377 关于谦卑的话语是虚荣者骄傲的源泉，也是谦卑者谦卑的源泉。
So those on scepticism cause believers to affirm. 
所以那些持怀疑态度的人会引起信徒的肯定。
Few men speak humbly of humility, chastely of chastity, few doubtingly of scepticism. 
很少有人谦卑地谈论谦卑，贞洁地谈论贞洁，很少有人怀疑地谈论怀疑。
We are only falsehood, duplicity, contradiction; we both conceal and disguise ourselves from ourselves. 
我们只是谎言、口是心非、矛盾；我们都隐藏和伪装自己。
  378  _Scepticism._--Excess, like defect of intellect, is accused of madness. 
 378_怀疑主义._--过度，就像智力缺陷一样，被指责为疯狂。
Nothing is good but mediocrity. 
除了平庸之外，没有什么是好的。
The majority has settled that, and finds fault with him who escapes it at whichever end. 
大多数人已经解决了这个问题，并且对无论哪一方逃脱的人都提出了批评。
I will not oppose it. 
我不会反对。
I quite consent to put myself there, and refuse to be at the lower end, not because it is low, but because it is an end; for I would likewise refuse to be placed at the top. 
我非常同意把自己置于那儿，拒绝处于低端，不是因为它低，而是因为它是终点；因为我同样拒绝被置于顶端。
To leave the mean is to abandon humanity. 
离开中庸，就是抛弃人性。
The greatness of the human soul consists in knowing how to preserve the mean. 
人类灵魂的伟大在于懂得如何保持中庸。
So far from greatness consisting in leaving it, it consists in not leaving it. 
伟大远非在于离开它，而是在于不离开它。
  379  It is not good to have too much liberty. 
 379 太自由了不好。
It is not good to have all one wants. 
拥有想要的一切并不好。
  380  All good maxims are in the world. 
 380、天下有善言。
We only need to apply them. 
我们只需要应用它们。
For instance, we do not doubt that we ought to risk our lives in defence of the public good; but for religion, no. 
例如，我们毫不怀疑我们应该冒着生命危险来捍卫公共利益；但对于宗教来说，则不然。
 It is true there must be inequality among men; but if this be conceded, the door is opened not only to the highest power, but to the highest tyranny. 
确实，人与人之间必然存在着不平等。但如果这一点被承认，那么大门不仅向最高权力敞开，而且向最高暴政敞开。
 We must relax our minds a little; but this opens the door to the greatest debauchery. 
我们必须放松一点心情；但这为最大的放荡打开了大门。
Let us mark the limits. 
让我们标记界限。
There are no limits in things. 
事情没有限制。
Laws would put them there, and the mind cannot suffer it. 
法律会把它们放在那里，而心灵却无法忍受它。
  381  When we are too young, we do not judge well; so, also, when we are too old. 
 381 当我们太年轻的时候，我们的判断力不好；当我们太老的时候也是如此。
If we do not think enough, or if we think too much on any matter, we get obstinate and infatuated about it. 
如果我们想得不够，或者对任何事情想得太多，我们就会变得固执、迷恋。
If one considers one's work immediately after having done it, one is entirely prepossessed in its favour; by delaying too long, one can no longer enter into the spirit of it. 
如果一个人在完成一件事后立即考虑自己的工作，那么他就会完全赞成它。拖延太久，就无法再进入其中的精神。
So with pictures seen from too far or too near; there is but one exact point which is the true place wherefrom to look at them: the rest are too near, too far, too high, or too low. 
从太远或太近看的照片也是如此；只有一个确切的点是观察它们的真正位置：其余的点太近、太远、太高或太低。
Perspective determines that point in the art of painting. 
透视决定了绘画艺术的这一点。
But who shall determine it in truth and morality?   382  When all is equally agitated, nothing appears to be agitated, as in a ship. 
但谁能以真理和道德来决定它呢？ 382 当一切都同样激动时，似乎没有什么东西像在船上那样激动。
When all tend to debauchery, none appears to do so. 
当所有人都倾向于放荡时，似乎没有人这样做。
He who stops draws attention to the excess of others, like a fixed point. 
停下来的人会像一个固定点一样将注意力吸引到其他人的过度行为上。
  383  The licentious tell men of orderly lives that they stray from nature's path, while they themselves follow it; as people in a ship think those move who are on the shore. 
 383 放荡者告诉生活秩序井然的人们，他们偏离了自然的道路，而他们自己却追随它；就像船上的人认为岸上的人会移动一样。
On all sides the language is similar. 
各个方面的语言都是相似的。
We must have a fixed point in order to judge. 
我们必须有一个固定的点才能进行判断。
The harbour decides for those who are in a ship; but where shall we find a harbour in morality?   384  Contradiction is a bad sign of truth; several things which are certain are contradicted; several things which are false pass without contradiction. 
港口决定船上的人；但我们到哪里才能找到道德的港湾呢？ 384 矛盾是真理的坏标志；一些确定的事情是矛盾的；有几件事是错误的，并没有矛盾。
Contradiction is not a sign of falsity, nor the want of contradiction a sign of truth. 
矛盾并不是虚假的标志，没有矛盾也不是真理的标志。
  385  _Scepticism._--Each thing here is partly true and partly false.

Essential truth is not so; it is altogether pure and altogether true. 
基本真理并非如此；它是完全纯粹、完全真实的。
This mixture dishonours and annihilates it. 
这种混合物羞辱并消灭了它。
Nothing is purely true, and thus nothing is true, meaning by that pure truth.

You will say it is true that homicide is wrong. 
你会说杀人确实是错误的。

  386  If we dreamt the same thing every night, it would affect us as much as the objects we see every day. 
 386 如果我们每晚都梦到同样的事情，它对我们的影响就和我们每天看到的物体一样大。
And if an artisan were sure to dream every night for twelve hours' duration that he was a king, I believe he would be almost as happy as a king, who should dream every night for twelve hours on end that he was an artisan. 
如果一个工匠确实每晚连续十二个小时梦见自己是一位国王，我相信他几乎会像一位国王一样幸福，因为国王每天晚上连续十二个小时梦见自己是一名工匠。
 If we were to dream every night that we were pursued by enemies, and harassed by these painful phantoms, or that we passed every day in different occupations, as in making a voyage, we should suffer almost as much as if it were real, and should fear to sleep, as we fear to wake when we dread in fact to enter on such mishaps. 
如果我们每天晚上都梦见自己被敌人追赶，被这些痛苦的幻影骚扰，或者每天都在从事不同的职业，比如在航行中，那么我们所遭受的痛苦几乎就和真实的一样，并且我们应该害怕睡觉，就像我们害怕醒来一样，因为我们实际上害怕陷入这样的不幸。
And, indeed, it would cause pretty nearly the same discomforts as the reality. 
事实上，它会引起与现实几乎相同的不适。
" But since dreams are all different, and each single one is diversified, what is seen in them affects us much less than what we see when awake, because of its continuity, which is not, however, so continuous and level as not to change too; but it changes less abruptly, except rarely, as when we travel, and then we say, ""It seems to me I am dreaming."" For life is a dream a little less inconstant. "
但是，由于梦都是不同的，而且每一个梦都是多样化的，所以梦中看到的东西对我们的影响比我们清醒时看到的要小得多，因为它具有连续性，然而，这种连续性和水平并不是那么连续和水平，以至于不会发生变化。 ;但它的变化不那么突然，除非很少见，比如当我们旅行时，然后我们说，“在我看来，我好像在做梦。”因为生活是一场不那么反复无常的梦想。
  387  [It may be that there are true demonstrations; but this is not certain. 
 387【也许有真实的示威；但这并不确定。
"Thus, this proves nothing else but that it is not certain that all is uncertain, to the glory of scepticism.]   388  _Good sense._--They are compelled to say, ""You are not acting in good faith; we are not asleep,"" etc. "
因此，这只能证明一切都不确定，这是怀疑论的荣耀。] 388_好感。_--他们被迫说：“你没有真诚地行事；我们没有睡着。” ，“ ETC。
How I love to see this proud reason humiliated and suppliant! For this is not the language of a man whose right is disputed, and who defends it with the power of armed hands. 
我多么喜欢看到这个骄傲的理性受到羞辱和恳求！因为这不是一个权利受到争议并用武装力量捍卫权利的人的语言。
He is not foolish enough to declare that men are not acting in good faith, but he punishes this bad faith with force. 
他还没有愚蠢到宣称人们没有善意行事，但他用武力惩罚这种恶意。
  389  Ecclesiastes[152] shows that man without God is in total ignorance and inevitable misery. 
 389 传道书[152]表明，没有上帝的人是完全无知的，并且不可避免地遭受痛苦。

因为有愿望却没有权力是可悲的。
Now he would be happy and assured of some truth, and yet he can neither know, nor desire not to know. 
现在他会很高兴并确信某些真相，但他既不能知道，也不想不知道。
He cannot even doubt. 
他甚至无法怀疑。
"  390  My God! How foolish this talk is! ""Would God have made the world to damn it? Would He ask so much from persons so weak?"" etc. "

Scepticism is the cure for this evil, and will take down this vanity. 
怀疑主义是治愈这种罪恶的良药，并将消除这种虚荣心。

 _Conversation._--Scepticism helps religion.

 392 _反对怀疑._--[...
It is, then, a strange fact that we cannot define these things without obscuring them, while we speak of them with all assurance.] We assume that all conceive of them in the same way; but we assume it quite gratuitously, for we have no proof of it. 
因此，一个奇怪的事实是，当我们满怀信心地谈论这些事物时，我们却无法在不模糊它们的情况下定义它们。]但我们的假设是无缘无故的，因为我们没有证据证明这一点。
I see, in truth, that the same words are applied on the same occasions, and that every time two men see a body change its place, they both express their view of this same fact by the same word, both saying that it has moved; and from this conformity of application we derive a strong conviction of a conformity of ideas. 
事实上，我看到，同样的词被用在同样的场合，每次两个人看到一具尸体改变了位置，他们都用同一个词表达了对同一事实的看法，都说它已经移动了。 ;从这种应用的一致性中，我们得出了思想一致性的坚定信念。
But this is not absolutely or finally convincing, though there is enough to support a bet on the affirmative, since we know that we often draw the same conclusions from different premisses. 
但这并不绝对或最终令人信服，尽管有足够的证据支持肯定的赌注，因为我们知道我们经常从不同的前提得出相同的结论。
 This is enough, at least, to obscure the matter; not that it completely extinguishes the natural light which assures us of these things. 
这至少足以掩盖事情的真相。并不是说它完全熄灭了向我们保证这些事情的自然光。
The academicians[153] would have won. 
院士[153]会赢。
But this dulls it, and troubles the dogmatists to the glory of the sceptical crowd, which consists in this doubtful ambiguity, and in a certain doubtful dimness from which our doubts cannot take away all the clearness, nor our own natural lights chase away all the darkness. 
但这使它变得迟钝，并使教条主义者为怀疑论者的荣耀而困扰，这种荣耀存在于这种令人怀疑的模糊性和某种令人怀疑的模糊性中，我们的怀疑不能从其中夺走所有的清晰度，我们自己的自然光也不能赶走所有的模糊性。黑暗。
  393  It is a singular thing to consider that there are people in the world who, having renounced all the laws of God and nature, have made laws for themselves which they strictly obey, as, for instance, the soldiers of Mahomet, robbers, heretics, etc. 
 393 世界上有些人放弃了上帝和自然的所有法则，为自己制定了严格遵守的法则，例如穆罕默德的士兵、强盗、异教徒，这是一件奇怪的事情， ETC。
It is the same with logicians. 
逻辑学家也是如此。
It seems that their licence must be without any limits or barriers, since they have broken through so many that are so just and sacred. 
看来他们的执照一定是没有任何限制或障碍的，因为他们已经突破了如此多的正义和神圣的领域。
  394  All the principles of sceptics, stoics, atheists, etc., are true. 
 394 怀疑论者、斯多葛派、无神论者等的所有原则都是正确的。
But their conclusions are false, because the opposite principles are also true. 
但他们的结论是错误的，因为相反的原理也是正确的。
  395  _Instinct, reason._--We have an incapacity of proof, insurmountable by all dogmatism. 
 395_本能，理性。_--我们没有能力证明，所有教条主义都无法克服这一点。

It is then being miserable to know oneself to be miserable; but it is also being great to know that one is miserable. 
知道自己是痛苦的，那就是痛苦；但知道一个人很痛苦也是件好事。

 _Ego vir videns._[154] 400 _人的伟大。_--我们对人的灵魂有如此伟大的认识，以至于我们不能忍受被任何灵魂轻视或不尊重；人的一切幸福都在于这种尊重。

并不是说他们在比赛中没有竞争，但这并不重要。因为，当在马厩里时，最重、最畸形的人不会将自己的燕麦交给另一个人，就像人们希望别人对他们做的那样。
Their virtue is satisfied with itself.

  402  The greatness of man even in his lust, to have known how to extract from it a wonderful code, and to have drawn from it a picture of benevolence. 
 402 人的伟大之处在于他的欲望，知道如何从中提取出美妙的密码，并从中绘制出仁慈的图画。
  403  _Greatness._--The reasons of effects indicate the greatness of man, in having extracted so fair an order from lust. 
 403_伟大._--效果的原因表明了人类的伟大，从欲望中提取了如此公平的秩序。
  404  The greatest baseness of man is the pursuit of glory. 
 404 人最大的卑鄙就是追求荣耀。
But it is also the greatest mark of his excellence; for whatever possessions he may have on earth, whatever health and essential comfort, he is not satisfied if he has not the esteem of men. 
但这也是他卓越的最大标志。因为，无论他在世上拥有什么财产，无论健康和基本的舒适如何，如果他得不到人们的尊重，他就不会满足。
He values human reason so highly that, whatever advantages he may have on earth, he is not content if he is not also ranked highly in the judgment of man. 
他如此高度重视人类的理性，以至于无论他在地球上拥有什么优势，如果他在人类的判断中没有得到很高的评价，他就不会满足。
This is the finest position in the world. 
这是世界上最好的位置。
Nothing can turn him from that desire, which is the most indelible quality of man's heart. 
没有什么可以使他放弃这种渴望，这是人心中最不可磨灭的品质。
 And those who most despise men, and put them on a level with the brutes, yet wish to be admired and believed by men, and contradict themselves by their own feelings; their nature, which is stronger than all, convincing them of the greatness of man more forcibly than reason convinces them of their baseness. 
而那些最鄙视人类，将人类与畜生同等对待的人，却希望得到人类的钦佩和信任，却用自己的感情来矛盾自己；他们的本性比一切都强大，使他们相信人的伟大，比理性使他们相信自己的卑鄙更有力。
  405  _Contradiction._--Pride counterbalancing all miseries. 
 405 _矛盾._--骄傲抵消了所有的痛苦。
Man either hides his miseries, or, if he disclose them, glories in knowing them. 
人要么隐藏自己的痛苦，要么，如果他揭露了这些痛苦，就会以了解它们为荣。
  406  Pride counterbalances and takes away all miseries. 
 406 骄傲可以平衡并消除所有痛苦。
Here is a strange monster, and a very plain aberration. 
这是一个奇怪的怪物，而且是一个非常明显的异常现象。
He is fallen from his place, and is anxiously seeking it. 
他从自己的位置上跌落下来，正在焦急地寻找它。
This is what all men do. 
这是所有男人都会做的事。
Let us see who will have found it. 
让我们看看谁会找到它。
  407  When malice has reason on its side, it becomes proud, and parades reason in all its splendour. 
 407 当恶意有理性站在一边时，它就会变得骄傲，并炫耀理性的全部辉煌。
When austerity or stern choice has not arrived at the true good, and must needs return to follow nature, it becomes proud by reason of this return. 
当苦行或严选未达到真善，必须回归自然时，它就因这种回归而骄傲。
  408  Evil is easy, and has infinite forms; good is almost unique.[155] But a certain kind of evil is as difficult to find as what we call good; and often on this account such particular evil gets passed off as good. 
 408 恶易而易，其形无穷；好的几乎是独一无二的。[155]但某种恶与我们所谓的善一样难以找到。正是由于这个原因，这种特殊的邪恶常常被冒充为善。
An extraordinary greatness of soul is needed in order to attain to it as well as to good. 
为了实现它以及走向善，需要非凡的伟大灵魂。
  409  _The greatness of man._--The greatness of man is so evident, that it is even proved by his wretchedness. 
 409_人的伟大。_--人的伟大是如此明显，甚至可以通过他的不幸来证明。
For what in animals is nature we call in man wretchedness; by which we recognise that, his nature being now like that of animals, he has fallen from a better nature which once was his. 
因为动物的本性我们称之为人类的不幸；由此我们认识到，他的本性现在就像动物一样，他已经从曾经属于他的更好的本性中堕落了。
 For who is unhappy at not being a king, except a deposed king? Was Paulus Æmilius[156] unhappy at being no longer consul? On the contrary, everybody thought him happy in having been consul, because the office could only be held for a time. 
除了被废黜的国王之外，谁会因为自己没有成为国王而感到不高兴呢？保卢斯·埃米利乌斯[156]对不再担任执政官感到不满吗？相反，每个人都认为他很高兴担任执政官，因为这个职位只能担任一段时间。
But men thought Perseus so unhappy in being no longer king, because the condition of kingship implied his being always king, that they thought it strange that he endured life. 
但人们认为珀尔修斯因不再是国王而感到非常不高兴，因为王权的条件意味着他永远是国王，他们认为他忍受生命很奇怪。
Who is unhappy at having only one mouth? And who is not unhappy at having only one eye? Probably no man ever ventured to mourn at not having three eyes. 
谁因只有一张嘴而感到不高兴？谁不因为只有一只眼睛而感到不高兴呢？也许没有人敢于为没有三只眼睛而哀悼。
But any one is inconsolable at having none. 
但任何人都因为没有得到而感到伤心。
  410  _Perseus, King of Macedon._--Paulus Æmilius reproached Perseus for not killing himself. 
 410_珀尔修斯，马其顿国王。_-保卢斯·埃米利乌斯责备珀尔修斯没有自杀。
  411  Notwithstanding the sight of all our miseries, which press upon us and take us by the throat, we have an instinct which we cannot repress, and which lifts us up. 
 411 尽管我们看到所有的苦难压在我们身上，扼住我们的喉咙，但我们有一种无法压抑的本能，它使我们振奋。
  412  There is internal war in man between reason and the passions. 
 412 人的理性与情感之间存在着内在的战争。
 If he had only reason without passions ... 
如果他只有理性而没有激情……
 If he had only passions without reason ... 
如果他只有激情而没有理由......
 But having both, he cannot be without strife, being unable to be at peace with the one without being at war with the other. 
但两者兼而有之，他就不可能没有冲突，无法与其中一个和平相处而不与另一个发生战争。
Thus he is always divided against, and opposed to himself. 
因此，他总是分裂自己，反对自己。
  413  This internal war of reason against the passions has made a division of those who would have peace into two sects. 
 413 这场理性与激情的内部战争将那些希望和平的人分成了两个派别。
The first would renounce their passions, and become gods; the others would renounce reason, and become brute beasts. 
第一个会放弃他们的激情，成为神；第二个会放弃他们的激情，成为神。其他人就会放弃理性，成为野兽。
(Des Barreaux.)[157] But neither can do so, and reason still remains, to condemn the vileness and injustice of the passions, and to trouble the repose of those who abandon themselves to them; and the passions keep always alive in those who would renounce them. 
 （德·巴罗。）[157] 但两者都不能这样做，理性仍然存在，谴责激情的卑鄙和不公正，并扰乱那些沉迷于激情的人的安宁；那些愿意放弃激情的人的激情始终不减。
  414  Men are so necessarily mad, that not to be mad would amount to another form of madness. 
 414 人必然会发疯，不发疯就等于另一种形式的发疯。
  415  The nature of man may be viewed in two ways: the one according to its end, and then he is great and incomparable; the other according to the multitude, just as we judge of the nature of the horse and the dog, popularly, by seeing its fleetness, _et animum arcendi_; and then man is abject and vile. 
415 人的本质可以从两种角度来看待：一种是根据其目的，那么他是伟大的、无与伦比的；另一种是根据其目的，那么他是伟大的、无可比拟的；另一个根据大众，就像我们判断马和狗的性质一样，通常通过看到它的敏捷性来判断，_et animum arcendi_；那么人就是卑鄙卑鄙的。
These are the two ways which make us judge of him differently, and which occasion such disputes among philosophers. 
这两种方式使我们对他有不同的评价，并引起哲学家之间的争论。
 For one denies the assumption of the other. 
因为一个人否认另一个人的假设。
"One says, ""He is not born for this end, for all his actions are repugnant to it."" The other says, ""He forsakes his end, when he does these base actions.""   416  _For Port-Royal.[158] Greatness and wretchedness._--Wretchedness being deduced from greatness, and greatness from wretchedness, some have inferred man's wretchedness all the more because they have taken his greatness as a proof of it, and others have inferred his greatness with all the more force, because they have inferred it from his very wretchedness. "
有人说：“他不是为了这个目的而生的，因为他的一切行为都与这个目的相抵触。”另一个人说：“当他做出这些卑鄙的行为时，他就放弃了自己的目的。” [158] 第416话伟大与悲惨。_-从伟大推论出悲惨，从悲惨中推断出伟大，有些人更加推断出人的悲惨，因为他们将人的伟大作为证据，而另一些人则更加有力地推断出人的伟大，因为他们从他的不幸中推断出这一点。
All that the one party has been able to say in proof of his greatness has only served as an argument of his wretchedness to the others, because the greater our fall, the more wretched we are, and _vice versa._ The one party is brought back to the other in an endless circle, it being certain that in proportion as men possess light they discover both the greatness and the wretchedness of man. 
一方为证明自己的伟大而所说的一切，都只是向其他一方证明了他的不幸，因为我们的堕落越大，我们就越不幸，反之亦然。无限循环地回到另一个人，可以肯定的是，人拥有光明的程度越高，他们就越能发现人的伟大和不幸。
In a word, man knows that he is wretched. 
总而言之，人知道自己是可怜的。
He is therefore wretched, because he is so; but he is really great because he knows it. 
因此，他是不幸的，因为他就是如此；但他真的很伟大，因为他知道这一点。
  417  This twofold nature of man is so evident that some have thought that we had two souls. 
 417 人的双重本质是如此明显，以至于有些人认为我们有两个灵魂。
A single subject seemed to them incapable of such sudden variations from unmeasured presumption to a dreadful dejection of heart. 
在他们看来，一个人似乎无法从毫无节制的自以为是到内心可怕的沮丧之间发生如此突然的变化。
  418  It is dangerous to make man see too clearly his equality with the brutes without showing him his greatness. 
 418 使人过分清楚地看到他与畜生的平等而不向他展示他的伟大是危险的。
It is also dangerous to make him see his greatness too clearly, apart from his vileness. 
让他太清楚地看到自己的伟大而忽视他的卑鄙也是危险的。
It is still more dangerous to leave him in ignorance of both. 
让他对这两件事都一无所知更加危险。
But it is very advantageous to show him both. 
但将两者都展示给他是非常有利的。
Man must not think that he is on a level either with the brutes or with the angels, nor must he be ignorant of both sides of his nature; but he must know both. 
人不能认为自己与野兽或天使处于同一水平，也不能忽视自己本性的两面；但他必须两者都知道。
  419  I will not allow man to depend upon himself, or upon another, to the end that being without a resting-place and without repose ... 
第419章 我不会让人依靠自己，或者依靠别人，以致无处安息……
  420  If he exalt himself, I humble him; if he humble himself, I exalt him; and I always contradict him, till he understands that he is an incomprehensible monster. 
420 他若高举自己，我就贬低他；如果他自卑，我就高举他；我总是反驳他，直到他明白自己是一个不可理解的怪物。
  421  I blame equally those who choose to praise man, those who choose to blame him, and those who choose to amuse themselves; and I can only approve of those who seek with lamentation. 
 421 我同样责备那些选择赞美人类的人、那些选择责备人类的人以及那些选择自娱自乐的人；我只能赞同那些带着哀叹寻求的人。
  422  It is good to be tired and wearied by the vain search after the true good, that we may stretch out our arms to the Redeemer. 
 422 因徒劳地追求真善而感到疲倦和疲倦是件好事，这样我们就可以向救赎主伸出双臂。
  423  _Contraries. 
 423_相反。
After having shown the vileness and the greatness of man._--Let man now know his value. 
在展示了人的卑鄙和伟大之后。_--现在让人知道他的价值。
Let him love himself, for there is in him a nature capable of good; but let him not for this reason love the vileness which is in him. 
让他爱自己，因为他有善良的本性。但不要让他因此而喜爱他内心的卑鄙。
Let him despise himself, for this capacity is barren; but let him not therefore despise this natural capacity. 
让他鄙视自己吧，因为这种能力是贫瘠的；但让他不要因此而轻视这种自然能力。
Let him hate himself, let him love himself; he has within him the capacity of knowing the truth and of being happy, but he possesses no truth, either constant or satisfactory. 
让他恨自己，让他爱自己；他内心有了解真理和快乐的能力，但他不拥有恒久或令人满意的真理。
 I would then lead man to the desire of finding truth; to be free from passions, and ready to follow it where he may find it, knowing how much his knowledge is obscured by the passions. 
然后我会引导人们寻找真理的愿望；摆脱激情，并准备好在他可能找到的地方追随它，同时知道他的知识有多少被激情所掩盖。
I would indeed that he should hate in himself the lust which determined his will by itself, so that it may not blind him in making his choice, and may not hinder him when he has chosen. 
我确实希望他内心憎恨那由自身决定其意志的情欲，这样它就不会蒙蔽他的选择，也不会在他做出选择时阻碍他。
  424  All these contradictions, which seem most to keep me from the knowledge of religion, have led me most quickly to the true one. 
 424 所有这些矛盾似乎最阻碍我了解宗教知识，但它们却很快引导我找到了真正的宗教知识。
    SECTION VII  MORALITY AND DOCTRINE   425  _Second part.--That man without faith cannot know the true good, nor justice._  All men seek happiness. 
第七节道德与教义 425_第二部分。——没有信仰的人无法了解真正的善，也无法了解正义。_所有人都寻求幸福。
This is without exception. 
这无一例外。
Whatever different means they employ, they all tend to this end.[159] The cause of some going to war, and of others avoiding it, is the same desire in both, attended with different views. 
无论他们采用不同的手段，他们都倾向于这个目的。[159]一些人发动战争，另一些人避免战争，两者的原因是相同的，但有不同的观点。
The will never takes the least step but to this object. 
除了这个目标之外，意志绝不会迈出任何一步。
This is the motive of every action of every man, even of those who hang themselves. 
这是每个人的每一个行为的动机，甚至是那些上吊自杀的人。
 And yet after such a great number of years, no one without faith has reached the point to which all continually look. 
然而，经过这么多年，没有一个没有信仰的人能够达到所有人不断关注的地步。
All complain, princes and subjects, noblemen and commoners, old and young, strong and weak, learned and ignorant, healthy and sick, of all countries, all times, all ages, and all conditions. 
诸侯臣民、贵族百姓、老少强弱、博学愚昧、健康患病、一切国家、一切时代、一切年龄、一切状况，皆有怨言。
 A trial so long, so continuous, and so uniform, should certainly convince us of our inability to reach the good by our own efforts. 
如此长时间、如此持续、如此一致的审判，无疑应该让我们相信，我们无法通过自己的努力达到善果。
But example teaches us little. 
但例子对我们启发甚少。
No resemblance is ever so perfect that there is not some slight difference; and hence we expect that our hope will not be deceived on this occasion as before. 
任何相似之处都不会完美到不存在细微差别。因此，我们希望这次我们的希望不会像以前那样被欺骗。
And thus, while the present never satisfies us, experience dupes us, and from misfortune to misfortune leads us to death, their eternal crown. 
因此，虽然当下永远无法满足我们，但经验却欺骗了我们，一次又一次的不幸将我们引向死亡，这是死亡的永恒王冠。
 What is it then that this desire and this inability proclaim to us, but that there was once in man a true happiness of which there now remain to him only the mark and empty trace, which he in vain tries to fill from all his surroundings, seeking from things absent the help he does not obtain in things present? But these are all inadequate, because the infinite abyss can only be filled by an infinite and immutable object, that is to say, only by God Himself. 
那么，这种欲望和这种无能向我们宣告的是什么，只不过是人类曾经有过一种真正的幸福，而现在，这种幸福对他来说只剩下痕迹和空洞的痕迹，他徒劳地试图从周围的一切中填补它，从不存在的事物中寻求他在存在的事物中无法获得的帮助？但这些都是不够的，因为无限的深渊只能由无限的、不变的物体来填补，也就是说，只能由上帝自己来填补。
 He only is our true good, and since we have forsaken Him, it is a strange thing that there is nothing in nature which has not been serviceable in taking His place; the stars, the heavens, earth, the elements, plants, cabbages, leeks, animals, insects, calves, serpents, fever, pestilence, war, famine, vices, adultery, incest. 
唯有他才是我们真正的良善，既然我们已经离弃了他，奇怪的是，自然界中没有什么东西不能代替他的位置。星星、天空、大地、元素、植物、卷心菜、韭菜、动物、昆虫、牛犊、蛇、发烧、瘟疫、战争、饥荒、恶习、通奸、乱伦。
And since man has lost the true good, everything can appear equally good to him, even his own destruction, though so opposed to God, to reason, and to the whole course of nature. 
既然人已经失去了真正的善，那么一切对他来说都同样美好，甚至包括他自己的毁灭，尽管如此反对上帝、反对理性、反对整个自然进程。
 Some seek good in authority, others in scientific research, others in pleasure. 
有些人寻求权威，有些人寻求科学研究，有些人则寻求享乐。
Others, who are in fact nearer the truth, have considered it necessary that the universal good, which all men desire, should not consist in any of the particular things which can only be possessed by one man, and which, when shared, afflict their possessor more by the want of the part he has not, than they please him by the possession of what he has. 
事实上，更接近事实的其他人则认为，所有人都渴望的普遍利益不应存在于任何只能由一个人拥有的特定事物中，而这些事物在分享时会损害他们的利益。拥有者更多地是因为想要他没有的部分，而不是因为拥有他所拥有的东西而取悦他。
They have learned that the true good should be such as all can possess at once, without diminution and without envy, and which no one can lose against his will. 
他们了解到，真正的善应该是所有人都能同时拥有的善，而不会减少，也不会嫉妒，任何人都不能违背自己的意愿而失去它。
And their reason is that this desire being natural to man, since it is necessarily in all, and that it is impossible not to have it, they infer from it ... 
他们的理由是，这种欲望对人类来说是自然的，因为它必然存在于所有人之中，并且不可能没有它，他们从中推断......
  426  True nature being lost, everything becomes its own nature; as the true good being lost, everything becomes its own true good. 
426 真性失去，一切皆自性；当真正的善失去时，一切都变成了它自己的真正的善。
  427  Man does not know in what rank to place himself. 
 427 人不知道该把自己放在什么位置上。
He has plainly gone astray, and fallen from his true place without being able to find it again. 
他显然已经误入歧途，从他真正的位置跌落而无法再次找到它。
He seeks it anxiously and unsuccessfully everywhere in impenetrable darkness. 
他在无法穿透的黑暗中到处焦急地寻找它，但没有成功。
  428  If it is a sign of weakness to prove God by nature, do not despise Scripture; if it is a sign of strength to have known these contradictions, esteem Scripture. 
 428 如果证明上帝的本性是软弱的表现，请不要轻视圣经；如果知道这些矛盾是力量的标志，那就尊重圣经。
  429  The vileness of man in submitting himself to the brutes, and in even worshipping them. 
 429 人类的卑鄙在于屈服于畜生，甚至崇拜它们。
  430  _For Port Royal. 
 430 _对于皇家港。
The beginning, after having explained the incomprehensibility._--The greatness and the wretchedness of man are so evident that the true religion must necessarily teach us both that there is in man some great source of greatness, and a great source of wretchedness. 
开头，在解释了不可理解的事情之后。_--人的伟大和不幸是如此明显，所以真正的宗教必须教导我们，人身上有一些伟大的根源，也有一个伟大的根源。
It must then give us a reason for these astonishing contradictions. 
那么它必须为我们提供这些令人震惊的矛盾的理由。
 In order to make man happy, it must prove to him that there is a God; that we ought to love Him; that our true happiness is to be in Him, and our sole evil to be separated from Him; it must recognise that we are full of darkness which hinders us from knowing and loving Him; and that thus, as our duties compel us to love God, and our lusts turn us away from Him, we are full of unrighteousness. 
为了使人幸福，就必须向他证明有一位上帝；我们应该爱他；我们真正的幸福就是在他里面，而我们唯一的不幸就是与他分离；它必须认识到我们充满了黑暗，阻碍我们认识和爱他；因此，当我们的责任迫使我们爱上帝，而我们的私欲使我们远离他时，我们就充满了不义。
It must give us an explanation of our opposition to God and to our own good. 
它必须向我们解释我们对上帝和我们自己利益的反对。
It must teach us the remedies for these infirmities, and the means of obtaining these remedies. 
它必须教导我们这些疾病的治疗方法，以及获得这些治疗方法的方法。
Let us therefore examine all the religions of the world, and see if there be any other than the Christian which is sufficient for this purpose. 
因此，让我们考察一下世界上所有的宗教，看看除了基督教之外是否还有其他宗教足以达到这个目的。
 Shall it be that of the philosophers, who put forward as the chief good, the good which is in ourselves? Is this the true good? Have they found the remedy for our ills? Is man's pride cured by placing him on an equality with God? Have those who have made us equal to the brutes, or the Mahommedans who have offered us earthly pleasures as the chief good even in eternity, produced the remedy for our lusts? What religion, then, will teach us to cure pride and lust? What religion will in fact teach us our good, our duties, the weakness which turns us from them, the cause of this weakness, the remedies which can cure it, and the means of obtaining these remedies?  All other religions have not been able to do so. 
难道是那些提出我们自身的善为首要善的哲学家的观点吗？这就是真正的善吗？他们找到治疗我们疾病的方法了吗？人的骄傲是否可以通过与上帝平等来治愈？那些让我们与畜生平等的人，或者那些为我们提供永恒的尘世快乐作为首要利益的伊斯兰教徒，是否已经为我们的欲望找到了补救措施？那么，什么宗教会教我们治愈骄傲和欲望呢？事实上，哪种宗教会教导我们我们的善、我们的义务、使我们远离这些义务的弱点、造成这种弱点的原因、可以治愈它的补救措施以及获得这些补救措施的方法？所有其他宗教都无法做到这一点。
Let us see what the wisdom of God will do. 
让我们看看神的智慧会做什么。
" ""Expect neither truth,"" she says, ""nor consolation from men. "
 “不要期待真相，”她说，“也不要期待来自男人的安慰。
I am she who formed you, and who alone can teach you what you are. 
我是塑造你的她，只有我才能教会你你是谁。
But you are now no longer in the state in which I formed you. 
但你现在已经不再是我塑造你时的状态了。
I created man holy, innocent, perfect. 
我创造了人类，圣洁、纯真、完美。
I filled him with light and intelligence. 
我让他充满了光明和智慧。
I communicated to him my glory and my wonders. 
我向他传达了我的荣耀和奇迹。
The eye of man saw then the majesty of God. 
那时，人的眼睛看到了神的威严。
He was not then in the darkness which blinds him, nor subject to mortality and the woes which afflict him. 
那时他并没有处于使他失明的黑暗之中，也没有遭受死亡和折磨他的痛苦。
But he has not been able to sustain so great glory without falling into pride. 
但他无法在不陷入骄傲的情况下维持如此巨大的荣耀。
He wanted to make himself his own centre, and independent of my help. 
他想让自己成为自己的中心，并且独立于我的帮助。
He withdrew himself from my rule; and, on his making himself equal to me by the desire of finding his happiness in himself, I abandoned him to himself. 
他退出了我的统治；当他渴望在自己身上找到幸福时，我就抛弃了他，让他与我平等。
And setting in revolt the creatures that were subject to him, I made them his enemies; so that man is now become like the brutes, and so estranged from me that there scarce remains to him a dim vision of his Author. 
我使臣服于他的生物反抗，使他们成为他的敌人；因此，人现在变得像野兽一样，与我如此疏远，以至于他对他的创造者几乎没有什么模糊的认识。
So far has all his knowledge been extinguished or disturbed! The senses, independent of reason, and often the masters of reason, have led him into pursuit of pleasure. 
至此他的所有神识都已经被消灭或者扰乱了！独立于理性的感官，往往是理性的主人，引导他追求快乐。
All creatures either torment or tempt him, and domineer over him, either subduing him by their strength, or fascinating him by their charms, a tyranny more awful and more imperious. 
一切生灵要么折磨他，要么引诱他，对他横行霸道，要么以力量征服他，要么以魅力迷惑他，更加可怕，更加专横。
" ""Such is the state in which men now are. "
 “这就是人类现在的处境。
There remains to them some feeble instinct of the happiness of their former state; and they are plunged in the evils of their blindness and their lust, which have become their second nature. 
他们仍然保留着某种微弱的本能，认为自己以前的状态是幸福的。他们陷入盲目和情欲的罪恶之中，这已成为他们的第二天性。
" ""From this principle which I disclose to you, you can recognise the cause of those contradictions which have astonished all men, and have divided them into parties holding so different views. "
 “从我向你透露的这个原则，你可以认识到那些令所有人震惊的矛盾的原因，并将他们分成持有如此不同观点的政党。
"Observe, now, all the feelings of greatness and glory which the experience of so many woes cannot stifle, and see if the cause of them must not be in another nature.""  _For Port-Royal to-morrow (Prosopopœa)._--""It is in vain, O men, that you seek within yourselves the remedy for your ills. "
现在，请观察所有伟大和荣耀的感觉，这些感觉是经历了如此多的苦难而无法抑制的，看看它们的原因是否一定是另一种性质。”_为了明天的皇家港口（Prosopopœa）。_-- “人类啊，你们在自己身上寻找治愈疾病的方法是徒劳的。
All your light can only reach the knowledge that not in yourselves will you find truth or good. 
你所有的光只能到达这样的知识：你无法在自己身上找到真理或良善。
The philosophers have promised you that, and have been unable to do it. 
哲学家们已经向你承诺过这一点，但却无法做到。
They neither know what is your true good, nor what is your true state. 
他们不知道什么是你真正的善，也不知道你的真实状态是什么。
How could they have given remedies for your ills, when they did not even know them? Your chief maladies are pride, which takes you away from God, and lust, which binds you to earth; and they have done nothing else but cherish one or other of these diseases. 
当他们甚至不知道的时候，他们怎么可能为你的疾病提供治疗方法呢？你的主要毛病是骄傲，它让你远离上帝，还有欲望，它把你束缚在尘世之上。他们除了珍惜这些疾病中的一种或另一种之外，什么也没做。
If they gave you God as an end, it was only to administer to your pride; they made you think that you are by nature like Him, and conformed to Him. 
如果他们把上帝当作目的，那也只是为了满足你的骄傲；他们让你认为你生来就像他，并且效法他。
And those who saw the absurdity of this claim put you on another precipice, by making you understand that your nature was like that of the brutes, and led you to seek your good in the lusts which are shared by the animals. 
那些看到这种说法荒谬的人把你推向了另一个悬崖，让你明白你的本性就像野兽一样，并引导你在动物所共有的欲望中寻求你的好处。
This is not the way to cure you of your unrighteousness, which these wise men never knew. 
这不是治愈你的不义的方法，这些智者从来不知道这一点。
"I alone can make you understand who you are....""  Adam, Jesus Christ. "
只有我才能让你明白你是谁……”亚当，耶稣基督。
 If you are united to God, it is by grace, not by nature. 
如果你与神联合，那是出于恩典，而不是本性。
If you are humbled, it is by penitence, not by nature. 
如果你感到谦卑，那是出于悔罪，而不是出于本性。
 Thus this double capacity ... 
因此，这种双倍容量...
 You are not in the state of your creation. 
你并不处于你的创造状态。
 As these two states are open, it is impossible for you not to recognise them. 
由于这两种状态是开放的，你不可能不认识它们。
Follow your own feelings, observe yourselves, and see if you do not find the lively characteristics of these two natures. 
跟随你自己的感觉，观察你自己，看看你是否没有发现这两种本性的活泼特征。
Could so many contradictions be found in a simple subject?  --Incomprehensible.--Not all that is incomprehensible ceases to exist. 
一个简单的话题能找出这么多矛盾吗？ --不可理解。--并非所有不可理解的事物都不再存在。
Infinite number. 
无限数。
An infinite space equal to a finite. 
无限空间等于有限空间。
 --Incredible that God should unite Himself to us.--This consideration is drawn only from the sight of our vileness. 
 ——令人难以置信的是，上帝竟然与我们联合起来。——这种考虑只是因为我们看到了我们的卑鄙。
But if you are quite sincere over it, follow it as far as I have done, and recognise that we are indeed so vile that we are incapable in ourselves of knowing if His mercy cannot make us capable of Him. 
但如果你对此非常真诚，请按照我所做的那样去做，并认识到我们确实如此卑鄙，以至于我们自己无法知道他的怜悯是否不能使我们有能力与他相处。
For I would know how this animal, who knows himself to be so weak, has the right to measure the mercy of God, and set limits to it, suggested by his own fancy. 
因为我想知道，这种知道自己如此软弱的动物如何有权衡量上帝的仁慈，并根据自己的想象对其设定限制。
He has so little knowledge of what God is, that he does not know what he himself is, and, completely disturbed at the sight of his own state, dares to say that God cannot make him capable of communion with Him. 
他对上帝的认识是如此之少，以至于他不知道他自己是什么，并且在看到自己的光景时完全感到不安，竟然敢说上帝不能使他能够与他相交。
 But I would ask him if God demands anything else from him than the knowledge and love of Him, and why, since his nature is capable of love and knowledge, he believes that God cannot make Himself known and loved by him. 
但我想问他，除了对他的认识和爱之外，上帝是否还要求他做任何其他事情？既然他的本性能够爱和知识，为什么他相信上帝不能让他认识自己并被他所爱。
Doubtless he knows at least that he exists, and that he loves something. 
毫无疑问，他至少知道他的存在，并且他热爱某些东西。
Therefore, if he sees anything in the darkness wherein he is, and if he finds some object of his love among the things on earth, why, if God impart to him some ray of His essence, will he not be capable of knowing and of loving Him in the manner in which it shall please Him to communicate Himself to us? There must then be certainly an intolerable presumption in arguments of this sort, although they seem founded on an apparent humility, which is neither sincere nor reasonable, if it does not make us admit that, not knowing of ourselves what we are, we can only learn it from God. 
因此，如果他在他所在的黑暗中看到任何东西，如果他在地球上的事物中找到了他所爱的对象，那么，如果上帝将他的本质之光赐给他，为什么他不能认识和认识呢？以他乐意向我们传达自己的方式来爱他？那么，在这类论证中肯定存在一种令人无法容忍的假设，尽管它们似乎建立在一种明显的谦卑之上，这种谦卑既不真诚也不合理，如果它不能让我们承认，我们不知道自己是什么，我们只能向神学习。
" ""I do not mean that you should submit your belief to me without reason, and I do not aspire to overcome you by tyranny. "
 “我并不是说你应该无缘无故地向我屈服你的信仰，我也不渴望用暴政来征服你。
In fact, I do not claim to give you a reason for everything. 
事实上，我并不声称要给你一切的理由。
And to reconcile these contradictions, I intend to make you see clearly, by convincing proofs, those divine signs in me, which may convince you of what I am, and may gain authority for me by wonders and proofs which you cannot reject; so that you may then believe without ... 
为了调和这些矛盾，我打算通过令人信服的证据，让你们清楚地看到我身上的那些神圣迹象，这些迹象可以让你们相信我是谁，并可以通过你们无法拒绝的奇迹和证据为我赢得权威。这样你就可以相信，无需......
the things which I teach you, since you will find no other ground for rejecting them, except that you cannot know of yourselves if they are true or not. 
我教你们的事情，因为你们找不到其他理由拒绝它们，除非你们自己无法知道它们是否真实。
" ""God has willed to redeem men, and to open salvation to those who seek it. "
 “上帝愿意救赎人类，并向那些寻求救赎的人敞开救赎之门。
But men render themselves so unworthy of it, that it is right that God should refuse to some, because of their obduracy, what He grants to others from a compassion which is not due to them. 
但人却使自己如此不配，以至于上帝因某些人的顽固而拒绝他出于不属于他们的怜悯而赐予他人的东西，这是正确的。
If He had willed to overcome the obstinacy of the most hardened, He could have done so by revealing Himself so manifestly to them that they could not have doubted of the truth of His essence; as it will appear at the last day, with such thunders and such a convulsion of nature, that the dead will rise again, and the blindest will see Him. 
如果他愿意克服最顽固的人的顽固，他就可以通过向他们如此明显地启示自己来做到这一点，使他们不会怀疑他本质的真实性。正如末日将出现的那样，伴随着如此的雷霆和自然的震动，死者将复活，最盲目的人也会看到他。
" ""It is not in this manner that He has willed to appear in His advent of mercy, because, as so many make themselves unworthy of His mercy, He has willed to leave them in the loss of the good which they do not want. "
 “他并不是愿意以这种方式出现他的怜悯，因为，当许多人使自己不值得他的怜悯时，他愿意让他们失去他们不想要的好处。
It was not then right that He should appear in a manner manifestly divine, and completely capable of convincing all men; but it was also not right that He should come in so hidden a manner that He could not be known by those who should sincerely seek Him. 
那么，他应该以一种明显神圣的方式出现，并且完全能够说服所有人，这是不正确的；但他以如此隐蔽的方式降临，以致那些真诚寻求他的人无法认识他，这也是不对的。
He has willed to make Himself quite recognisable by those; and thus, willing to appear openly to those who seek Him with all their heart, and to be hidden from those who flee from Him with all their heart, He so regulates the knowledge of Himself that He has given signs of Himself, visible to those who seek Him, and not to those who seek Him not. 
他愿意让那些人很容易认出他自己。因此，他愿意向那些全心全意寻求他的人公开显现，而对那些全心全意逃离他的人隐藏起来，他如此规范对自己的认识，以至于他给了那些人可见的自己的迹象。那些寻求他的人，而不是那些不寻求他的人。
"There is enough light for those who only desire to see, and enough obscurity for those who have a contrary disposition.""   431  No other religion has recognised that man is the most excellent creature. "
对于那些只想看到的人来说，有足够的光明，对于那些有相反性情的人来说，有足够的黑暗。”431没有其他宗教承认人类是最优秀的生物。
Some, which have quite recognised the reality of his excellence, have considered as mean and ungrateful the low opinions which men naturally have of themselves; and others, which have thoroughly recognised how real is this vileness, have treated with proud ridicule those feelings of greatness, which are equally natural to man. 
有些人虽然承认他的卓越，却认为人们对自己的低评价是卑鄙和忘恩负义的。而另一些人则彻底认识到这种卑鄙的行为是多么真实，他们以自豪的嘲笑态度对待那些对人类同样自然的伟大感觉。
" ""Lift your eyes to God,"" say the first; ""see Him whom you resemble, and who has created you to worship Him. "
第一个说：“举目仰望上帝”； “看看你所相似的那一位，他创造了你来敬拜他。
"You can make yourselves like unto Him; wisdom will make you equal to Him, if you will follow it."" ""Raise your heads, free men,"" says Epictetus. "
你们可以使自己变得像他一样；如果你愿意追随智慧，智慧将使你与他平等。”“自由人，抬起头来，”爱比克泰德说。
"And others say, ""Bend your eyes to the earth, wretched worm that you are, and consider the brutes whose companion you are.""  What, then, will man become? Will he be equal to God or the brutes? What a frightful difference! What, then, shall we be? Who does not see from all this that man has gone astray, that he has fallen from his place, that he anxiously seeks it, that he cannot find it again? And who shall then direct him to it? The greatest men have failed. "
还有人说：“把你的眼睛转向地球吧，你这个可怜的虫子，想想那些与你为伴的畜生吧。”那么，人会变成什么样子呢？他会与上帝平等还是与畜生平等？这是多么可怕的差别啊！那么，我们会怎样呢？从这一切中谁看不到人已经误入歧途，他已经离开了自己的位置，他焦急地寻找着它，却再也找不到它了？那么谁来指导他呢？最伟大的人都失败了。
  432  Scepticism is true; for, after all, men before Jesus Christ did not know where they were, nor whether they were great or small. 
第432章 怀疑是真的；毕竟，在耶稣基督之前，人们不知道自己在哪里，也不知道自己是伟大还是渺小。
And those who have said the one or the other, knew nothing about it, and guessed without reason and by chance. 
而那些说出其中之一的人对此一无所知，只是毫无理由地、偶然地猜测。
They also erred always in excluding the one or the other. 
他们也总是错误地排除其中之一。
 _Quod ergo ignorantes, quæritis, religio annuntiat vobis._[160]   433  _After having understood the whole nature of man._--That a religion may be true, it must have knowledge of our nature. 
 _Quod ergo ignorantes, quæritis, religio annuntiat vobis._[160] 433 _在了解了人类的全部本性之后。_-宗教要想是真实的，它必须了解我们的本性。
It ought to know its greatness and littleness, and the reason of both. 
它应该知道它的伟大和渺小，以及两者的原因。
What religion but the Christian has known this?   434  The chief arguments of the sceptics--I pass over the lesser ones--are that we have no certainty of the truth of these principles apart from faith and revelation, except in so far as we naturally perceive them in ourselves. 
除了基督徒之外，还有哪个宗教知道这一点呢？ 434 怀疑论者的主要论点——我忽略了较小的论点——是，除了信仰和启示之外，我们无法确定这些原则的真实性，除非我们在自己身上自然地感知到它们。
Now this natural intuition is not a convincing proof of their truth; since, having no certainty, apart from faith, whether man was created by a good God, or by a wicked demon,[161] or by chance, it is doubtful whether these principles given to us are true, or false, or uncertain, according to our origin. 
现在，这种自然直觉并不能令人信服地证明他们的真理；因为，除了信仰之外，无法确定人类是否是由善良的上帝创造的，还是由邪恶的恶魔创造的，[161]还是偶然，所以我们怀疑这些给予我们的原则是真实的、虚假的还是不确定的，根据我们的起源。
Again, no person is certain, apart from faith, whether he is awake or sleeps, seeing that during sleep we believe that we are awake as firmly as we do when we _are_ awake; we believe that we see space, figure, and motion; we are aware of the passage of time, we measure it; and in fact we act as if we were awake. 
再次强调，除了信仰之外，没有人能确定自己是醒着还是睡着，因为在睡眠期间，我们坚信自己是醒着的，就像我们醒着时一样。我们相信我们看到了空间、图形和运动；我们意识到时间的流逝，我们测量它；事实上，我们表现得就好像我们是醒着的一样。
So that half of our life being passed in sleep, we have on our own admission no idea of truth, whatever we may imagine. 
因此，我们生命的一半是在睡眠中度过的，我们自己承认，无论我们如何想象，对真理一无所知。
As all our intuitions are then illusions, who knows whether the other half of our life, in which we think we are awake, is not another sleep a little different from the former, from which we awake when we suppose ourselves asleep?  [And who doubts that, if we dreamt in company, and the dreams chanced to agree, which is common enough, and if we were always alone when awake, we should believe that matters were reversed? In short, as we often dream that we dream, heaping dream upon dream, may it not be that this half of our life, wherein we think ourselves awake, is itself only a dream on which the others are grafted, from which we wake at death, during which we have as few principles of truth and good as during natural sleep, these different thoughts which disturb us being perhaps only illusions like the flight of time and the vain fancies of our dreams?]  These are the chief arguments on one side and the other. 
既然我们所有的直觉都是幻觉，谁知道我们认为自己醒着的生命的另一半是否是另一种睡眠，与我们以为自己睡着时醒来的前半生略有不同？ [谁会怀疑，如果我们一起做梦，而且梦境碰巧一致（这很常见），如果我们醒着时总是独自一人，我们应该相信事情已经逆转了？简而言之，正如我们经常梦见我们在做梦，把梦叠在梦上，我们以为自己醒着的这半生，也许不是它本身只是一个梦，其他的梦都嫁接在上面，我们从梦中醒来。死亡期间，我们与自然睡眠期间一样缺乏真理和善的原则，这些扰乱我们的不同想法也许只是幻象，如时间的流逝和我们梦中的虚幻幻想？]这些是一方面的主要论点和另一个。
 I omit minor ones, such as the sceptical talk against the impressions of custom, education, manners, country, and the like. 
我省略了一些次要的内容，例如针对习俗、教育、礼仪、国家等印象的怀疑论。
Though these influence the majority of common folk, who dogmatise only on shallow foundations, they are upset by the least breath of the sceptics. 
尽管这些影响了大多数普通民众，他们只是在肤浅的基础上教条，但怀疑论者的一丝一毫的怀疑都会让他们感到不安。
We have only to see their books if we are not sufficiently convinced of this, and we shall very quickly become so, perhaps too much. 
如果我们还没有充分相信这一点，我们就只能看看他们的书，而且我们很快就会变得如此，也许太多了。
 I notice the only strong point of the dogmatists, namely, that, speaking in good faith and sincerely, we cannot doubt natural principles. 
我注意到教条主义者唯一的长处，就是，真诚地说话，我们不能怀疑自然原理。
Against this the sceptics set up in one word the uncertainty of our origin, which includes that of our nature. 
针对这一点，怀疑论者用一个词提出了我们起源的不确定性，其中包括我们本性的不确定性。
The dogmatists have been trying to answer this objection ever since the world began. 
自世界诞生以来，教条主义者就一直试图回答这个反对意见。
 So there is open war among men, in which each must take a part, and side either with dogmatism or scepticism. 
因此，人类之间存在着公开的战争，每个人都必须参与其中，要么站在教条主义一边，要么站在怀疑主义一边。
For he who thinks to remain neutral is above all a sceptic. 
对于那些认为保持中立的人来说，首先是一个怀疑论者。
This neutrality is the essence of the sect; he who is not against them is essentially for them. 
这种中立性是该教派的本质。不反对他们的人本质上是支持他们的。
[In this appears their advantage.] They are not for themselves; they are neutral, indifferent, in suspense as to all things, even themselves being no exception. 
 [这就是他们的优势。]他们不是为了自己；而是为了自己。他们对一切事物都是中立的、冷漠的、悬念的，连自己也不例外。
 What then shall man do in this state? Shall he doubt everything? Shall he doubt whether he is awake, whether he is being pinched, or whether he is being burned? Shall he doubt whether he doubts? Shall he doubt whether he exists? We cannot go so far as that; and I lay it down as a fact that there never has been a real complete sceptic. 
那么人在这种状态下该怎么办呢？他会怀疑一切吗？他会怀疑自己是否醒着、是否被掐、是否被烧伤？他会怀疑吗？他会怀疑自己是否存在吗？我们不能走得那么远；我承认，从来没有一个真正的彻底怀疑论者。
Nature sustains our feeble reason, and prevents it raving to this extent. 
大自然支撑着我们微弱的理性，并阻止它胡言乱语到这种程度。
 Shall he then say, on the contrary, that he certainly possesses truth--he who, when pressed ever so little, can show no title to it, and is forced to let go his hold?  What a chimera then is man! What a novelty! What a monster, what a chaos, what a contradiction, what a prodigy! Judge of all things, imbecile worm of the earth; depositary of truth, a sink of uncertainty and error; the pride and refuse of the universe!  Who will unravel this tangle? Nature confutes the sceptics, and reason confutes the dogmatists. 
那么，他是否会说，相反，他确实拥有真理——当他受到如此小的压力时，他无法表现出对它的所有权，并被迫放弃他的掌握？人类真是一个怪物啊！多么新奇啊！多么怪物，多么混乱，多么矛盾，多么神童！万物的审判者，地球上愚蠢的蠕虫；真理的保存者，不确定性和错误的汇集地；宇宙的骄傲和拒绝！谁来解开这个纠结？自然驳斥了怀疑论者，理性驳斥了教条主义者。
What then will you become, O men! who try to find out by your natural reason what is your true condition? You cannot avoid one of these sects, nor adhere to one of them. 
那么你们会变成什么样子啊，人类啊！谁试图通过你的自然理性找出你的真实状况？你无法避开这些教派之一，也无法追随其中之一。
 Know then, proud man, what a paradox you are to yourself. 
那么，骄傲的人，你要知道，你对自己来说是一个多么矛盾的人。
Humble yourself, weak reason; be silent, foolish nature; learn that man infinitely transcends man, and learn from your Master your true condition, of which you are ignorant. 
谦卑自己，软弱的理性；沉默寡言，本性愚昧；了解人类无限超越人类，并从你的导师那里了解你所不知道的真实状况。
Hear God. 
听神的话。
 For in fact, if man had never been corrupt, he would enjoy in his innocence both truth and happiness with assurance; and if man had always been corrupt, he would have no idea of truth or bliss. 
事实上，如果人从未败坏，他就会在纯真中放心地享受真理和幸福。如果人总是腐败的，他就不会知道真理或幸福。
But, wretched as we are, and more so than if there were no greatness in our condition, we have an idea of happiness, and cannot reach it. 
但是，尽管我们很不幸，而且我们的处境并不伟大，但我们对幸福却抱有一种想法，却无法实现它。
We perceive an image of truth, and possess only a lie. 
我们看到的是真实的形象，但拥有的只是谎言。
Incapable of absolute ignorance and of certain knowledge, we have thus been manifestly in a degree of perfection from which we have unhappily fallen. 
我们无法拥有绝对的无知和一定的知识，因此显然我们已经达到了一定程度的完美，但不幸的是，我们已经从完美的程度堕落了。
 It is, however, an astonishing thing that the mystery furthest removed from our knowledge, namely, that of the transmission of sin, should be a fact without which we can have no knowledge of ourselves. 
然而，令人惊讶的是，我们所不知道的奥秘，即罪的传递，竟然是一个事实，没有它我们就无法认识自己。
For it is beyond doubt that there is nothing which more shocks our reason than to say that the sin of the first man has rendered guilty those, who, being so removed from this source, seem incapable of participation in it. 
因为毫无疑问，没有什么比说第一个人的罪使那些远离这个源头、似乎无法参与其中的人有罪更让我们的理性震惊的了。
This transmission does not only seem to us impossible, it seems also very unjust. 
这种传递不仅在我们看来是不可能的，而且似乎也是非常不公正的。
For what is more contrary to the rules of our miserable justice than to damn eternally an infant incapable of will, for a sin wherein he seems to have so little a share, that it was committed six thousand years before he was in existence? Certainly nothing offends us more rudely than this doctrine; and yet, without this mystery, the most incomprehensible of all, we are incomprehensible to ourselves. 
因为还有什么比永远诅咒一个没有意志力的婴儿更违反我们可悲的正义的规则的呢？因为他似乎没有参与一项罪孽，而这罪孽是在他存在六千年前就犯下的？当然，没有什么比这个学说更粗鲁地冒犯我们了。然而，如果没有这个最难以理解的奥秘，我们就无法理解我们自己。
The knot of our condition takes its twists and turns in this abyss, so that man is more inconceivable without this mystery than this mystery is inconceivable to man. 
我们的处境的结在这个深渊中曲折，因此，没有这个奥秘，人类就比这个奥秘对人类来说是不可想象的更加不可想象。
 [Whence it seems that God, willing to render the difficulty of our existence unintelligible to ourselves, has concealed the knot so high, or, better speaking, so low, that we are quite incapable of reaching it; so that it is not by the proud exertions of our reason, but by the simple submissions of reason, that we can truly know ourselves. 
 [由此看来，上帝愿意让我们的生存困难变得难以理解，因此将这个结隐藏得如此之高，或者更准确地说，隐藏得如此之低，以至于我们完全无法触及它；因此，我们不是靠理性的骄傲努力，而是靠理性的简单服从，才能真正认识自己。
 These foundations, solidly established on the inviolable authority of religion, make us know that there are two truths of faith equally certain: the one, that man, in the state of creation, or in that of grace, is raised above all nature, made like unto God and sharing in His divinity; the other, that in the state of corruption and sin, he is fallen from this state and made like unto the beasts. 
这些牢固地建立在不可侵犯的宗教权威之上的基础，使我们知道有两个同样确定的信仰真理：一是人在受造的状态下，或在恩典的状态下，被提升到高于一切自然之上，被创造出来。像神一样并分享他的神性；另一方面，在腐败和罪恶的状态下，他从这种状态中堕落，变得像野兽一样。
 These two propositions are equally sound and certain. 
这两个命题同样合理、确定。
Scripture manifestly declares this to us, when it says in some places: _Deliciæ meæ esse cum filiis hominum.[162] Effundam spiritum meum super omnem carnem.[163] Dii estis[164]_, etc.; and in other places, _Omnis caro fænum.[165] Homo assimilatus est jumentis insipientibus, et similis factus est illis.[166] Dixi in corde meo de filiis hominum._ Eccles. 
圣经在某些地方说：“我喜悦世人。”[162]我要将我的灵浇灌凡有血气的。[163]你是上帝的[164]_等；在其他地方，_所有的肉都是干草。[165]人被比作愚蠢的野兽，而他也变得像它们一样。 [166]我心里说的是人类之子。

三.
 Whence it clearly seems that man by grace is made like unto God, and a partaker in His divinity, and that without grace he is like unto the brute beasts.]   435  Without this divine knowledge what could men do but either become elated by the inner feeling of their past greatness which still remains to them, or become despondent at the sight of their present weakness? For, not seeing the whole truth, they could not attain to perfect virtue. 
由此看来，人显然是靠恩典而被造得像上帝，并分享他的神性，没有恩典，他就像野兽一样。] 435 没有这种神圣的知识，人除了因内在的内在而得意之外，还能做什么呢？感受到他们过去的伟大仍然存在，还是看到他们现在的弱点而感到沮丧？因为，如果看不到全部真相，他们就无法获得完美的德行。
Some considering nature as incorrupt, others as incurable, they could not escape either pride or sloth, the two sources of all vice; since they cannot but either abandon themselves to it through cowardice, or escape it by pride. 
有些人认为自然是廉洁的，另一些人则认为自然是无药可救的，他们无法摆脱骄傲或懒惰，这是所有罪恶的两个根源；因为他们只能要么因怯懦而屈服于它，要么因骄傲而逃避它。
For if they knew the excellence of man, they were ignorant of his corruption; so that they easily avoided sloth, but fell into pride. 
因为，如果他们知道人的优秀，他们就不会意识到人的败坏。以致他们很容易避免懒惰，却陷入骄傲。
And if they recognised the infirmity of nature, they were ignorant of its dignity; so that they could easily avoid vanity, but it was to fall into despair. 
如果他们认识到自然的脆弱性，他们就忽视了它的尊严。这样他们就可以轻松避免虚荣心，但却陷入绝望。
Thence arise the different schools of the Stoics and Epicureans, the Dogmatists, Academicians, etc. 
由此产生了斯多亚学派、伊壁鸠鲁学派、教条主义者、学院派等不同学派。
 The Christian religion alone has been able to cure these two vices, not by expelling the one through means of the other according to the wisdom of the world, but by expelling both according to the simplicity of the Gospel. 
只有基督教才能够治愈这两种罪恶，不是按照世人的智慧通过另一种手段来驱逐一种罪恶，而是按照福音的简单性来驱逐这两种罪恶。
For it teaches the righteous that it raises them even to a participation in divinity itself; that in this lofty state they still carry the source of all corruption, which renders them during all their life subject to error, misery, death, and sin; and it proclaims to the most ungodly that they are capable of the grace of their Redeemer. 
因为它教导义人，它甚至提升他们参与神性本身。在这种崇高的状态下，他们仍然携带着所有腐败的根源，这使他们一生都遭受错误、痛苦、死亡和罪恶；它向最不敬虔的人宣告他们也能得到救赎主的恩典。
So making those tremble whom it justifies, and consoling those whom it condemns, religion so justly tempers fear with hope through that double capacity of grace and of sin, common to all, that it humbles infinitely more than reason alone can do, but without despair; and it exalts infinitely more than natural pride, but without inflating; thus making it evident that alone being exempt from error and vice, it alone fulfils the duty of instructing and correcting men. 
因此，宗教使那些被它辩护的人颤抖，安慰那些被它谴责的人，宗教如此公正地通过所有人共有的恩典和罪恶的双重能力，以希望调和恐惧，以至于它比理性所能做的无限谦卑，但并不绝望;它比自然的骄傲更加高尚，但并不膨胀；由此可见，只有免于错误和罪恶，它才能够履行指导和纠正人们的职责。
 Who then can refuse to believe and adore this heavenly light? For is it not clearer than day that we perceive within ourselves ineffaceable marks of excellence? And is it not equally true that we experience every hour the results of our deplorable condition? What does this chaos and monstrous confusion proclaim to us but the truth of these two states, with a voice so powerful that it is impossible to resist it?   436  _Weakness._--Every pursuit of men is to get wealth; and they cannot have a title to show that they possess it justly, for they have only that of human caprice; nor have they strength to hold it securely. 
谁能拒绝相信和崇拜这天上的光呢？因为，我们在自己身上察觉到不可磨灭的卓越标志，这不是比白天更清楚吗？我们每时每刻都在经历我们的悲惨处境所带来的后果，这难道不是同样正确的吗？除了这两种状态的真相，这种混乱和巨大的混乱向我们宣告了什么，其声音如此强大，以至于无法抗拒？ 436_弱点._--人的一切追求都是为了获得财富；他们无法拥有权利来表明他们公正地拥有它，因为他们只有人类任性的权利。他们也没有力量牢固地握住它。
It is the same with knowledge, for disease takes it away. 
知识也是如此，因为疾病会夺走它。
We are incapable both of truth and goodness. 
我们既无法追求真理，也无法追求良善。
  437  We desire truth, and find within ourselves only uncertainty. 
 437 我们渴望真理，但发现我们内心只有不确定性。
 We seek happiness, and find only misery and death. 
我们寻求幸福，却发现只有痛苦和死亡。
 We cannot but desire truth and happiness, and are incapable of certainty or happiness. 
我们只能渴望真理和幸福，但却无法获得确定性或幸福。
This desire is left to us, partly to punish us, partly to make us perceive wherefrom we are fallen. 
这种欲望留给我们，部分是为了惩罚我们，部分是为了让我们认识到自己是从哪里堕落的。
  438  If man is not made for God, why is he only happy in God? If man is made for God, why is he so opposed to God?   439  _Nature corrupted._--Man does not act by reason, which constitutes his being. 
 438 人若不是为神而造，为何唯有在神里面才有快乐？如果人是为神而造的，为什么他如此抵挡神呢？ 439_自然败坏。_--人不按理性行事，而理性构成了他的存在。
  440  The corruption of reason is shown by the existence of so many different and extravagant customs. 
 440 如此多不同且奢侈的习俗的存在表明了理性的败坏。
It was necessary that truth should come, in order that man should no longer dwell within himself. 
真理必须到来，这样人就不再停留在自己的内心了。
  441  For myself, I confess that so soon as the Christian religion reveals the principle that human nature is corrupt and fallen from God, that opens my eyes to see everywhere the mark of this truth: for nature is such that she testifies everywhere, both within man and without him, to a lost God and a corrupt nature. 
 441 就我自己而言，我承认，一旦基督教揭示了人性败坏并从上帝那里堕落的原则，我的眼睛就会睁开眼睛，到处都能看到这个真理的标志：因为自然就是这样，她在任何地方都证明了这一点，无论是在人，没有他，就会失去上帝和败坏的本性。
  442  Man's true nature, his true good, true virtue, and true religion, are things of which the knowledge is inseparable. 
 442 人的真实本性、真实良善、真实美德和真实宗教，都是与知识密不可分的事物。
  443  _Greatness, wretchedness._--The more light we have, the more greatness and the more baseness we discover in man. 
443_伟大，不幸。_--我们拥有的光明越多，我们就越发现人的伟大和卑鄙。
Ordinary men--those who are more educated: philosophers, they astonish ordinary men--Christians, they astonish philosophers. 
普通人——那些受过更多教育的人：哲学家，他们让普通人感到惊讶——基督徒，他们让哲学家感到惊讶。
 Who will then be surprised to see that religion only makes us know profoundly what we already know in proportion to our light?   444  This religion taught to her children what men have only been able to discover by their greatest knowledge. 
那么谁会惊讶地发现宗教只能让我们深刻地了解我们已经知道的与我们的光成比例的事情呢？ 444 这种宗教向她的孩子们传授人类只有通过他们最伟大的知识才能发现的东西。
  445  Original sin is foolishness to men, but it is admitted to be such. 
 445 原罪对人来说是愚蠢的，但它确实如此。
You must not then reproach me for the want of reason in this doctrine, since I admit it to be without reason. 
那么你就不能因为这个学说缺乏理由而责备我，因为我承认它是没有理由的。
But this foolishness is wiser than all the wisdom of men, _sapientius est hominibus_.[167] For without this, what can we say that man is? His whole state depends on this imperceptible point. 
但这种愚蠢比人类所有的智慧都要聪明，_sapientius est hominibus_。[167]如果没有这一点，我们还能说人是什么？他的整个状态就取决于这个难以察觉的点。
"And how should it be perceived by his reason, since it is a thing against reason, and since reason, far from finding it out by her own ways, is averse to it when it is presented to her?   446  _Of original sin.[168] Ample tradition of original sin according to the Jews._  On the saying in Genesis viii, 21: ""The imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth.""  _R. "
既然它是违背理性的东西，而且理性远非以她自己的方式发现它，当它被呈现给她时，她又会反感它，那么他的理性应该如何看待它呢？ [168]第166章根据犹太人的说法，原罪有丰富的传统。_关于《创世记》第八章第 21 节中的一句话：“人自幼心里怀着恶念。” _R。
Moses Haddarschan_: This evil leaven is placed in man from the time that he is formed. 
 Moses Haddarschan_：这种邪恶的酵母从人被形成的那一刻起就被放置在人体内。
 _Massechet Succa_: This evil leaven has seven names in Scripture. 
 _Massechet Succa_：这种邪恶的酵母在圣经中有七个名字。
It is called _evil, the foreskin, uncleanness, an enemy, a scandal, a heart of stone, the north wind_; all this signifies the malignity which is concealed and impressed in the heart of man. 
它被称为“邪恶、包皮、不洁、敌人、丑闻、铁石心肠、北风”；这一切都表明了人内心隐藏和铭记的恶毒。
 _Midrasch Tillim_ says the same thing, and that God will deliver the good nature of man from the evil. 
米德拉什·蒂利姆 (Midrasch Tillim) 也说过同样的话，上帝会将人的善良本性从邪恶中拯救出来。
" This malignity is renewed every day against man, as it is written, Psalm xxxvii, 32: ""The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him""; but God will not abandon him. "
这种恶毒每天都在针对人类，正如《诗篇》第 37 篇第 32 篇所写：“恶人窥探义人，想要杀他”；但上帝不会抛弃他。
This malignity tries the heart of man in this life, and will accuse him in the other. 
这种恶意在今生考验人的心，并在来世控告他。
All this is found in the Talmud. 
所有这些都可以在《塔木德》中找到。
" _Midrasch Tillim_ on Psalm iv, 4: ""Stand in awe and sin not."" Stand in awe and be afraid of your lust, and it will not lead you into sin. "
 _Midrasch Tillim_ 论诗篇第四篇，第四篇：“要存敬畏之心，不要犯罪。”敬畏并害怕你的情欲，它不会导致你犯罪。
"And on Psalm xxxvi, 1: ""The wicked has said within his own heart, Let not the fear of God be before me."" That is to say that the malignity natural to man has said that to the wicked. "
诗篇第 36 篇第 1 篇：“恶人心里说，不要敬畏上帝。”也就是说，人的本性的恶毒已经对恶人说了这样的话。
" _Midrasch el Kohelet_: ""Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king who cannot foresee the future.""[169] The child is virtue, and the king is the malignity of man. "
 _Midrasch el Kohelet_：“一个贫穷而聪明的孩子比一个无法预见未来的年老而愚蠢的国王更好。”[169]孩子是美德，而国王是人的恶毒。
It is called king because all the members obey it, and old because it is in the human heart from infancy to old age, and foolish because it leads man in the way of [_perdition_], which he does not foresee. 
它被称为国王，因为所有成员都服从它；它被称为古老，因为它从婴儿到老年都存在于人类心中；它被称为愚蠢，因为它引导人类走上他无法预见的[_灭亡_]之路。
The same thing is in _Midrasch Tillim_. 
 _Midrasch Tillim_ 也是如此。
" _Bereschist Rabba_ on Psalm xxxv, 10: ""Lord, all my bones shall bless Thee, which deliverest the poor from the tyrant."" And is there a greater tyrant than the evil leaven? And on Proverbs xxv, 21: ""If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat."" That is to say, if the evil leaven hunger, give him the bread of wisdom of which it is spoken in Proverbs ix., and if he be thirsty, give him the water of which it is spoken in Isaiah lv. "
 _Bereschist Rabba_论诗篇 xxxv，10：“主啊，我所有的骨头都将祝福你，你将穷人从暴君手中解救出来。”还有比邪恶酵母更大的暴君吗？箴言二十五章 21 节说：“如果你的敌人饿了，就给他食物吃。”也就是说，如果恶酵饥饿，就给他箴言九章里所说的智慧粮；如果他渴了，就给他以赛亚书六章六节里所说的水。
 _Midrasch Tillim_ says the same thing, and that Scripture in that passage, speaking of the enemy, means the evil leaven; and that, in [_giving_] him that bread and that water, we heap coals of fire on his head. 
米德拉什·蒂利姆（Midrasch Tillim）也说了同样的话，而那段经文中提到敌人时，指的是邪恶的酵母；在给他面包和水时，我们把炭火堆在他的头上。
" _Midrasch el Kohelet_ on Ecclesiastes ix, 14: ""A great king besieged a little city."" This great king is the evil leaven; the great bulwarks built against it are temptations; and there has been found a poor wise man who has delivered it--that is to say, virtue. "
_Midrasch el Kohelet_ 在《传道书》第九章第 14 章中：“一位伟大的国王围困了一座小城。”这位伟大的王就是邪恶的酵；抵御它的伟大堡垒是诱惑；已经找到了一位可怜的智者，他传递了它——也就是说，美德。
" And on Psalm xli, 1: ""Blessed is he that considereth the poor.""  And on Psalm lxxviii, 39: ""The spirit passeth away, and cometh not again""; whence some have erroneously argued against the immortality of the soul. "
诗篇第 11 篇第 1 篇：“眷顾穷人的有福了。”诗篇二十八篇第 39 篇：“圣灵去了，不再来”；因此，有些人错误地反对灵魂不朽。
But the sense is that this spirit is the evil leaven, which accompanies man till death, and will not return at the resurrection. 
但感觉是这种灵是邪恶的酵，它伴随着人直到死亡，并且在复活时不会回来。
 And on Psalm ciii the same thing. 
在《诗篇 ciii》中也是如此。
 And on Psalm xvi. 
还有诗篇十六。
 Principles of Rabbinism: two Messiahs. 
拉比主义的原则：两个弥赛亚。
  447  Will it be said that, as men have declared that righteousness has departed the earth, they therefore knew of original sin?--_Nemo ante obitum beatus est_[170]--that is to say, they knew death to be the beginning of eternal and essential happiness?   448  [_Miton_] sees well that nature is corrupt, and that men are averse to virtue; but he does not know why they cannot fly higher. 
447 是否可以说，正如人们宣称正义已离开地球，他们因此知道原罪？--_Nemo ante obitumbeatus est_[170]--也就是说，他们知道死亡是生命的开始永恒而本质的幸福？ 448 [_Miton_] 清楚地看到自然是腐败的，人们厌恶美德；但他不知道为什么他们不能飞得更高。
"  449  _Order._--After _Corruption_ to say: ""It is right that all those who are in that state should know it, both those who are content with it, and those who are not content with it; but it is not right that all should see Redemption.""   450  If we do not know ourselves to be full of pride, ambition, lust, weakness, misery, and injustice, we are indeed blind. "
第449章所有人都应该看到救赎。” 450 如果我们不知道自己充满了骄傲、野心、色欲、软弱、痛苦和不公正，我们确实是盲目的。
And if, knowing this, we do not desire deliverance, what can we say of a man...?  What, then, can we have but esteem for a religion which knows so well the defects of man, and desire for the truth of a religion which promises remedies so desirable?   451  All men naturally hate one another. 
如果知道这一点，我们不渴望解脱，我们还能对一个人说什么……？那么，我们除了尊重一个如此了解人类缺陷的宗教，并渴望一个承诺如此理想的补救措施的宗教的真理之外，还能有什么呢？ 451 所有的人都自然地互相憎恨。
They employ lust as far as possible in the service of the public weal. 
他们尽可能利用欲望来为公共福利服务。
But this is only a [_pretence_] and a false image of love; for at bottom it is only hate. 
但这只是一种[_借口_]和爱情的虚假形象；因为归根结底只是仇恨。
  452  To pity the unfortunate is not contrary to lust. 
 452 怜悯不幸者，并不违背情欲。
On the contrary, we can quite well give such evidence of friendship, and acquire the reputation of kindly feeling, without giving anything. 
相反，我们完全可以在不付出任何东西的情况下给出这种友谊的证据，并获得友善的声誉。
  453  From lust men have found and extracted excellent rules of policy, morality, and justice; but in reality this vile root of man, this _figmentum malum_,[171] is only covered, it is not taken away. 
 453 人们从欲望中发现并提取了政策、道德和正义的优秀规则；但实际上，人类的这个卑鄙根源，这个_figmentum malum_，[171]只是被覆盖，而没有被去除。
  454  _Injustice._--They have not found any other means of satisfying lust without doing injury to others. 
 454 _不公正._--他们没有找到任何其他方法来满足欲望而不伤害他人。
  455  Self is hateful. 
第455章 自己可恨。
You, Miton, conceal it; you do not for that reason destroy it; you are, then, always hateful. 
你，米东，把它藏起来；你不会因此而毁掉它；那么，你总是可恨的。
 --No; for in acting as we do to oblige everybody, we give no more occasion for hatred of us.--That is true, if we only hated in Self the vexation which comes to us from it. 
 - 不;因为当我们采取行动去帮助每个人时，我们就不会再有机会憎恨我们——这是真的，如果我们只是在自我中憎恨由此而生的烦恼的话。
But if I hate it because it is unjust, and because it makes itself the centre of everything, I shall always hate it. 
但如果我因为它不公正而讨厌它，因为它使自己成为一切的中心，那么我将永远讨厌它。
 In a word, the Self has two qualities: it is unjust in itself since it makes itself the centre of everything; it is inconvenient to others since it would enslave them; for each Self is the enemy, and would like to be the tyrant of all others. 
总而言之，自我有两个品质：它本身是不公正的，因为它使自己成为一切的中心；它本身是不公正的，因为它使自己成为一切的中心；这会给其他人带来不便，因为这会奴役他们；因为每个自我都是敌人，并且想成为所有其他自我的暴君。
You take away its inconvenience, but not its injustice, and so you do not render it lovable to those who hate injustice; you render it lovable only to the unjust, who do not any longer find in it an enemy. 
你消除了它的不便，但没有消除它的不公正，因此你不会让它受到那些憎恨不公正的人的喜爱；你只让不公正的人喜爱它，他们不再把它视为敌人。
And thus you remain unjust, and can please only the unjust. 
因此，你仍然是不公正的，并且只能取悦不公正的人。
  456  It is a perverted judgment that makes every one place himself above the rest of the world, and prefer his own good, and the continuance of his own good fortune and life, to that of the rest of the world!   457  Each one is all in all to himself; for he being dead, all is dead to him. 
456这是一种扭曲的判断，使每个人都将自己置于世界其他人之上，并且优先考虑自己的利益以及自己的福祉和生命的延续，而不是世界其他人的利益！第457章 每一个人都是自己的一切；因为他死了，一切对他来说都死了。
Hence it comes that each believes himself to be all in all to everybody. 
因此，每个人都相信自己是每个人的一切。
We must not judge of nature by ourselves, but by it. 
我们不能凭自己来判断自然，而应该根据自然来判断。
"  458  ""All that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, or the lust of the eyes, or the pride of life; _libido sentiendi, libido sciendi, libido dominandi._""[172] Wretched is the cursed land which these three rivers of fire enflame rather than water![173] Happy they who, on these rivers, are not overwhelmed nor carried away, but are immovably fixed, not standing but seated on a low and secure base, whence they do not rise before the light, but, having rested in peace, stretch out their hands to Him, who must lift them up, and make them stand upright and firm in the porches of the holy Jerusalem! There pride can no longer assail them nor cast them down; and yet they weep, not to see all those perishable things swept away by the torrents, but at the remembrance of their loved country, the heavenly Jerusalem, which they remember without ceasing during their prolonged exile. "
458 “世界上的一切都是肉体的情欲，或眼睛的情欲，或生命的骄傲；_libido sentiendi，libido sciendi，libido dominandi。_”[172]这三个人所统治的被诅咒的土地是悲惨的火河比水燃烧！[173]幸福的人，在这些河流上，没有被压倒或被带走，而是被固定不动，不是站立而是坐在低矮而安全的底座上，从那里他们不会在光面前升起，但是，在安息之后，请将他们的手伸向他，他必须举起他们，使他们在圣耶路撒冷的门廊上直立站立！在那里，骄傲不再能攻击他们，也不能击垮他们；然而，他们哭泣，不是因为看到所有那些易腐烂的东西被洪流冲走，而是因为想起他们所爱的国家，天上的耶路撒冷，他们在长期流亡期间不断地怀念它。
  459  The rivers of Babylon rush and fall and sweep away. 
 459 巴比伦的河流汹涌澎湃、倾泻而去。
 O holy Sion, where all is firm and nothing falls!  We must sit upon the waters, not under them or in them, but on them; and not standing but seated; being seated to be humble, and being above them to be secure. 
哦，神圣的锡安，一切都是坚定的，没有任何东西会倒塌！我们必须坐在水面上，不是在水面之下或水中，而是在水面上；不是站着而是坐着；坐则卑，居上则安。
But we shall stand in the porches of Jerusalem. 
但我们将站在耶路撒冷的门廊里。
 Let us see if this pleasure is stable or transitory; if it pass away, it is a river of Babylon. 
让我们看看这种快乐是稳定的还是短暂的？如果它过去了，它就是巴比伦河。
  460  _The lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, pride, etc._--There are three orders of things: the flesh, the spirit, and the will. 
 460_肉体的情欲、眼目的情欲、骄傲等_--事物有三等：肉体、灵、意志。
The carnal are the rich and kings; they have the body as their object. 
属肉体的人是富人和国王；他们以身体为对象。
Inquirers and scientists; they have the mind as their object. 
探究者和科学家；他们以心为对象。
The wise; they have righteousness as their object. 
智者;他们以正义为目标。
 God must reign over all, and all men must be brought back to Him. 
上帝必须统治一切，所有的人都必须被带回到他身边。
In things of the flesh lust reigns specially; in intellectual matters, inquiry specially; in wisdom, pride specially. 
在肉体的事上，情欲尤其占主导地位；在智力问题上，要特别探究；智慧，特别是骄傲。
Not that a man cannot boast of wealth or knowledge, but it is not the place for pride; for in granting to a man that he is learned, it is easy to convince him that he is wrong to be proud. 
并不是说一个人不能夸耀财富或知识，但这不是值得骄傲的地方；因为当一个人承认他有学问时，很容易让他相信他骄傲是错误的。
The proper place for pride is in wisdom, for it cannot be granted to a man that he has made himself wise, and that he is wrong to be proud; for that is right. 
骄傲的适当位置在于智慧，因为一个人不能认为他使自己变得聪明，也不能认为他骄傲是错误的。因为这是对的。
Now God alone gives wisdom, and that is why _Qui gloriatur, in Domino glorietur_.[174]   461  The three lusts have made three sects; and the philosophers have done no other thing than follow one of the three lusts. 
现在只有上帝赐予智慧，这就是为什么_Qui gloriatur, in Domino glorietur_。 [174] 461 三欲，分三派；哲学家们除了遵循三种欲望之一之外，没有做任何其他事情。
  462  _Search for the true good._--Ordinary men place the good in fortune and external goods, or at least in amusement. 
 462_寻找真正的善。_--普通人将善置于财富和外在物品中，或者至少置于娱乐中。
Philosophers have shown the vanity of all this, and have placed it where they could. 
哲学家们已经表明了这一切的虚荣心，并把它放在了他们可以放置的地方。
  463  [_Against the philosophers who believe in God without Jesus Christ_]  _Philosophers._--They believe that God alone is worthy to be loved and admired; and they have desired to be loved and admired of men, and do not know their own corruption. 
463 [_反对那些相信上帝而不相信耶稣基督的哲学家_]_哲学家_--他们相信只有上帝才值得被爱和钦佩；他们渴望被人爱戴和钦佩，却不知道自己的败坏。
If they feel full of feelings of love and admiration, and find therein their chief delight, very well, let them think themselves good. 
如果他们感到充满爱和钦佩的感觉，并从中找到最大的快乐，那么很好，让他们认为自己很好。
But if they find themselves averse to Him, if they have no inclination but the desire to establish themselves in the esteem of men, and if their whole perfection consists only in making men--but without constraint--find their happiness in loving them, I declare that this perfection is horrible. 
但是，如果他们发现自己厌恶上帝，如果他们除了渴望赢得人们的尊重之外没有任何倾向，如果他们的全部完美只在于使人们——但没有约束——在爱他们中找到幸福，我声明这种完美是可怕的。
What! they have known God, and have not desired solely that men should love Him, but that men should stop short at them! They have wanted to be the object of the voluntary delight of men. 
什么！他们认识神，不单单希望人爱他，还希望人停止！她们想成为人们自愿取悦的对象。
  464  _Philosophers._--We are full of things which take us out of ourselves. 
 464_哲学家._--我们充满了使我们脱离自我的事物。
 Our instinct makes us feel that we must seek our happiness outside ourselves. 
我们的本能让我们觉得我们必须在自己之外寻求幸福。
Our passions impel us outside, even when no objects present themselves to excite them. 
我们的激情驱使我们出去，即使没有任何物体可以激发我们的激情。
External objects tempt us of themselves, and call to us, even when we are not thinking of them. 
外部事物本身会诱惑我们，并召唤我们，即使我们没有想到它们。
"And thus philosophers have said in vain, ""Retire within yourselves, you will find your good there."" We do not believe them, and those who believe them are the most empty and the most foolish. "
因此，哲学家们徒劳地说：“退到你们自己的内心，你会在那里找到你的好处。”我们不相信他们，相信他们的人是最空虚、最愚蠢的。
"  465  The Stoics say, ""Retire within yourselves; it is there you will find your rest."" And that is not true. "
 465 斯多葛学派说：“退隐于自己之中；在那里你会找到你的安息。”但事实并非如此。
" Others say, ""Go out of yourselves; seek happiness in amusement."" And this is not true. "
还有人说：“走出自我，在娱乐中寻找快乐。”但这不是真的。
Illness comes. 
疾病来了。
 Happiness is neither without us nor within us. 
幸福既不在我们之外，也不在我们之内。
It is in God, both without us and within us. 
它在神里面，无论在我们之外还是在我们里面。
"  466  Had Epictetus seen the way perfectly, he would have said to men, ""You follow a wrong road""; he shows that there is another, but he does not lead to it. "
 466 如果爱比克泰德完全看清了这条路，他就会对人们说：“你们走错了路”；他表明还有另一个存在，但他并没有导致它。
It is the way of willing what God wills. 
这是遵行神旨意的方式。
Jesus Christ alone leads to it: _Via, veritas._[175]  The vices of Zeno[176] himself. 
只有耶稣基督才能通向它：_Via, veritas._[175] 芝诺[176] 本人的恶习。
"  467  _The reason of effects._--Epictetus.[177] Those who say, ""You have a headache;"" this is not the same thing. "
第467章_效果的原因_--爱比克泰德。[177]那些说“你头疼”的人；这不是同一件事。
We are assured of health, and not of justice; and in fact his own was nonsense. 
我们确信的是健康，而不是正义；事实上他自己的说法纯属无稽之谈。
" And yet he believed it demonstrable, when he said, ""It is either in our power or it is not."" But he did not perceive that it is not in our power to regulate the heart, and he was wrong to infer this from the fact that there were some Christians. "
然而，当他说“这要么在我们的能力范围内，要么不在我们的能力范围内”时，他相信这是可以证明的。但他没有意识到我们没有能力调节内心，他从有一些基督徒的事实来推断这一点是错误的。
  468  No other religion has proposed to men to hate themselves. 
 468 没有其他宗教建议人们憎恨自己。
No other religion then can please those who hate themselves, and who seek a Being truly lovable. 
那么，没有其他宗教能够取悦那些憎恨自己并寻求真正可爱的存在的人。
And these, if they had never heard of the religion of a God humiliated, would embrace it at once. 
而这些人，如果他们从未听说过受羞辱的上帝的宗教，他们会立即接受它。
  469  I feel that I might not have been; for the Ego consists in my thoughts. 
第469章 我觉得我可能不是；因为自我存在于我的思想中。
Therefore I, who think, would not have been, if my mother had been killed before I had life. 
因此，如果我的母亲在我出生之前就被杀了，我这个思考者就不会这样了。
I am not then a necessary being. 
那么我就不是一个必然的存在了。
In the same way I am not eternal or infinite; but I see plainly that there exists in nature a necessary Being, eternal and infinite. 
同样地，我也不是永恒的或无限的；但我清楚地看到，自然界中存在着一种必然的存在，永恒且无限。
"  470  ""Had I seen a miracle,"" say men, ""I should become converted."" How can they be sure they would do a thing of the nature of which they are ignorant? They imagine that this conversion consists in a worship of God which is like commerce, and in a communion such as they picture to themselves. "
 470 人们说：“如果我看到了奇迹，我就会皈依。”他们怎么能确定他们会做一件他们不知道的事情呢？他们想象这种转变在于对上帝的敬拜，就像商业一样，以及他们所想象的那样的交流。
True religion consists in annihilating self before that Universal Being, whom we have so often provoked, and who can justly destroy us at any time; in recognising that we can do nothing without Him, and have deserved nothing from Him but His displeasure. 
真正的宗教在于在宇宙存在面前消灭自我，我们经常激怒宇宙存在，而宇宙存在可以随时公正地摧毁我们。认识到没有他我们什么也做不了，除了他的不悦之外，我们不应该从他那里得到任何东西。
It consists in knowing that there is an unconquerable opposition between us and God, and that without a mediator there can be no communion with Him. 
它在于知道我们和神之间存在着不可克服的对立，没有中保就不可能与神相交。
  471  It is unjust that men should attach themselves to me, even though they do it with pleasure and voluntarily. 
471 人们依附于我是不公正的，即使他们是出于高兴和自愿这样做的。
I should deceive those in whom I had created this desire; for I am not the end of any, and I have not the wherewithal to satisfy them. 
我应该欺骗那些我在其中创造了这种愿望的人；因为我不是任何人的终结，我也没有足够的资金来满足他们。
Am I not about to die? And thus the object of their attachment will die. 
我不是快要死了吗？因此，他们所执着的对象将会死亡。
Therefore, as I would be blamable in causing a falsehood to be believed, though I should employ gentle persuasion, though it should be believed with pleasure, and though it should give me pleasure; even so I am blamable in making myself loved, and if I attract persons to attach themselves to me. 
因此，尽管我应该用温和的说服力，尽管我应该愉快地相信它，尽管它应该给我带来快乐，但如果我导致人们相信谎言，我就会受到指责；即便如此，如果我让自己受到爱戴，并且吸引人们依附于我，我就应该受到责备。
I ought to warn those who are ready to consent to a lie, that they ought not to believe it, whatever advantage comes to me from it; and likewise that they ought not to attach themselves to me; for they ought to spend their life and their care in pleasing God, or in seeking Him. 
我应该警告那些愿意接受谎言的人，他们不应该相信它，无论它对我有什么好处；同样，他们不应该依附于我；因为他们应该把一生的精力和精力花在取悦上帝或寻求上帝上。
  472  Self-will will never be satisfied, though it should have command of all it would; but we are satisfied from the moment we renounce it. 
472 任性虽能支配一切，却决不满足；但从我们放弃它的那一刻起，我们就满足了。
Without it we cannot be discontented; with it we cannot be content. 
没有它，我们就不会感到不满；没有它，我们就不会感到不满；没有它，我们就不会感到不满。有了它我们就不能满足。
  473  Let us imagine a body full of thinking members.[178]   474  _Members, To commence with that._--To regulate the love which we owe to ourselves, we must imagine a body full of thinking members, for we are members of the whole, and must see how each member should love itself, etc.... 
第473章 让我们想象一个充满思考成员的身体。[178]第474章....
  475  If the feet and the hands had a will of their own, they could only be in their order in submitting this particular will to the primary will which governs the whole body. 
 475如果脚和手有自己的意志，它们只能按照自己的顺序将这一特定意志服从于支配整个身体的主要意志。
Apart from that, they are in disorder and mischief; but in willing only the good of the body, they accomplish their own good. 
除此之外，他们还混乱、恶作剧；但当他们只愿意身体的好处时，他们就实现了自己的好处。
  476  We must love God only and hate self only. 
 476 我们必须只爱神，只恨自己。
 If the foot had always been ignorant that it belonged to the body, and that there was a body on which it depended, if it had only had the knowledge and the love of self, and if it came to know that it belonged to a body on which it depended, what regret, what shame for its past life, for having been useless to the body which inspired its life, which would have annihilated it if it had rejected it and separated it from itself, as it kept itself apart from the body! What prayers for its preservation in it! And with what submission would it allow itself to be governed by the will which rules the body, even to consenting, if necessary, to be cut off, or it would lose its character as member! For every member must be quite willing to perish for the body, for which alone the whole is. 
如果脚一直不知道它属于身体，不知道有一个它所依赖的身体，如果它只有自知和自爱，如果它知道它属于一个身体它所依赖的东西，对它过去的生活是多么遗憾和羞耻，因为它对激发它生命的身体毫无用处，如果它拒绝它并将它与自身分离，因为它使自己与现实分离，它就会毁灭它。身体！多么祈求它能保存在其中啊！它会以何种程度的服从来让自己受统治身体的意志的支配，甚至在必要时同意被切断，否则它将失去其作为成员的特征！因为每个成员都必须非常愿意为身体而灭亡，而整体就是为了身体而灭亡。
  477  It is false that we are worthy of the love of others; it is unfair that we should desire it. 
 477 说我们值得别人爱是错误的；我们想要它，这是不公平的。
If we were born reasonable and impartial, knowing ourselves and others, we should not give this bias to our will. 
如果我们生来理性、公正，了解自己和他人，我们就不应该让我们的意志产生这种偏见。
However, we are born with it; therefore born unjust, for all tends to self. 
然而，我们与生俱来；因此，生来就是不公正的，因为所有人都倾向于自我。
This is contrary to all order. 
这与所有秩序相悖。
We must consider the general good; and the propensity to self is the beginning of all disorder, in war, in politics, in economy, and in the particular body of man. 
我们必须考虑公共利益；自我倾向是一切混乱的开始，无论是战争、政治、经济还是人类的特殊身体。
The will is therefore depraved. 
因此意志是败坏的。
 If the members of natural and civil communities tend towards the weal of the body, the communities themselves ought to look to another more general body of which they are members. 
如果自然和公民共同体的成员倾向于集体的福祉，那么共同体本身就应该关注他们所属的另一个更普遍的集体。
We ought therefore to look to the whole. 
因此，我们应该着眼于整体。
We are therefore born unjust and depraved. 
因此，我们生来就是不公正和堕落的。
  478  When we want to think of God, is there nothing which turns us away, and tempts us to think of something else? All this is bad, and is born in us. 
 478 当我们想念神的时候，有没有什么东西可以让我们转而想别的事呢？这一切都是不好的，而且是我们与生俱来的。
  479  If there is a God, we must love Him only, and not the creatures of a day. 
 479 如果有神，我们就必须只爱他，而不是白日造物。
The reasoning of the ungodly in the book of Wisdom[179] is only based upon the non-existence of God. 
 《智慧书》[179]中不敬虔之人的推理只是基于上帝不存在。
"On that supposition, say they, ""let us take delight in the creatures."" That is the worst that can happen. "
他们说，基于这一假设，“让我们以这些生物为乐吧。”这是可能发生的最糟糕的情况。
But if there were a God to love, they would not have come to this conclusion, but to quite the contrary. 
但如果有一位值得爱的上帝，他们就不会得出这样的结论，而是恰恰相反。
"And this is the conclusion of the wise: ""There is a God, let us therefore not take delight in the creatures.""  Therefore all that incites us to attach ourselves to the creatures is bad; since it prevents us from serving God if we know Him, or from seeking Him if we know Him not. "
这就是智者的结论：“上帝是存在的，所以我们不要以受造物为乐。”因此，所有煽动我们依附于生物的行为都是不好的；因为如果我们认识神，它就会阻止我们事奉神；如果我们不认识神，它就会阻止我们寻求他。
Now we are full of lust. 
现在我们充满了欲望。
Therefore we are full of evil; therefore we ought to hate ourselves and all that excited us to attach ourselves to any other object than God only. 
因此我们充满了邪恶；因此，我们应该憎恨自己，以及所有那些促使我们将自己依附于除上帝之外的任何其他物体的事物。
  480  To make the members happy, they must have one will, and submit it to the body. 
 480 为了使会员幸福，他们必须有一个意志，并将其服从于身体。
  481  The examples of the noble deaths of the Lacedæmonians and others scarce touch us. 
 481 拉栖代梦人和其他人的高贵死亡的例子很少触动我们。
"For what good is it to us? But the example of the death of the martyrs touches us; for they are ""our members."" We have a common tie with them. "
这对我们有什么好处呢？但烈士们牺牲的例子却触动了我们；因为他们是“我们的成员”。我们和他们有共同的纽带。
Their resolution can form ours, not only by example, but because it has perhaps deserved ours. 
他们的决心可以成为我们的决心，不仅是因为他们的榜样，而且因为它也许值得我们做出这样的决定。
There is nothing of this in the examples of the heathen. 
在异教徒的例子中根本没有这样的例子。
We have no tie with them; as we do not become rich by seeing a stranger who is so, but in fact by seeing a father or a husband who is so. 
我们和他们没有任何关系；因为我们并不是因为看到一个如此富有的陌生人而变得富有，而是因为看到一个如此富有的父亲或丈夫。
  482  _Morality._--God having made the heavens and the earth, which do not feel the happiness of their being, He has willed to make beings who should know it, and who should compose a body of thinking members. 
 482_道德._——上帝创造了天地，它们并不能感受到其存在的幸福，他愿意创造那些应该知道这一点的生物，并且应该组成一个由有思想的成员组成的身体。
For our members do not feel the happiness of their union, of their wonderful intelligence, of the care which has been taken to infuse into them minds, and to make them grow and endure. 
因为我们的成员感受不到他们的结合所带来的幸福，感受不到他们奇妙的智慧，感受不到为他们的思想注入力量、使他们成长和忍耐所付出的关怀。
How happy they would be if they saw and felt it! But for this they would need to have intelligence to know it, and good-will to consent to that of the universal soul. 
如果他们看到并感受到这一点，他们会多么高兴！但为此，他们需要有智慧来了解这一点，并有善意来同意普遍灵魂的意愿。
But if, having received intelligence, they employed it to retain nourishment for themselves without allowing it to pass to the other members, they would hate rather than love themselves; their blessedness, as well as their duty, consisting in their consent to the guidance of the whole soul to which they belong, which loves them better than they love themselves. 
但是，如果他们在获得情报后，利用它来为自己保留营养，而不让其传递给其他成员，那么他们就会恨自己而不是爱自己；他们的幸福，以及他们的责任，在于他们同意他们所属的整个灵魂的指导，这个灵魂爱他们胜过爱自己。
  483  To be a member is to have neither life, being, nor movement, except through the spirit of the body, and for the body. 
 483 成为肢体，除非通过身体的灵，并为了身体，否则就没有生命、存在或运动。
 The separate member, seeing no longer the body to which it belongs, has only a perishing and dying existence. 
分离的成员不再看到它所属的身体，只有灭亡和垂死的存在。
Yet it believes it is a whole, and seeing not the body on which it depends, it believes it depends only on self, and desires to make itself both centre and body. 
但它相信自己是一个整体，看不到它所依赖的身体，它相信自己只依赖于自我，并渴望使自己既是中心又是身体。
But not having in itself a principle of life, it only goes astray, and is astonished in the uncertainty of its being; perceiving in fact that it is not a body, and still not seeing that it is a member of a body. 
但它本身并没有生命的原则，它只会误入歧途，并对其存在的不确定性感到惊讶；事实上知觉它不是身体，但仍然看不到它是身体的一部分。
In short, when it comes to know itself, it has returned as it were to its own home, and loves itself only for the body. 
总之，当它认识自己时，它就好像回到了自己的家，只爱自己的身体。
It deplores its past wanderings. 
它对过去的流浪感到遗憾。
 It cannot by its nature love any other thing, except for itself and to subject it to self, because each thing loves itself more than all. 
从本质上来说，它不能爱任何其他事物，除了它自己，并且让它服从自我，因为每一个事物都爱自己胜过爱一切。
But in loving the body, it loves itself, because it only exists in it, by it, and for it. 
但在爱身体的同时，身体也爱自己，因为身体只存在于身体之中、依靠身体、为身体而存在。
_Qui adhæret Deo unus spiritus est._[180]  The body loves the hand; and the hand, if it had a will, should love itself in the same way as it is loved by the soul. 
 _Qui adhæret Deo unusspirus est._[180] 身体爱手；身体爱手；身体爱手；身体爱手；身体爱手；身体爱手。手如果有意志，就应该像爱灵魂一样爱自己。
All love which goes beyond this is unfair. 
一切超出此范围的爱都是不公平的。
 _Adhærens Deo unus spiritus est._ We love ourselves, because we are members of Jesus Christ. 
 _Adhærens Deo unusspirus est._ 我们爱自己，因为我们是耶稣基督的成员。
We love Jesus Christ, because He is the body of which we are members. 
我们爱耶稣基督，因为他是我们所属的身体。
All is one, one is in the other, like the Three Persons. 
一切皆为一，一在另一之中，就像三人一样。
  484  Two laws[181] suffice to rule the whole Christian Republic better than all the laws of statecraft. 
 484 两条法律[181]足以比所有治国法律更好地统治整个基督教共和国。
  485  The true and only virtue, then, is to hate self (for we are hateful on account of lust), and to seek a truly lovable being to love. 
 485 那么，真正而唯一的美德，就是恨自己（因为我们因贪欲而恨），并寻求一个真正可爱的人来爱。
But as we cannot love what is outside ourselves, we must love a being who is in us, and is not ourselves; and that is true of each and all men. 
但是，正如我们无法爱外在的事物一样，我们必须爱我们内心的存在，而不是我们自己。对于每个人来说都是如此。
Now, only the Universal Being is such. 
现在，只有宇宙存在才是这样的。
The kingdom of God is within us;[182] the universal good is within us, is ourselves--and not ourselves. 
神的国就在我们之内；[182] 普遍的善就在我们之内，就是我们自己——而不是我们自己。
  486  The dignity of man in his innocence consisted in using and having dominion over the creatures, but now in separating himself from them, and subjecting himself to them. 
 486 人在天真的时候的尊严在于使用和统治受造物，但现在则在于使自己与受造物分离并服从它们。
  487  Every religion is false, which as to its faith does not worship one God as the origin of everything, and which as to its morality does not love one only God as the object of everything. 
 487 每种宗教都是虚假的，就其信仰而言，它不崇拜独一的神作为一切的起源；就其道德而言，它不爱独一的神作为一切的对象。
  488  ... 
第488章
But it is impossible that God should ever be the end, if He is not the beginning. 
但如果神不是开始，他就不可能是终结。
We lift our eyes on high, but lean upon the sand; and the earth will dissolve, and we shall fall whilst looking at the heavens. 
我们举目高远，却倚沙；大地将会溶解，我们将在仰望天空的同时坠落。
  489  If there is one sole source of everything, there is one sole end of everything; everything through Him, everything for Him. 
 489 如果一切事物只有一个源头，那么一切事物也只有一个目的；一切都通过他，一切都为他。
The true religion, then, must teach us to worship Him only, and to love Him only. 
那么，真正的宗教必须教导我们单单敬拜他，单单爱他。
But as we find ourselves unable to worship what we know not, and to love any other object but ourselves, the religion which instructs us in these duties must instruct us also of this inability, and teach us also the remedies for it. 
但是，当我们发现自己无法崇拜我们不知道的东西，也无法爱除了我们自己之外的任何其他物体时，指导我们履行这些义务的宗教也必须教导我们这种无能力，并教导我们对此的补救措施。
It teaches us that by one man all was lost, and the bond broken between God and us, and that by one man the bond is renewed. 
它告诉我们，一个人就失去了一切，上帝与我们之间的联系被打破，而一个人就重新建立了联系。
 We are born so averse to this love of God, and it is so necessary that we must be born guilty, or God would be unjust. 
我们生来就如此厌恶上帝的爱，因此我们必须生来有罪，否则上帝就会不公正。
  490  Men, not being accustomed to form merit, but only to recompense it where they find it formed, judge of God by themselves. 
490 人们不习惯于形成功绩，而只在发现功绩时予以报答，他们自行判断真主。
  491  The true religion must have as a characteristic the obligation to love God. 
 491 真正的宗教必须以爱上帝的义务为特征。
This is very just, and yet no other religion has commanded this; ours has done so. 
这是非常公正的，但没有其他宗教有这样的命令。我们已经这样做了。
It must also be aware of human lust and weakness; ours is so. 
它还必须意识到人类的欲望和弱点；我们的就是这样。
It must have adduced remedies for this; one is prayer. 
它一定已经为此提出了补救措施；一是祈祷。
No other religion has asked of God to love and follow Him. 
没有其他宗教要求上帝爱他并跟随他。
  492  He who hates not in himself his self-love, and that instinct which leads him to make himself God, is indeed blinded. 
 492 凡不憎恨自己的自爱，以及引导他自称为神的本能的人，确实是盲目的。
Who does not see that there is nothing so opposed to justice and truth? For it is false that we deserve this, and it is unfair and impossible to attain it, since all demand the same thing. 
谁看不出没有什么比正义和真理更悖逆的了？因为认为我们应得的这一点是错误的，而且这是不公平的，也是不可能实现的，因为所有人都要求同样的东西。
It is, then, a manifest injustice which is innate in us, of which we cannot get rid, and of which we must get rid. 
因此，这是我们与生俱来的一种明显的不公正，我们无法摆脱它，但我们必须摆脱它。
 Yet no religion has indicated that this was a sin; or that we were born in it; or that we were obliged to resist it; or has thought of giving us remedies for it. 
然而，没有任何宗教表明这是一种罪过。或者我们出生于其中；或者说我们有义务抵制它；或者考虑给我们补救措施。
  493  The true religion teaches our duties; our weaknesses, pride, and lust; and the remedies, humility and mortification. 
第493章 真正的宗教教导我们的责任；我们的弱点、骄傲和欲望；以及补救措施、谦卑和羞辱。
  494  The true religion must teach greatness and misery; must lead to the esteem and contempt of self, to love and to hate. 
第494章 真正的宗教必须教导伟大和苦难；必然导致对自我的尊重和蔑视，爱和恨。
  495  If it is an extraordinary blindness to live without investigating what we are, it is a terrible one to live an evil life, while believing in God. 
 495 如果说不探究自己的本质而生活是一种非凡的盲目，那么在信仰上帝的同时过着邪恶的生活则是一种可怕的生活。
  496  Experience makes us see an enormous difference between piety and goodness. 
 496 经验让我们看到虔诚与善良之间的巨大差异。
  497  _Against those who, trusting to the mercy of God, live heedlessly, without doing good works._--As the two sources of our sins are pride and sloth, God has revealed to us two of His attributes to cure them, mercy and justice. 
 497_反对那些信赖上帝的怜悯，生活鲁莽，不做善事的人。_--由于我们罪孽的两个根源是骄傲和懒惰，上帝向我们揭示了他的两个属性来治愈它们：怜悯和懒惰。正义。
"The property of justice is to humble pride, however holy may be our works, _et non intres in judicium_,[183] etc.; and the property of mercy is to combat sloth by exhorting to good works, according to that passage: ""The goodness of God leadeth to repentance,""[184] and that other of the Ninevites: ""Let us do penance to see if peradventure He will pity us.""[185] And thus mercy is so far from authorising slackness, that it is on the contrary the quality which formally attacks it; so that instead of saying, ""If there were no mercy in God we should have to make every kind of effort after virtue,"" we must say, on the contrary, that it is because there is mercy in God, that we must make every kind of effort. "
正义的属性是谦虚的骄傲，无论我们的作品多么神圣，_et non intres in judicium_，[183]等等；怜悯的本质是通过劝人行善来对抗懒惰，根据那段话：“上帝的良善导致悔改”，[184]而另一个尼尼微人：“让我们忏悔，看看他是否会怜悯我们。”[185]因此，怜悯绝不是批准懈怠，相反，它是正式攻击懒惰的品质；因此，我们不应该说：“如果上帝没有怜悯，我们就必须努力追求美德”，相反，我们必须说，正是因为上帝有怜悯，我们才必须尽一切努力去追求美德。一种努力。
  498  It is true there is difficulty in entering into godliness. 
 498 确实，进入敬虔是有困难的。
But this difficulty does not arise from the religion which begins in us, but from the irreligion which is still there. 
但这种困难并非源于我们内心开始的宗教，而是源于仍然存在的非宗教。
If our senses were not opposed to penitence, and if our corruption were not opposed to the purity of God, there would be nothing in this painful to us. 
如果我们的感官不反对悔罪，如果我们的败坏不反对上帝的纯洁，那么这对我们来说就没有什么痛苦了。
We suffer only in proportion as the vice which is natural to us resists supernatural grace. 
我们所受的苦难只是与我们本性的恶行抗拒超自然恩典的程度成正比。
Our heart feels torn asunder between these opposed efforts. 
在这些相互对立的努力之间，我们的心感到撕裂。
But it would be very unfair to impute this violence to God, who is drawing us on, instead of to the world, which is holding us back. 
但如果把这种暴力归咎于吸引我们的上帝，而不是阻碍我们的世界，那就太不公平了。
It is as a child, which a mother tears from the arms of robbers, in the pain it suffers, should love the loving and legitimate violence of her who procures its liberty, and detest only the impetuous and tyrannical violence of those who detain it unjustly. 
就像母亲从强盗怀里夺走的孩子一样，在痛苦中，她应该热爱为孩子争取自由的充满爱心和合法的暴力，而只厌恶那些不公正地拘留孩子的人的鲁莽和残暴的暴力。 。
The most cruel war which God can make with men in this life is to leave them without that war which He came to bring. 
神在今生所能与人类进行的最残酷的战争，就是让他们不再受到他带来的战争的影响。
"I came to send war,[186] He says, ""and to teach them of this war. "
我来是为了发动战争，[186]他说，“并教导他们这场战争。
"I came to bring fire and the sword.""[187] Before Him the world lived in this false peace. "
我来带来火与剑。”[187] 在他之前，世界生活在这种虚假的和平之中。
  499  _External works._--There is nothing so perilous as what pleases God and man. 
 499_外部工程。_--没有什么比取悦神和人的事更危险的了。
For those states, which please God and man, have one property which pleases God, and another which pleases men; as the greatness of Saint Teresa. 
因为那些令上帝和人类喜悦的国家，拥有一种令上帝喜悦的财产，和另一种令人类喜悦的财产。就像圣特蕾莎的伟大一样。
What pleased God was her deep humility in the midst of her revelations; what pleased men was her light. 
令上帝喜悦的是她在启示中表现出的深深的谦卑。令男人高兴的是她的光芒。
And so we torment ourselves to imitate her discourses, thinking to imitate her conditions, and not so much to love what God loves, and to put ourselves in the state which God loves. 
于是我们就折磨自己去模仿她的话语，想着去模仿她的处境，而不是去爱神所爱的，把自己置于神所爱的境地。
 It is better not to fast, and thereby humbled, than to fast and be self-satisfied therewith. 
最好不要禁食，从而感到谦卑，而不是禁食并因此而沾沾自喜。
The Pharisee and the Publican.[188]  What use will memory be to me, if it can alike hurt and help me, and all depends upon the blessing of God, who gives only to things done for Him, according to His rules and in His ways, the manner being as important as the thing, and perhaps more; since God can bring forth good out of evil, and without God we bring forth evil out of good?   500  The meaning of the words, good and evil. 
法利赛人和税吏。[188]记忆对我来说有什么用处，如果它既能伤害我，又能帮助我，一切都取决于上帝的祝福，上帝只给予为他所做的事情，按照他的规则和方式，方式与事情，或许还有更多；既然神能从恶中生出善来，没有神，我们就从善中生出恶来？ 500 善恶之词的意义。
  501  First step: to be blamed for doing evil, and praised for doing good. 
 501第一步：作恶受责，行善受赞。
 Second step: to be neither praised, nor blamed. 
第二步：不被赞扬，也不被指责。
  502  Abraham[189] took nothing for himself, but only for his servants. 
 502 亚伯拉罕[189]没有为自己谋取任何东西，只为他的仆人谋取利益。
"So the righteous man takes for himself nothing of the world, nor the applause of the world, but only for his passions, which he uses as their master, saying to the one, ""Go,"" and to another, ""Come."" _Sub te erit appetitus tuus._[190] The passions thus subdued are virtues. "
因此，义人不为自己夺取世上的任何东西，也不为世人的喝彩，而只为他的激情，他用它作为激情的主人，对一个人说“走”，对另一个人说“来”。 _Sub te erit appetitus tuus._[190] 这样抑制的激情就是美德。
Even God attributes to Himself avarice, jealousy, anger; and these are virtues as well as kindness, pity, constancy, which are also passions. 
甚至上帝也将贪婪、嫉妒、愤怒归因于自己；这些都是美德，还有仁慈、怜悯、坚贞，这些也是激情。
We must employ them as slaves, and, leaving to them their food, prevent the soul from taking any of it. 
我们必须雇用他们作为奴隶，并把食物留给他们，防止灵魂夺走任何食物。
For, when the passions become masters, they are vices; and they give their nutriment to the soul, and the soul nourishes itself upon it, and is poisoned. 
因为，当情欲成为主宰时，它们就是恶习；当情欲成为主宰时，它们就是恶习。它们给灵魂提供营养，灵魂靠它来滋养自己，并被毒害。
  503  Philosophers have consecrated the vices by placing them in God Himself. 
 503 哲学家们将罪恶神圣化，将其置于上帝本身之中。
Christians have consecrated the virtues. 
基督徒已经奉献了美德。
  504  The just man acts by faith in the least things; when he reproves his servants, he desires their conversion by the Spirit of God, and prays God to correct them; and he expects as much from God as from his own reproofs, and prays God to bless his corrections. 
 504 义人在最小的事情上都以信心行事；当他责备仆人时，他希望他们借着神的灵悔改，并祈求神纠正他们。他对上帝的期望与对他自己的责备的期望一样多，并祈求上帝保佑他的纠正。
And so in all his other actions he proceeds with the Spirit of God; and his actions deceive us by reason of the ... 
因此，在他所有其他的行动中，他都是按照上帝的灵行事的。他的行为欺骗了我们，因为......
or suspension of the Spirit of God in him; and he repents in his affliction. 
或神的灵悬浮在他里面；他在苦难中悔改。
  505  All things can be deadly to us, even the things made to serve us; as in nature walls can kill us, and stairs can kill us, if we do not walk circumspectly. 
 505 一切事物对我们来说都可能是致命的，即使是为我们服务的事物；就像在大自然中一样，如果我们不小心行走，墙壁会杀死我们，楼梯也会杀死我们。
 The least movement affects all nature; the entire sea changes because of a rock. 
最小的运动影响整个自然；整个大海因为一块岩石而改变。
Thus in grace, the least action affects everything by its consequences; therefore everything is important. 
因此，在恩典中，最微小的行动都会以其后果影响一切。因此一切都很重要。
 In each action we must look beyond the action at our past, present, and future state, and at others whom it affects, and see the relations of all those things. 
在每一个行动中，我们都必须超越该行动，着眼于我们过去、现在和未来的状态，以及它所影响的其他人，并看到所有这些事物之间的关系。
And then we shall be very cautious. 
然后我们会非常谨慎。
  506  Let God not impute to us our sins, that is to say, all the consequences and results of our sins, which are dreadful, even those of the smallest faults, if we wish to follow them out mercilessly!   507  The spirit of grace; the hardness of the heart; external circumstances. 
 506愿神不要将我们的罪归咎于我们，也就是说，如果我们想无情地追随我们的罪，那么，即使是最小的过错，也是可怕的，所有的后果和果报！ 507 恩典之灵；心的刚硬；外部环境。
  508  Grace is indeed needed to turn a man into a saint; and he who doubts it does not know what a saint or a man is. 
508 一个人成为圣人确实需要恩典；怀疑这一点的人不知道什么是圣人或人。
  509  _Philosophers._--A fine thing to cry to a man who does not know himself, that he should come of himself to God! And a fine thing to say so to a man who does know himself!   510  Man is not worthy of God, but he is not incapable of being made worthy. 
 509_哲学家_--向一个不认识自己的人呼喊，他应该凭自己来到上帝面前，这是一件好事！对一个真正了解自己的人说这样的话真是太好了！ 510 人不配配上帝，但他并非不能配配上帝。
 It is unworthy of God to unite Himself to wretched man; but it is not unworthy of God to pull him out of his misery. 
上帝不配与可怜的人联合；但上帝把他从痛苦中拉出来并不是不值得的。
  511  If we would say that man is too insignificant to deserve communion with God, we must indeed be very great to judge of it. 
 511 如果我们说人太渺小，不值得与上帝相交，那么我们确实必须非常伟大才能做出判断。
  512  It is, in peculiar phraseology, wholly the body of Jesus Christ, but it cannot be said to be the whole body of Jesus Christ.[191] The union of two things without change does not enable us to say that one becomes the other; the soul thus being united to the body, the fire to the timber, without change. 
 512 用特殊的说法来说，它完全是耶稣基督的身体，但不能说是耶稣基督的整个身体。 [191]两种事物不发生变化的结合并不能使我们说一个事物成为另一个事物；相反，我们不能说一个事物变成了另一个事物。灵魂就这样与身体结合在一起，火与木头结合在一起，没有任何变化。
But change is necessary to make the form of the one become the form of the other; thus the union of the Word to man. 
但要使一种形式成为另一种形式，就必须进行改变；因此，道与人的结合。
Because my body without my soul would not make the body of a man; therefore my soul united to any matter whatsoever will make my body. 
因为如果没有灵魂，我的身体就不能成为一个人的身体；因此，我的灵魂与任何物质结合就会构成我的身体。
It does not distinguish the necessary condition from the sufficient condition; the union is necessary, but not sufficient. 
它不区分必要条件和充分条件；联盟是必要的，但还不够。
The left arm is not the right. 
左臂不是右臂。
 Impenetrability is a property of matter. 
不可穿透性是物质的一种特性。
 Identity _de numers_ in regard to the same time requires the identity of matter. 
数字的同一性同时要求物质的同一性。
 Thus if God united my soul to a body in China, the same body, _idem numero_, would be in China. 
因此，如果上帝将我的灵魂与中国的身体结合起来，那么同一个身体，_idem numero_，也会在中国。
 The same river which runs there is _idem numero_ as that which runs at the same time in China. 
流经那里的河流与同时流经中国的河流是同一条河流。
  513  Why God has established prayer. 
第513章 神为何设立祷告。
1
1
To communicate to His creatures the dignity of causality. 
向他的创造物传达因果关系的尊严。
2
2
To teach us from whom our virtue comes. 
教导我们我们的美德来自于谁。
3
3
To make us deserve other virtues by work. 
让我们通过工作获得其他美德。
 (But to keep His own pre-eminence, He grants prayer to whom He pleases.)  Objection: But we believe that we hold prayer of ourselves. 
（但为了保持自己的卓越地位，他将祷告赐予他所愿意的人。） 反对意见：但我们相信我们有自己的祷告。
 This is absurd; for since, though having faith, we cannot have virtues, how should we have faith? Is there a greater distance between infidelity and faith than between faith and virtue?  _Merit._ This word is ambiguous. 
这是荒谬的；既然我们虽然有信仰，却不能有德行，那么我们该如何有信仰呢？不忠和信仰之间的距离是否比信仰和美德之间的距离更大？ _优点._ 这个词含糊不清。
 _Meruit habere Redemptorem. 
 _Meruit habere Redemptorem。
 Meruit tam sacra membra tangere.

 Digno tam sacra membra tangere. 
 Digno tam sacra membra tangere。
 Non sum dignus.[192]  Qui manducat indignus[193]  Dignus est accipere.[194]  Dignare me._  God is only bound according to His promises. 
并非如此。[192] Qui manducat indignus[193] Dignus est accipere.[194]请恕我直言。_上帝只受他的应许约束。
He has promised to grant justice to prayers; He has never promised prayer only to the children of promise. 
他承诺将公正地对待祈祷；他从来没有应许只向应许之子祷告。
 Saint Augustine has distinctly said that strength would be taken away from the righteous. 
圣奥古斯丁明确表示，正义者的力量将会被剥夺。
But it is by chance that he said it; for it might have happened that the occasion of saying it did not present itself. 
但他说这句话纯属偶然；因为说这话的时机可能并没有出现。
But his principles make us see that when the occasion for it presented itself, it was impossible that he should not say it, or that he should say anything to the contrary. 
但他的原则让我们看到，当需要的时候，他不可能不说，也不可能说相反的话。
It is then rather that he was forced to say it, when the occasion presented itself, than that he said it, when the occasion presented itself, the one being of necessity, the other of chance. 
与其说他是在情况出现时被迫说出来的，不如说是他在情况出现时才说出来的，一个是必然的，另一个是偶然的。
But the two are all that we can ask. 
但我们能问的就只有这两个了。
"  514  The elect will be ignorant of their virtues, and the outcast of the greatness of their sins: ""Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered, thirsty?"" etc.[195][196]   515  Romans iii, 27. "
 514 选民将不知道他们的美德，而被抛弃的人将不知道他们的严重罪恶：“主啊，我们什么时候看见你又饿又渴？”等等[195][196] 515 罗马书三，27。
Boasting is excluded. 
夸耀是排除在外的。
By what law? Of works? nay, but by faith. 
依据什么法律？作品？不，而是凭着信心。
Then faith is not within our power like the deeds of the law, and it is given to us in another way. 
那么信心就不像律法的行为那样在我们的能力范围之内，而是以另一种方式赐给我们的。
  516  Comfort yourselves. 
第516章 安慰一下吧。
It is not from yourselves that you should expect grace; but, on the contrary, it is in expecting nothing from yourselves, that you must hope for it. 
你们不应该期待恩典来自你们自己，而是来自你们自己。但恰恰相反，正是在对自己不抱任何期望的情况下，你们才必须抱有希望。
  517  Every condition, and even the martyrs, have to fear, according to Scripture. 
517 根据圣经，每一种情况，甚至殉道者，都必须害怕。
 The greatest pain of purgatory is the uncertainty of the judgment. 
炼狱最大的痛苦就是判断的不确定性。
_Deus absconditus._   518  John viii. 
 _潜逃的神。_ 518 约翰八世。
_Multi crediderunt in eum. 
 _eum 中的多重信用。
"Dicebat ergo Jesus: ""Si manseritis_ ... "
 Dicebat ergo Jesus：“Si manseritis_ ...
"VERE _mei discipuli eritis, et_ VERITAS LIBERABIT VOS."" _Responderunt: ""Semen Abrahæ sumus, et nemini servimus unquam.""_  There is a great difference between disciples and true disciples. "
 VERE _mei discipuli eritis，et_ VERITAS LIBERABIT VOS。”_Responderunt：“Semen Abrahæ sumus，et nemini servimus unquam。”_门徒和真正的门徒之间有很大的区别。
We recognise them by telling them that the truth will make them free; for if they answer that they are free, and that it is in their power to come out of slavery to the devil, they are indeed disciples, but not true disciples. 
我们通过告诉他们真相将使他们自由来认识他们；因为如果他们回答说他们是自由的，并且他们有能力摆脱魔鬼的奴役，那么他们确实是门徒，但不是真正的门徒。
  519  The law has not destroyed nature, but has instructed it; grace has not destroyed the law, but has made it act. 
 519 法律并没有毁灭自然，而是指导了自然；恩典并没有摧毁律法，而是使它发挥作用。
Faith received at baptism is the source of the whole life of Christians and of the converted. 
受洗时获得的信仰是基督徒和归信者整个生活的源泉。
  520  Grace will always be in the world, and nature also; so that the former is in some sort natural. 
第520章 恩典常在世间，自然亦然；所以前者在某种程度上是自然的。
And thus there will always be Pelagians, and always Catholics, and always strife; because the first birth makes the one, and the grace of the second birth the other. 
因此，总会有伯拉纠派，总会有天主教徒，总会有冲突。因为第一次的出生创造了一个，而第二次出生的恩典则创造了另一个。
  521  The law imposed what it did not give. 
 521 法律强加了它没有给予的东西。
Grace gives what is imposes. 
恩典给予所强加的东西。
  522  All faith consists in Jesus Christ and in Adam, and all morality in lust and in grace. 
 522 所有的信仰都在于耶稣基督和亚当，所有的道德都在于情欲和恩典。
  523  There is no doctrine more appropriate to man than this, which teaches him his double capacity of receiving and of losing grace, because of the double peril to which he is exposed, of despair or of pride. 
 523 没有比这更适合人的教义了，它教导人接受和失去恩典的双重能力，因为他面临着绝望或骄傲的双重危险。
  524  The philosophers did not prescribe feelings suitable to the two states. 
 524 哲学家们没有规定适合这两种状态的感情。
 They inspired feelings of pure greatness, and that is not man's state. 
它们激发了纯粹伟大的感觉，而那不是人类的状态。
 They inspired feelings of pure littleness, and that is not man's state. 
它们激发了纯粹的渺小感，而那不是人类的状态。
 There must be feelings of humility, not from nature, but from penitence, not to rest in them, but to go on to greatness. 
必须有谦卑的感觉，不是来自自然，而是来自悔罪，不是安于其中，而是继续走向伟大。
There must be feelings of greatness, not from merit, but from grace, and after having passed through humiliation. 
必须有伟大的感觉，不是来自功绩，而是来自恩典，并且是在经历了屈辱之后。
  525  Misery induces despair, pride induces presumption. 
 525 苦难导致绝望，骄傲导致狂妄。
The Incarnation shows man the greatness of his misery by the greatness of the remedy which he required. 
道成肉身通过人类所需要的伟大补救措施向人类展示了他的痛苦的严重性。
  526  The knowledge of God without that of man's misery causes pride. 
 526 认识上帝而不认识人的苦难会引起骄傲。
The knowledge of man's misery without that of God causes despair. 
只知道人类的苦难而不了解上帝会导致绝望。
The knowledge of Jesus Christ constitutes the middle course, because in Him we find both God and our misery. 
对耶稣基督的认识构成了中间路线，因为在他身上我们既找到了上帝，也找到了我们的痛苦。
  527  Jesus Christ is a God whom we approach without pride, and before whom we humble ourselves without despair. 
 527 耶稣基督是我们毫无骄傲地接近的神，我们在他面前谦卑自己而不绝望。
  528  ... 
 528 ...
Not a degradation which renders us incapable of good, nor a holiness exempt from evil. 
不是一种使我们无法行善的堕落，也不是一种免于邪恶的圣洁。
  529  A person told me one day that on coming from confession he felt great joy and confidence. 
529 有一天，一个人告诉我，忏悔结束后，他感到极大的喜悦和信心。
Another told me that he remained in fear. 
另一个人告诉我，他仍然处于恐惧之中。
Whereupon I thought that these two together would make one good man, and that each was wanting in that he had not the feeling of the other. 
于是我想，这两个人在一起会成为一个好人，而且每个人都缺乏对方的感觉。
The same often happens in other things. 
同样的情况也经常发生在其他事情上。
  530  He who knows the will of his master will be beaten with more blows, because of the power he has by his knowledge. 
 530 知道主人意愿的人，会受到更多的打击，因为他的知识所具有的力量。
_Qui justus est, justificetur adhuc_,[197] because of the power he has by justice. 
 _Qui justus est, justificetur adhuc_,[197] 因为他通过正义拥有权力。
From him who has received most, will the greatest reckoning be demanded, because of the power he has by this help. 
接受最多的人会被要求最大的清算，因为他通过这种帮助而拥有力量。
  531  Scripture has provided passages of consolation and of warning for all conditions. 
 531 圣经为所有情况提供了安慰和警告的段落。
 Nature seems to have done the same thing by her two infinities, natural and moral; for we shall always have the higher and the lower, the more clever and the less clever, the most exalted and the meanest, in order to humble our pride, and exalt our humility. 
大自然似乎也通过她的自然无限和道德无限做了同样的事情。因为我们总会有较高级的和较低级的、较聪明的和较不聪明的、最崇高的和最卑微的，以便降低我们的骄傲，提高我们的谦卑。
  532  _Comminutum cor_ (Saint Paul). 
第532章 _Comminutum cor_（圣保罗）。
This is the Christian character. 
这就是基督徒的品格。
_Alba has named you, I know you no more_ (Corneille).[198] That is the inhuman character. 
 _阿尔巴已经命名了你，我不再认识你了_（高乃依）。[198]这就是非人性。
The human character is the opposite. 
人的性格则恰恰相反。
  533  There are only two kinds of men: the righteous who believe themselves sinners; the rest, sinners, who believe themselves righteous. 
 533 世上只有两种人：自认为是罪人的义人；其余的都是罪人，他们相信自己是正义的。
  534  We owe a great debt to those who point out faults. 
 534 我们非常感谢那些指出错误的人。
For they mortify us. 
因为他们让我们感到羞耻。
They teach us that we have been despised. 
他们告诉我们，我们被鄙视了。
They do not prevent our being so in the future; for we have many other faults for which we may be despised. 
它们并不妨碍我们将来成为这样的人；因为我们还有许多其他的缺点，可能会因此而受到轻视。
They prepare for us the exercise of correction and freedom from fault. 
它们为我们准备了改正和免于过错的练习。
  535  Man is so made that by continually telling him he is a fool he believes it, and by continually telling it to himself he makes himself believe it. 
535 人就是这样被造的，只要不断地告诉他他是个傻瓜，他就会相信这一点；不断地告诉自己，他就会让自己相信这一点。
For man holds an inward talk with his self alone, which it behoves him to regulate well: _Corrumpunt bonos mores colloquia prava_.[199] We must keep silent as much as possible and talk with ourselves only of God, whom we know to be true; and thus we convince ourselves of the truth. 
因为人只与自己进行内心对话，他应该很好地调节这种对话：_Corrumpunt bonos mores colloquia prava_。 [199]我们必须尽可能保持沉默，只与自己谈论上帝，因为我们知道上帝是真实的。这样我们就相信了事实。
  536  Christianity is strange. 
 536 基督教很奇怪。
It bids man recognise that he is vile, even abominable, and bids him desire to be like God. 
它要求人认识到自己是卑鄙的，甚至可憎的，并要求他渴望像上帝一样。
Without such a counterpoise, this dignity would make him horribly vain, or this humiliation would make him terribly abject. 
如果没有这样的平衡，这种尊严就会让他变得无比虚荣，或者这种屈辱就会让他变得无比卑微。
  537  With how little pride does a Christian believe himself united to God! With how little humiliation does he place himself on a level with the worms of earth!  A glorious manner to welcome life and death, good and evil!   538  What difference in point of obedience is there between a soldier and a Carthusian monk? For both are equally under obedience and dependent, both engaged in equally painful exercises. 
537 基督徒相信自己与上帝联合是多么不骄傲啊！他毫不羞辱地把自己与地上的蠕虫放在同一水平上！以光荣的姿态迎接生与死、善与恶！第538章因为两者都同样服从和依赖，都从事同样痛苦的练习。
But the soldier always hopes to command, and never attains this, for even captains and princes are ever slaves and dependants; still he ever hopes and ever works to attain this. 
但士兵总是希望指挥，但永远达不到这一目标，因为即使是首领和王子也永远是奴隶和附庸；他仍然希望并努力实现这一目标。
Whereas the Carthusian monk makes a vow to be always dependent. 
而迦太基修道士则发誓要永远依赖他人。
So they do not differ in their perpetual thraldom, in which both of them always exist, but in the hope, which one always has, and the other never. 
因此，他们的不同之处并不在于永久的奴役，他们都永远存在于其中，而在于希望，一个永远拥有，而另一个则永远不存在。
  539  The hope which Christians have of possessing an infinite good is mingled with real enjoyment as well as with fear; for it is not as with those who should hope for a kingdom, of which they, being subjects, would have nothing; but they hope for holiness, for freedom from injustice, and they have something of this. 
539 基督徒对拥有无限良善的希望与真正的享受和恐惧交织在一起；因为这与那些希望拥有王国的人不同，他们作为臣民，却一无所有。但他们希望圣洁，希望免于不公正，而他们也有这样的东西。
  540  None is so happy as a true Christian, nor so reasonable, virtuous, or amiable. 
 540 没有人比真正的基督徒更幸福，也没有人比真正的基督徒更通情达理、有道德、和蔼可亲。
  541  The Christian religion alone makes man altogether _lovable and happy_. 
 541 只有基督教才使人完全“可爱和快乐”。
In honesty, we cannot perhaps be altogether lovable and happy. 
老实说，我们也许不可能完全可爱和幸福。
  542  _Preface._--The metaphysical proofs of God are so remote from the reasoning of men, and so complicated, that they make little impression; and if they should be of service to some, it would be only during the moment that they see such demonstration; but an hour afterwards they fear they have been mistaken. 
 542 _序言._-上帝的形而上学证据与人类的推理如此遥远，而且如此复杂，以致于没有给人留下深刻的印象；如果他们应该为某些人提供服务，那也只是在他们看到这种示威的那一刻；但一小时后，他们担心自己弄错了。
 _Quod curiositate cognoverunt superbia amiserunt._[200]  This is the result of the knowledge of God obtained without Jesus Christ; it is communion without a mediator with the God whom they have known without a mediator. 
_Quod curiositate cognoverunt superbia amiserunt._[200] 这是在没有耶稣基督的情况下获得上帝知识的结果；这是在没有中保的情况下与他们在没有中保的情况下所认识的上帝的交通。
Whereas those who have known God by a mediator know their own wretchedness. 
而那些通过中保认识上帝的人则知道自己的不幸。
  543  The God of the Christians is a God who makes the soul feel that He is her only good, that her only rest is in Him, that her only delight is in loving Him; and who makes her at the same time abhor the obstacles which keep her back, and prevent her from loving God with all her strength. 
 543基督徒的神是一位使灵魂感到他是她唯一的良善，她唯一的安息在他里面，她唯一的喜乐就是爱他的神；同时又使她憎恶那些阻碍她前进、阻止她全力爱上帝的障碍。
Self-love and lust, which hinder us, are unbearable to her. 
自爱和情欲这些阻碍我们的东西，对她来说是难以忍受的。
Thus God makes her feel that she has this root of self-love which destroys her, and which He alone can cure. 
因此，上帝让她觉得她有这种自爱的根源，它摧毁了她，只有上帝才能治愈它。
  544  Jesus Christ did nothing but teach men that they loved themselves, that they were slaves, blind, sick, wretched, and sinners; that He must deliver them, enlighten, bless, and heal them; that this would be effected by hating self, and by following Him through suffering and the death on the cross. 
544 耶稣基督什么也没做，只是教导人们爱自己，他们是奴隶、盲人、病人、可怜人和罪人；他必须拯救他们、启发他们、祝福他们、医治他们；这可以通过憎恨自我并跟随他经历苦难和十字架上的死亡来实现。
  545  Without Jesus Christ man must be in vice and misery; with Jesus Christ man is free from vice and misery; in Him is all our virtue and all our happiness. 
 545 没有耶稣基督，人就必定处于罪恶和痛苦之中；有了耶稣基督，人就摆脱了罪恶和苦难；我们所有的美德和幸福都在他里面。
Apart from Him there is but vice, misery, darkness, death, despair. 
离开了他，就只有邪恶、痛苦、黑暗、死亡、绝望。
  546  We know God only by Jesus Christ. 
 546 我们只能通过耶稣基督认识上帝。
Without this mediator all communion with God is taken away; through Jesus Christ we know God. 
没有这个中保，与神的一切交通都被剥夺了。通过耶稣基督我们认识神。
All those who have claimed to know God, and to prove Him without Jesus Christ, have had only weak proofs. 
所有那些声称认识上帝并在没有耶稣基督的情况下证明上帝的人都只有微弱的证据。
But in proof of Jesus Christ we have the prophecies, which are solid and palpable proofs. 
但在耶稣基督的证据中，我们有预言，它们是坚实而明显的证据。
And these prophecies, being accomplished and proved true by the event, mark the certainty of these truths, and therefore the divinity of Christ. 
这些预言被事件所实现并被证明是真实的，标志着这些真理的确定性，因此也标志着基督的神性。
In Him then, and through Him, we know God. 
那么，在他里面，并通过他，我们认识神。
Apart from Him, and without the Scripture, without original sin, without a necessary Mediator promised and come, we cannot absolutely prove God, nor teach right doctrine and right morality. 
离开了他，没有圣经，没有原罪，没有应许并到来的必要中保，我们就不能绝对证明神，也不能教导正确的教义和正确的道德。
But through Jesus Christ, and in Jesus Christ, we prove God, and teach morality and doctrine. 
但通过耶稣基督，在耶稣基督里，我们证明上帝，并教导道德和教义。
Jesus Christ is then the true God of men. 
那么耶稣基督就是人类的真神。
 But we know at the same time our wretchedness; for this God is none other than the Saviour of our wretchedness. 
但我们同时也知道自己的不幸；因为这位上帝正是我们苦难的救世主。
So we can only know God well by knowing our iniquities. 
因此，我们只有认识自己的罪孽才能更好地认识神。
Therefore those who have known God, without knowing their wretchedness, have not glorified Him, but have glorified themselves. 
因此，那些认识神的人，却不知道自己的不幸，并不是荣耀了神，而是荣耀了自己。

placuit Deo per stultitiam prædicationis salvos facere._[201]   547  Not only do we know God by Jesus Christ alone, but we know ourselves only by Jesus Christ. 
placuit Deo per stultitiam præminationis salvos facere._[201] 547 我们不仅仅通过耶稣基督认识上帝，而且我们也仅通过耶稣基督认识自己。
We know life and death only through Jesus Christ. 
我们只有通过耶稣基督才能知道生与死。
Apart from Jesus Christ, we do not know what is our life, nor our death, nor God, nor ourselves. 
离开了耶稣基督，我们不知道什么是我们的生命，我们的死亡，什么是上帝，什么是我们自己。
 Thus without the Scripture, which has Jesus Christ alone for its object, we know nothing, and see only darkness and confusion in the nature of God, and in our own nature. 
因此，如果没有以耶稣基督为对象的圣经，我们就一无所知，只能看到神的本性和我们自己的本性中的黑暗和混乱。
  548  It is not only impossible but useless to know God without Jesus Christ. 
 548 没有耶稣基督，认识神不仅不可能，而且毫无用处。
They have not departed from Him, but approached; they have not humbled themselves, but ... 
他们并没有离开他，而是接近他；他们并没有自卑，但是……
 _Quo quisque optimus est, pessimus, si hoc ipsum, quod optimus est, adscribat sibi._   549  I love poverty because He loved it. 
 _Quo quisque optimus est, pessimus, si hoc ipsum, quod optimus est, adscribat sibi._ 549 我爱贫穷，因为他爱它。
I love riches because they afford me the means of helping the very poor. 
我热爱财富，因为它们为我提供了帮助穷人的手段。
I keep faith with everybody; I do not render evil to those who wrong me, but I wish them a lot like mine, in which I receive neither evil nor good from men. 
我对每个人都保持信心；我不会以恶待那些伤害我的人，但我希望他们像我一样，既不接受来自人的恶，也不接受人的善。
I try to be just, true, sincere, and faithful to all men; I have a tender heart for those to whom God has more closely united me; and whether I am alone, or seen of men, I do all my actions in the sight of God, who must judge of them, and to whom I have consecrated them all. 
我努力对所有人公正、真实、真诚和忠诚；对于那些与上帝更加紧密地联系在一起的人，我怀有一颗温柔的心；无论我是独自一人，还是被人看见，我所做的一切都是在上帝面前进行的，上帝必须审判我的行为，我已将它们全部奉献给上帝。
 These are my sentiments; and every day of my life I bless my Redeemer, who has implanted them in me, and who, of a man full of weakness, of miseries, of lust, of pride, and of ambition, has made a man free from all these evils by the power of His grace, to which all the glory of it is due, as of myself I have only misery and error. 
这些是我的感想；在我生命中的每一天，我都祝福我的救赎主，他把这些根植于我的内心，他使一个充满软弱、痛苦、欲望、骄傲和野心的人摆脱了所有这些邪恶。靠着他恩典的力量，所有的荣耀都归功于他，而我自己却只有痛苦和错误。
  550  _Dignior plagis quam osculis non timeo quia amo._   551  _The Sepulchre of Jesus Christ._--Jesus Christ was dead, but seen on the Cross. 
 550 _Dignor plagis quam osculis non timeo quia amo._ 551 _耶稣基督的坟墓。_--耶稣基督死了，但在十字架上可见。
He was dead, and hidden in the Sepulchre. 
他死了，藏在坟墓里。
 Jesus Christ was buried by the saints alone. 
耶稣基督被圣徒独自埋葬。
 Jesus Christ wrought no miracle at the Sepulchre. 
耶稣基督没有在坟墓上创造奇迹。
 Only the saints entered it. 
只有圣人才能进入其中。
 It is there, not on the Cross, that Jesus Christ takes a new life. 
耶稣基督就是在那里，而不是在十字架上，获得了新的生命。
 It is the last mystery of the Passion and the Redemption. 
这是受难与救赎的最后一个奥秘。
 Jesus Christ had nowhere to rest on earth but in the Sepulchre. 
耶稣基督在地上除了坟墓之外没有其他地方可以安息。
 His enemies only ceased to persecute Him at the Sepulchre. 
他的敌人只是停止在坟墓里迫害他。
  552  _The Mystery of Jesus._--Jesus suffers in His passions the torments which men inflict upon Him; but in His agony He suffers the torments which He inflicts on Himself; _turbare semetipsum_.[202] This is a suffering from no human, but an almighty hand, for He must be almighty to bear it. 
 552_耶稣的奥秘。_——耶稣在他的激情中承受着人们加诸在他身上的折磨；但在他的痛苦中，他承受着他给自己带来的折磨。 _turbare semetipsum_。[202]这不是来自人的痛苦，而是来自全能之手的痛苦，因为他必须是全能的才能承受它。
 Jesus seeks some comfort at least in His three dearest friends, and they are asleep. 
耶稣至少在他最亲爱的三个朋友身上寻求一些安慰，而他们已经睡着了。
He prays them to bear with Him for a little, and they leave Him with entire indifference, having so little compassion that it could not prevent their sleeping even for a moment. 
祂祈求他们稍微忍耐一下，但他们却完全漠不关心地离开了祂，几乎没有怜悯之心，以至于无法阻止他们片刻的睡眠。
And thus Jesus was left alone to the wrath of God. 
就这样，耶稣独自一人承受上帝的愤怒。
 Jesus is alone on the earth, without any one not only to feel and share His suffering, but even to know of it; He and Heaven were alone in that knowledge. 
耶稣独自一人在世上，没有人能够感受和分担他的痛苦，甚至没有人知道他的痛苦；只有他和天堂知道这一点。
 Jesus is in a garden, not of delight as the first Adam, where he lost himself and the whole human race, but in one of agony, where He saved Himself and the whole human race. 
耶稣在一个花园里，不像第一个亚当那样快乐，在那里他迷失了自己和整个人类，而是在痛苦之中，在那里他拯救了自己和整个人类。
 He suffers this affliction and this desertion in the horror of night. 
他在恐怖的夜晚承受着这种痛苦和这种遗弃。
 I believe that Jesus never complained but on this single occasion; but then He complained as if he could no longer bear His extreme suffering. 
我相信耶稣从来没有抱怨过，除了这一次；但随后他抱怨说，好像他再也无法忍受他的极度痛苦了。
My soul is sorrowful, even unto death.[203]  Jesus seeks companionship and comfort from men. 
我的灵魂悲伤至死。[203]耶稣寻求人的陪伴和安慰。
This is the sole occasion in all His life, as it seems to me. 
在我看来，这是他一生中唯一的一次。
But He receives it not, for His disciples are asleep. 
但他没有接受，因为他的门徒已经睡着了。
 Jesus will be in agony even to the end of the world. 
耶稣甚至会在痛苦中直到世界末日。
We must not sleep during that time. 
那段时间我们一定不能睡觉。
 Jesus, in the midst of this universal desertion, including that of His own friends chosen to watch with Him, finding them asleep, is vexed because of the danger to which they expose, not Him, but themselves; He cautions them for their own safety and their own good, with a sincere tenderness for them during their ingratitude, and warns them that the spirit is willing and the flesh weak. 
耶稣在这种普遍的离弃之中，包括他自己选择与他一起守望的朋友们，发现他们睡着了，他很烦恼，因为他们暴露的危险不是他，而是他们自己；他为了他们自己的安全和利益而警告他们，在他们忘恩负义时对他们表现出真诚的温柔，并警告他们精神是愿意的，肉体是软弱的。
 Jesus, finding them still asleep, without being restrained by any consideration for themselves or for Him, has the kindness not to waken them, and leaves them in repose. 
耶稣发现他们还在睡觉，没有考虑到他们自己或他，就仁慈地没有叫醒他们，让他们休息。
 Jesus prays, uncertain of the will of His Father, and fears death; but, when He knows it, He goes forward to offer Himself to death. 
耶稣祈祷，不确定天父的旨意，并且害怕死亡；但是，当他知道这一点时，他就会前去献上自己的死亡。
_Eamus. 
 _埃姆斯。

 Jesus asked of men and was not heard. 
耶稣向人求问，却没有人听见。
 Jesus, while His disciples slept, wrought their salvation. 
耶稣在门徒睡觉时拯救了他们。
He has wrought that of each of the righteous while they slept, both in their nothingness before their birth, and in their sins after their birth. 
他在每个义人睡觉时，在他们出生前的虚无中，以及在他们出生后的罪恶中，为他们做了这件事。
 He prays only once that the cup pass away, and then with submission; and twice that it come if necessary. 
他只祈祷一次让杯子消失，然后就顺服了。如果有必要的话，它会来两倍。
 Jesus is weary. 
耶稣很疲倦。
 Jesus, seeing all His friends asleep and all His enemies wakeful, commits Himself entirely to His Father. 
耶稣看到他所有的朋友都睡着了，而他所有的敌人都醒着，他就把自己完全交托给他的天父。
 Jesus does not regard in Judas his enmity, but the order of God, which He loves and admits, since He calls him friend. 
耶稣并不认为犹大是敌意，而是上帝的命令，他爱并承认这一命令，因为他称他为朋友。
 Jesus tears Himself away from His disciples to enter into His agony; we must tear ourselves away from our nearest and dearest to imitate Him. 
耶稣与门徒分离，进入痛苦之中。我们必须远离我们最亲近的人来效法他。
 Jesus being in agony and in the greatest affliction, let us pray longer. 
耶稣正处于痛苦和最大的苦难中，让我们祈祷更长一些。
 We implore the mercy of God, not that He may leave us at peace in our vices, but that He may deliver us from them. 
我们祈求上帝的怜悯，不是求他让我们在罪恶中安然无恙，而是求他将我们从罪恶中拯救出来。
 If God gave us masters by His own hand, oh! how necessary for us to obey them with a good heart! Necessity and events follow infallibly. 
如果上帝亲手赐给我们主人，哦！我们多么需要怀着一颗善良的心去服从他们！必然性和事件必然会随之而来。

" _Eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum._[205] Each one creates his god, when judging, ""This is good or bad""; and men mourn or rejoice too much at events. "
 _Eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum._[205] 每个人在判断“这是好是坏”时都创造了自己的神；人们对事件过度哀悼或高兴。
 Do little things as though they were great, because of the majesty of Jesus Christ who does them in us, and who lives our life; and do the greatest things as though they were little and easy, because of His omnipotence. 
把小事当作大事来做，因为耶稣基督的威严在我们里面做这些事，并且过我们的生活；因为他的全能，所以做最伟大的事情就好像它们是小而容易的一样。
  553  It seems to me that Jesus Christ only allowed His wounds to be touched after His resurrection: _Noli me tangere._[206] We must unite ourselves only to His sufferings. 
 553 在我看来，耶稣基督在复活后只允许触摸他的伤口：_Noli me tangere._[206] 我们必须只与他的苦难联合。
 At the Last Supper He gave Himself in communion as about to die; to the disciples at Emmaus as risen from the dead; to the whole Church as ascended into heaven. 
在最后的晚餐上，他在临死前将自己献祭了。给以马忤斯的门徒，他们从死里复活了；为整个教会升天。
"  554  ""Compare not thyself with others, but with Me. "
 554、“不要与别人比较，而要与我比较。
If thou dost not find Me in those with whom thou comparest thyself, thou comparest thyself to one who is abominable. 
如果你在那些与你相比较的人身上找不到我，那么你就将自己与一个可憎的人相比较了。
If thou findest Me in them, compare thyself to Me. 
如果你在他们身上找到了我，请将你自己与我进行比较。
But whom wilt thou compare? Thyself, or Me in thee? If it is thyself, it is one who is abominable. 
但你会与谁比较呢？你自己，还是你里面的我？如果是你自己，那就是一个可恶的人。
If it is I, thou comparest Me to Myself. 
如果是我，你就把我与我自己相比较。
Now I am God in all. 
现在我是一切之神。
" ""I speak to thee, and often counsel thee, because thy director cannot speak to thee, for I do not want thee to lack a guide. "
“我对你说话，经常给你建议，因为你的导师不能和你说话，因为我不想让你缺乏向导。
" ""And perhaps I do so at his prayers, and thus he leads thee without thy seeing it. "
 “也许我是在他的祈祷下这样做的，因此他在你看不见的情况下引导你。
Thou wouldst not seek Me, if thou didst not possess Me. 
如果你没有拥有我，你就不会寻求我。
" ""Be not therefore troubled.""     SECTION VIII  THE FUNDAMENTALS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION   555  ... "
 “不要因此烦恼。”第八节基督教的基本原理 555 ...
Men blaspheme what they do not know. 
人们亵渎他们不知道的事情。
The Christian religion consists in two points. 
基督教有两点。
It is of equal concern to men to know them, and it is equally dangerous to be ignorant to them. 
人们对了解它们同样关心，对它们无知也同样危险。
And it is equally of God's mercy that He has given indications of both. 
同样出于上帝的仁慈，他对这两件事都给出了指示。
 And yet they take occasion to conclude that one of these points does not exist, from that which should have caused them to infer the other. 
然而，他们有时会根据本应推断出另一点的事实得出结论：其中一点并不存在。
The sages who have said there is only one God have been persecuted, the Jews were hated, and still more the Christians. 
那些声称只有一位上帝的圣人遭到迫害，犹太人被憎恨，基督徒更是如此。
They have seen by the light of nature that if there be a true religion on earth, the course of all things must tend to it as to a centre. 
他们从自然之光中看到，如果地球上存在真正的宗教，那么万物的发展必然以它为中心。
 The whole course of things must have for its object the establishment and the greatness of religion. 
整个事情的发展必然以宗教的建立和宗教的伟大为目标。
Men must have within them feelings suited to what religion teaches us. 
人们内心必须有符合宗教教诲的感情。
And, finally, religion must so be the object and centre to which all things tend, that whoever knows the principles of religion can give an explanation both of the whole nature of man in particular, and of the whole course of the world in general. 
最后，宗教必须成为万事万物趋向的对象和中心，以便任何了解宗教原则的人都能够对人类的整个本质以及整个世界的整个进程做出解释。
 And on this ground they take occasion to revile the Christian religion, because they misunderstand it. 
基于此，他们借机辱骂基督教，因为他们误解了它。
They imagine that it consists simply in the worship of a God considered as great, powerful, and eternal; which is strictly deism, almost as far removed from the Christian religion as atheism, which is its exact opposite. 
他们认为这只是对一位被认为是伟大、强大和永恒的神的崇拜。这是严格的自然神论，几乎与无神论一样远离基督教，而无神论恰恰相反。
And thence they conclude that this religion is not true, because they do not see that all things concur to the establishment of this point, that God does not manifest Himself to men with all the evidence which He could show. 
由此他们得出结论，这种宗教是不真实的，因为他们没有看到所有的事情都符合这一点，即上帝没有向人类显现他所能展示的所有证据。
 But let them conclude what they will against deism, they will conclude nothing against the Christian religion, which properly consists in the mystery of the Redeemer, who, uniting in Himself the two natures, human and divine, has redeemed men from the corruption of sin in order to reconcile them in His divine person to God. 
但是，让他们得出他们反对自然神论的结论，他们不会得出反对基督教的结论，基督教正确地存在于救赎主的奥秘中，他将人性和神性两种本质结合在一起，将人类从罪恶的败坏中救赎出来。以便使他们以他的神圣位格与神和好。
 The Christian religion, then, teaches men these two truths; that there is a God whom men can know, and that there is a corruption in their nature which renders them unworthy of Him. 
那么，基督教教导人们这两个真理：有一位人可以认识的上帝，但人的本性有败坏，使他们不配配得上他。
It is equally important to men to know both these points; and it is equally dangerous for man to know God without knowing his own wretchedness, and to know his own wretchedness without knowing the Redeemer who can free him from it. 
对于男人来说，了解这两点同样重要。人认识上帝而不认识自己的不幸，认识自己的不幸却不认识能将他从苦难中解救出来的救赎主，这同样是危险的。
The knowledge of only one of these points gives rise either to the pride of philosophers, who have known God, and not their own wretchedness, or to the despair of atheists, who know their own wretchedness, but not the Redeemer. 
仅了解其中一点的知识就会引起哲学家的骄傲，他们认识上帝，而不是他们自己的不幸；或者会引起无神论者的绝望，他们知道自己的不幸，但不知道救赎主。
 And, as it is alike necessary to man to know these two points, so is it alike merciful of God to have made us know them. 
正如人有必要知道这两点一样，上帝让我们知道这两点也同样是仁慈的。
The Christian religion does this; it is in this that it consists. 
基督教就是这么做的。它的组成就在于此。
 Let us herein examine the order of the world, and see if all things do not tend to establish these two chief points of this religion: Jesus Christ is the end of all, and the centre to which all tends. 
让我们在这里审视一下世界的秩序，看看万事是否都倾向于建立这个宗教的两个要点：耶稣基督是一切的终结，也是一切所趋向的中心。
Whoever knows Him knows the reason of everything. 
凡认识他的人都知道一切的原因。
 Those who fall into error err only through failure to see one of these two things. 
那些犯错误的人只是因为没有看到这两件事之一。
We can then have an excellent knowledge of God without that of our own wretchedness, and of our own wretchedness without that of God. 
这样，我们就可以对上帝有深刻的认识，而无需了解自己的不幸，也可以对自己的不幸有深刻的认识，而无需上帝的认识。
But we cannot know Jesus Christ without knowing at the same time both God and our own wretchedness. 
但如果我们不能同时认识神和我们自己的不幸，就不可能认识耶稣基督。
 Therefore I shall not undertake here to prove by natural reasons either the existence of God, or the Trinity, or the immortality of the soul, or anything of that nature; not only because I should not feel myself sufficiently able to find in nature arguments to convince hardened atheists, but also because such knowledge without Jesus Christ is useless and barren. 
因此，我在这里不打算用自然理由来证明上帝的存在、三位一体、灵魂的不朽或任何类似性质的事物；不仅因为我觉得自己没有足够的能力在自然界中找到论据来说服顽固的无神论者，而且因为没有耶稣基督，这种知识是无用且贫瘠的。
Though a man should be convinced that numerical proportions are immaterial truths, eternal and dependent on a first truth, in which they subsist, and which is called God, I should not think him far advanced towards his own salvation. 
尽管一个人应该相信数字比例是非物质的真理，是永恒的，并且依赖于它们赖以生存的第一真理，即所谓的上帝，但我不认为他在自己的救赎方面取得了很大进展。
 The God of Christians is not a God who is simply the author of mathematical truths, or of the order of the elements; that is the view of heathens and Epicureans. 
基督徒的上帝不仅仅是数学真理或元素顺序的创造者；他是上帝的创造者。这是异教徒和伊壁鸠鲁主义者的观点。
He is not merely a God who exercises His providence over the life and fortunes of men, to bestow on those who worship Him a long and happy life. 
他不仅仅是一位神，他对人类的生命和财富施行天意，赐予那些敬拜他的人长寿和幸福的生活。
That was the portion of the Jews. 
那是犹太人的分。
But the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, the God of Christians, is a God of love and of comfort, a God who fills the soul and heart of those whom He possesses, a God who makes them conscious of their inward wretchedness, and His infinite mercy, who unites Himself to their inmost soul, who fills it with humility and joy, with confidence and love, who renders them incapable of any other end than Himself. 
但亚伯拉罕的神、以撒的神、雅各的神、基督徒的神，是一位慈爱和安慰的神，一位充满他所拥有之人的灵魂和心灵的神，一位使他们有意识的神。他将自己与他们最深处的灵魂结合在一起，使他们充满谦卑和喜乐，充满信心和爱，使他们除了他自己之外无法达到任何其他目的。
 All who seek God without Jesus Christ, and who rest in nature, either find no light to satisfy them, or come to form for themselves a means of knowing God and serving Him without a mediator. 
凡是在没有耶稣基督的情况下寻求上帝的人，以及在自然中休息的人，要么找不到满足他们的光，要么在没有中保的情况下为自己形成认识上帝和事奉上帝的途径。
Thereby they fall either into atheism, or into deism, two things which the Christian religion abhors almost equally. 
因此，他们要么陷入无神论，要么陷入自然神论，基督教几乎同样憎恶这两件事。
 Without Jesus Christ the world would not exist; for it should needs be either that it would be destroyed or be a hell. 
没有耶稣基督，世界就不会存在；没有耶稣基督，世界就不会存在。因为它要么被毁灭，要么成为地狱。
 If the world existed to instruct man of God, His divinity would shine through every part in it in an indisputable manner; but as it exists only by Jesus Christ, and for Jesus Christ, and to teach men both their corruption and their redemption, all displays the proofs of these two truths. 
如果世界的存在是为了教导上帝的人，那么他的神性将以无可争议的方式闪耀在世界的每一部分；但由于它只因耶稣基督而存在，并且为了耶稣基督而存在，并教导人们他们的腐败和救赎，所以所有这些都展示了这两个真理的证据。
 All appearance indicates neither a total exclusion nor a manifest presence of divinity, but the presence of a God who hides Himself. 
所有的显现既不表明神性的完全排斥，也不表明神性的明显存在，而是表明隐藏自己的上帝的存在。
Everything bears this character. 
一切都带有这个性格。
 ... 
 ...
Shall he alone who knows his nature know it only to be miserable? Shall he alone who knows it be alone unhappy?  ... 
难道只有了解自己本性的人才知道自己的本性是痛苦的吗？知道这一点的人会独自感到不快乐吗？ ...
He must not see nothing at all, nor must he see sufficient for him to believe he possesses it; but he must see enough to know that he has lost it. 
他一定不能看到任何东西，也不能看到足以让他相信他拥有它；但他必须看得足够多才能知道他已经失去了它。
For to know of his loss, he must see and not see; and that is exactly the state in which he naturally is. 
为了知道他的损失，他必须看到而不是看到；这正是他自然的状态。
 ... 
 ...
Whatever part he takes, I shall not leave him at rest ... 
无论他扮演什么角色，我都不会让他安息……
  556  ... 
第556章
It is then true that everything teaches man his condition, but he must understand this well. 
确实，一切都告诉人他的处境，但他必须很好地理解这一点。
For it is not true that all reveals God, and it is not true that all conceals God. 
因为并非一切都显明神，也不是一切都隐藏神。
But it is at the same time true that He hides Himself from those who tempt Him, and that He reveals Himself to those who seek Him, because men are both unworthy and capable of God; unworthy by their corruption capable by their original nature. 
但同时，他向那些试探他的人隐藏自己，又向那些寻求他的人显现自己，因为人既不配，又有能力敬拜神；因此，人既不配，又能够敬拜神。由于他们的腐败本性而使他们不配。
  557  What shall we conclude from all our darkness, but our unworthiness?   558  If there never had been any appearance of God, this eternal deprivation would have been equivocal, and might have as well corresponded with the absence of all divinity, as with the unworthiness of men to know Him; but His occasional, though not continual, appearances remove the ambiguity, If He appeared once, He exists always; and thus we cannot but conclude both that there is a God, and that men are unworthy of Him. 
第557章558如果上帝从未出现过，那么这种永恒的剥夺就会是模棱两可的，并且可能与所有神性的缺失相对应，也可能与人类不配认识他相一致；但他偶尔出现（尽管不是持续出现）消除了歧义：如果他出现一次，他就永远存在；如果他出现一次，他就永远存在；如果他出现一次，他就永远存在。因此，我们不能不得出这样的结论：有一位上帝，而人不配拥有他。
  559  We do not understand the glorious state of Adam, nor the nature of his sin, nor the transmission of it to us. 
 559 我们不了解亚当的荣耀状态，也不了解他的罪的本质，也不了解它对我们的影响。
These are matters which took place under conditions of a nature altogether different from our own, and which transcend our present understanding. 
这些事情是在与我们完全不同的性质条件下发生的，并且超越了我们目前的理解。
 The knowledge of all this is useless to us as a means of escape from it; and all that we are concerned to know, is that we are miserable, corrupt, separated from God, but ransomed by Jesus Christ, whereof we have wonderful proofs on earth. 
所有这一切的知识对我们来说并不能作为逃避它的手段。我们所关心的是，我们是悲惨的、腐败的、与上帝隔绝的，但却被耶稣基督救赎了，这在地球上有奇妙的证据。
 So the two proofs of corruption and redemption are drawn from the ungodly, who live in indifference to religion, and from the Jews who are irreconcilable enemies. 
因此，腐败和救赎的两个证据来自于生活在对宗教漠不关心的不敬虔的人，以及来自不共戴天的敌人的犹太人。
  560  There are two ways of proving the truths of our religion; one by the power of reason, the other by the authority of him who speaks. 
 560 有两种方法可以证明我们宗教的真理；一个是依靠理性的力量，另一个是依靠说话者的权威。
 We do not make use of the latter, but of the former. 
我们不使用后者，而是使用前者。
"We do not say, ""This must be believed, for Scripture, which says it, is divine."" But we say that it must be believed for such and such a reason, which are feeble arguments, as reason may be bent to everything. "
我们不会说：“这必须被相信，因为圣经上这么说，是神圣的。”但我们说，必须出于这样那样的理由来相信它，这是站不住脚的论据，因为理性可能会屈服于一切。
  561  There is nothing on earth that does not show either the wretchedness of man, or the mercy of God; either the weakness of man without God, or the strength of man with God. 
561 地球上没有任何事物不表现出人类的悲惨，或上帝的怜悯；要么是人没有上帝的软弱，要么是人有上帝的力量。
  562  It will be one of the confusions of the damned to see that they are condemned by their own reason, by which they claimed to condemn the Christian religion. 
 562 那些被诅咒的人的困惑之一是看到他们被自己的理性所谴责，他们声称以此来谴责基督教。
  563  The prophecies, the very miracles and proofs of our religion, are not of such a nature that they can be said to be absolutely convincing. 
 563 我们宗教的预言、奇迹和证据本身并不具有可以说是绝对令人信服的性质。
But they are also of such a kind that it cannot be said that it is unreasonable to believe them. 
但它们又是这样一种，不能说相信它们是没有道理的。
Thus there is both evidence and obscurity to enlighten some and confuse others. 
因此，既有证据也有晦涩难懂的东西，可以启发一些人，却使另一些人感到困惑。
But the evidence is such that it surpasses, or at least equals, the evidence to the contrary; so that it is not reason which can determine men not to follow it, and thus it can only be lust or malice of heart. 
但证据足以超越或至少等于相反的证据；因此，理性不能决定人们不遵循它，而只能是欲望或内心的恶意。
And by this means there is sufficient evidence to condemn, and insufficient to convince; so that it appears in those who follow it, that it is grace, and not reason, which makes them follow it; and in those who shun it, that it is lust, not reason, which makes them shun it. 
通过这种方式，有足够的证据来谴责，但不足以令人信服；因此，在那些追随它的人看来，促使他们追随它的是恩典，而不是理性。对于那些回避它的人来说，是欲望，而不是理性，使他们回避它。
 _Vere discipuli, vere Israëlita, vere liberi, vere cibus._[207]   564  Recognise, then, the truth of religion in the very obscurity of religion, in the little light we have of it, and in the indifference which we have to knowing it. 
 _Vere discipuli, vere Israëlita, vere liberi, vere cibus._[207] 564 那么，在宗教的晦涩难懂中、在我们对它的了解甚少、在我们必须了解的冷漠中认识到宗教的真理它。
  565  We understand nothing of the works of God, if we do not take as a principle that He has willed to blind some, and enlighten others. 
 565 如果我们不以上帝愿意蒙蔽一些人、启发另一些人为原则，我们就对上帝的作为一无所知。
  566  The two contrary reasons. 
第566章 两个相反的理由。
We must begin with that; without that we understand nothing, and all is heretical; and we must even add at the end of each truth that the opposite truth is to be remembered. 
我们必须从这个开始；没有它，我们就一无所知，一切都是异端；我们甚至必须在每个真理的末尾加上要记住的相反真理。
  567  _Objection._ The Scripture is plainly full of matters not dictated by the Holy Spirit.--_Answer._ Then they do not harm faith.--_Objection._ But the Church has decided that all is of the Holy Spirit.--_Answer._ I answer two things: first, the Church has not so decided; secondly, if she should so decide, it could be maintained. 
第567章_答案._ 我回答两件事：首先，教会还没有这样决定；其次，如果她做出这样的决定，就可以维持下去。
 Do you think that the prophecies cited in the Gospel are related to make you believe? No, it is to keep you from believing. 
你认为福音书中引用的预言与让你相信有关吗？不，这是为了让你不相信。
  568  _Canonical._--The heretical books in the beginning of the Church serve to prove the canonical. 
 568_正典._--教会初期的异端书籍是用来证明正典的。
  569  To the chapter on the _Fundamentals_ must be added that on _Typology_ touching the reason of types: why Jesus Christ was prophesied as to His first coming; why prophesied obscurely as to the manner. 
 569 在《基本原理》一章中，必须添加《预表论》一章，涉及预表的原因：为何预言耶稣基督的第一次降临；为什么隐晦地预言了方式。
  570  _The reason why. 
第570章_
Types._--[They had to deal with a carnal people and to render them the depositary of the spiritual covenant.] To give faith to the Messiah, it was necessary there should have been precedent prophecies, and that these should be conveyed by persons above suspicion, diligent, faithful, unusually zealous, and known to all the world. 
预表。_--[他们必须与属肉体的人民打交道，并让他们成为属灵之约的保管人。]为了给予弥赛亚信心，必须有先例的预言，并且这些预言应该由无可怀疑、勤奋、忠诚、异常热心且为全世界所知的人。
 To accomplish all this, God chose this carnal people, to whom He entrusted the prophecies which foretell the Messiah as a deliverer, and as a dispenser of those carnal goods which this people loved. 
为了实现这一切，上帝选择了这个属肉体的民族，并把预言托付给他们，预言弥赛亚是一个拯救者，也是这个民族所喜爱的那些属肉体的物品的分配者。
And thus they have had an extraordinary passion for their prophets, and, in sight of the whole world, have had charge of these books which foretell their Messiah, assuring all nations that He should come, and in the way foretold in the books, which they held open to the whole world. 
因此，他们对他们的先知有着非凡的热情，并且在全世界的视野中，负责这些预言他们的弥赛亚的书，向所有国家保证他会到来，并以书中预言的方式，他们向全世界开放。
Yet this people, deceived by the poor and ignominious advent of the Messiah, have been His most cruel enemies. 
然而，这些人民被弥赛亚的可怜而可耻的降临所欺骗，成为了他最残酷的敌人。
So that they, the people least open to suspicion in the world of favouring us, the most strict and most zealous that can be named for their law and their prophets, have kept the books incorrupt. 
因此，他们，世界上最不值得怀疑的偏袒我们的人，最严格和最热心的人，可以用他们的法律和先知来命名，他们保持了书籍的廉洁。
Hence those who have rejected and crucified Jesus Christ, who has been to them an offence, are those who have charge of the books which testify of Him, and state that He will be an offence and rejected. 
因此，那些拒绝耶稣基督并将其钉在十字架上的人，因为耶稣基督对他们来说是一种冒犯，他们负责那些为他作见证的书籍，并声称他将成为冒犯并被拒绝。
Therefore they have shown it was He by rejecting Him, and He has been alike proved both by the righteous Jews who received Him, and by the unrighteous who rejected Him, both facts having been foretold. 
因此，他们通过拒绝他来证明他就是他，而接受他的正义的犹太人和拒绝他的不义的犹太人都同样证明了他，这两个事实都已被预言。
 Wherefore the prophecies have a hidden and spiritual meaning, to which this people were hostile, under the carnal meaning which they loved. 
因此，这些预言具有隐藏的精神意义，而这些人却敌视它，而他们所喜爱的属肉体意义却是这样的。
If the spiritual meaning had been revealed, they would not have loved it, and, unable to bear it, they would not have been zealous of the preservation of their books and their ceremonies; and if they had loved these spiritual promises, and had preserved them incorrupt till the time of the Messiah, their testimony would have had no force, because they had been his friends. 
如果其精神意义被揭示出来，他们就不会喜欢它，而且，由于无法忍受，他们就不会热衷于保存他们的书籍和仪式；如果他们喜爱这些属灵的应许，并且在弥赛亚时代之前一直保持这些应许不被腐蚀，那么他们的见证就没有任何效力，因为他们曾是他的朋友。
 Therefore it was well that the spiritual meaning should be concealed; but, on the other hand, if this meaning had been so hidden as not to appear at all, it could not have served as a proof of the Messiah. 
因此，最好将其精神意义隐藏起来。但另一方面，如果这个意义被隐藏得根本不出现，它就不能作为弥赛亚存在的证据。
What then was done? In a crowd of passages it has been hidden under the temporal meaning, and in a few has been clearly revealed; besides that the time and the state of the world have been so clearly foretold that it is clearer than the sun. 
然后做了什么？在许多段落中，它被隐藏在时间意义之下，而在少数段落中，它被清楚地揭示出来。除此之外，世界的时间和状态已经被如此清楚地预言得比太阳还清楚。
And in some places this spiritual meaning is so clearly expressed, that it would require a blindness like that which the flesh imposes on the spirit when it is subdued by it, not to recognise it. 
在某些地方，这种精神意义表达得如此清楚，以至于需要一种盲目性，就像肉体在精神被它征服时强加给精神的盲目性一样，不认识它。
 See, then, what has been the prudence of God. 
那么，看看上帝是何等的审慎。
This meaning is concealed under another in an infinite number of passages, and in some, though rarely, it is revealed; but yet so that the passages in which it is concealed are equivocal, and can suit both meanings; whereas the passages where it is disclosed are unequivocal, and can only suit the spiritual meaning. 
这种意义在无数的段落中被隐藏在另一种意义之下，在某些段落中，尽管很少，它还是被揭示出来了。但隐藏它的段落是模棱两可的，并且可以满足两种含义；而所揭示的段落却是明确的，只能符合精神意义。
 So that this cannot lead us into error, and could only be misunderstood by so carnal a people. 
因此，这不能使我们陷入错误，而只能被如此属肉体的人民所误解。
 For when blessings are promised in abundance, what was to prevent them from understanding the true blessings, but their covetousness, which limited the meaning to worldly goods? But those whose only good was in God referred them to God alone. 
因为当丰盛的祝福被应许时，除了他们的贪婪之外，还有什么阻止他们理解真正的祝福呢？这限制了世俗物品的意义？但那些认为唯一的善在于上帝的人则将他们归咎于上帝。
For there are two principles, which divide the wills of men, covetousness and charity. 
因为有两个原则可以区分人的意志：贪婪和慈善。
Not that covetousness cannot exist along with faith in God, nor charity with worldly riches; but covetousness uses God, and enjoys the world, and charity is the opposite. 
这并不是说贪婪不能与对上帝的信仰同时存在，慈善也不能与世俗的财富同时存在。贪婪却利用神，享受世界，而仁爱则相反。
 Now the ultimate end gives names to things. 
现在，最终的目的给事物命名。
All which prevents us from attaining it, is called an enemy to us. 
一切阻碍我们实现这一目标的事物都被称为我们的敌人。
Thus the creatures, however good, are the enemies of the righteous, when they turn them away from God, and God Himself is the enemy of those whose covetousness He confounds. 
因此，受造物，无论多么善良，当义人背离上帝时，他们就成了义人的敌人，而上帝本身就是那些他挫败贪婪之人的敌人。
" Thus as the significance of the word ""enemy"" is dependent on the ultimate end, the righteous understood by it their passions, and the carnal the Babylonians; and so these terms were obscure only for the unrighteous. "
因此，“敌人”这个词的意义取决于最终的目的，义人用它来理解他们的激情，而肉欲则用它来理解巴比伦人。因此，这些术语只有对不义之人来说才显得晦涩难懂。
And this is what Isaiah says: _Signa legem in electis meis_,[208] and that Jesus Christ shall be a stone of stumbling. 
这就是以赛亚所说的：_Signa Legem in electis meis_，[208] 并且耶稣基督将成为一块绊脚石。
"But, ""Blessed are they who shall not be offended in him."" Hosea,[209] _ult._, says excellently, ""Where is the wise? and he shall understand what I say. "
但是，“不因他而生气的人有福了”。何西阿，[209] _ult._，出色地说道：“智者在哪里？他必明白我所说的话。
"The righteous shall know them, for the ways of God are right; but the transgressors shall fall therein.""   571  Hypothesis that the apostles were impostors.--The time clearly, the manner obscurely.--Five typical proofs. "
义人必认识他们，因为神的道是正直的； 571 使徒是骗子的假设。--时间清楚，方式模糊。--五个典型的证据。
        {1600 prophets. 
 {1600 个先知。
  2000 {        { 400 scattered. 
 2000 { { 400 分散。
"  572  _Blindness of Scripture._--""The Scripture,"" said the Jews, ""says that we shall not know whence Christ will come (John vii, 27, and xii, 34). "
 572_圣经的盲目性。_--“圣经，”犹太人说，“说我们不知道基督将从哪里来（约翰福音第七章 27 节和十二章 34 节）。
"The Scripture says that Christ abideth for ever, and He said that He should die."" Therefore, says Saint John,[210] they believed not, though He had done so many miracles, that the word of Isaiah might be fulfilled: ""He hath blinded them,"" etc. "
圣经说基督永远长存，并且他说他会死。”因此，圣约翰说，[210]他们不相信，尽管他行了如此多的奇迹，以便应验以赛亚的话：“他使他们失明了，”等等。
  573  _Greatness._--Religion is so great a thing that it is right that those who will not take the trouble to seek it, if it be obscure, should be deprived of it. 
 573_伟大._--宗教是如此伟大，以至于那些不愿费力寻求它的人，如果它晦涩难懂，就应该被剥夺它。
Why, then, do any complain, if it be such as can be found by seeking?   574  All things work together for good to the elect, even the obscurities of Scripture; for they honour them because of what is divinely clear. 
既然可以通过寻找找到答案，那为什么还有人抱怨呢？ 574 万事互相效力，造福于选民，即使是晦涩难懂的圣经；因为他们尊敬他们是因为神圣的事情是清楚的。
And all things work together for evil to the rest of the world, even what is clear; for they revile such, because of the obscurities which they do not understand. 
所有事物都共同作用，给世界其他地方带来邪恶，即使是显而易见的事情；因为他们辱骂这样的人，因为他们不理解这些晦涩难懂的内容。
  575  _The general conduct of the world towards the Church: God willing to blind and to enlighten._--The event having proved the divinity of these prophecies, the rest ought to be believed. 
 575_世界对教会的一般行为：上帝愿意蒙蔽和启发。_--事件已经证明了这些预言的神性，其余的都应该相信。
And thereby we see the order of the world to be of this kind. 
由此我们看到世界的秩序就是这样的。
The miracles of the Creation and the Deluge being forgotten, God sends the law and the miracles of Moses, the prophets who prophesied particular things; and to prepare a lasting miracle, He prepares prophecies and their fulfilment; but, as the prophecies could be suspected, He desires to make them above suspicion, etc. 
创造和大洪水的奇迹被遗忘了，上帝颁布了律法和摩西的奇迹，这些先知预言了特定的事情；为了准备一个持久的奇迹，他准备了预言及其实现；但是，正如这些预言可能受到怀疑一样，他希望使它们变得无可怀疑，等等。
  576  God has made the blindness of this people subservient to the good of the elect. 
576 上帝让这个民族的盲目屈从于选民的利益。
  577  There is sufficient clearness to enlighten the elect, and sufficient obscurity to humble them. 
 577 有足够的清晰来启发选民，也有足够的晦涩来使他们谦卑。
There is sufficient obscurity to blind the reprobate, and sufficient clearness to condemn them, and make them inexcusable.--Saint Augustine, Montaigne, Sébond. 
有足够的模糊性来蒙蔽恶棍，也有足够的清晰性来谴责他们，使他们不可原谅。——圣奥古斯丁、蒙田、塞邦。
 The genealogy of Jesus Christ in the Old Testament is intermingled with so many others that are useless, that it cannot be distinguished. 
旧约中耶稣基督的家谱与许多其他无用的家谱混杂在一起，以至于无法区分。
If Moses had kept only the record of the ancestors of Christ, that might have been too plain. 
如果摩西只保留基督祖先的记录，那就太明显了。
If he had not noted that of Jesus Christ, it might not have been sufficiently plain. 
如果他没有注意到耶稣基督，事情可能还不够清楚。
But, after all, whoever looks closely sees that of Jesus Christ expressly traced through Tamar,[211] Ruth,[212] etc. 
但是，毕竟，无论谁仔细观察，都会发现耶稣基督是通过塔玛，[211]路得，[212]等明确追踪的。
 Those who ordained these sacrifices, knew their uselessness; those who have declared their uselessness, have not ceased to practise them. 
那些规定这些祭品的人知道它们毫无用处。那些宣称它们毫无用处的人并没有停止实践它们。
 If God had permitted only one religion, it had been too easily known; but when we look at it closely, we clearly discern the truth amidst this confusion. 
如果上帝只允许一种宗教，那么它就太容易为人所知了。但当我们仔细观察时，我们就会在混乱中清楚地看出真相。
 _The premiss._--Moses was a clever man. 
 _前提._--摩西是个聪明人。
If, then, he ruled himself by his reason, he would say nothing clearly which was directly against reason. 
那么，如果他用理性来统治自己，他就不会明确地说出任何直接违背理性的事情。
 Thus all the very apparent weaknesses are strength. 
因此，所有明显的弱点都是优点。
Example; the two genealogies in Saint Matthew and Saint Luke. 
例子;圣马太和圣路加的两个家谱。
What can be clearer than that this was not concerted?   578  God (and the Apostles), foreseeing that the seeds of pride would make heresies spring up, and being unwilling to give them occasion to arise from correct expressions, has put in Scripture and the prayers of the Church contrary words and sentences to produce their fruit in time. 
还有什么比这不是一致行动更清楚的呢？ 578 上帝（和使徒）预见到骄傲的种子会滋生异端，并且不愿意给它们机会从正确的表达中产生，所以在圣经和教会的祈祷中放入了相反的词语和句子，以产生他们的水果及时。
 So in morals He gives charity, which produces fruits contrary to lust. 
因此，在道德上，他施予仁爱，这会产生与情欲相反的果子。
  579  Nature has some perfections to show that she is the image of God, and some defects to show that she is only His image. 
 579 大自然有一些完美，表明她是上帝的形象，也有一些缺陷，表明她只是上帝的形象。
  580  God prefers rather to incline the will than the intellect. 
580 上帝更喜欢偏向意志而非智力。
Perfect clearness would be of use to the intellect, and would harm the will. 
完全清晰对智力有用，但会损害意志。
To humble pride. 
为卑微的骄傲。
  581  We make an idol of truth itself; for truth apart from charity is not God, but His image and idol, which we must neither love nor worship; and still less must we love or worship its opposite, namely, falsehood. 
第581章因为离开仁的真理就不是上帝，而是他的形象和偶像，我们既不能爱也不能崇拜他。我们更不必热爱或崇拜它的对立面，即虚假。
 I can easily love total darkness; but if God keeps me in a state of semi-darkness, such partial darkness displeases me, and, because I do not see therein the advantage of total darkness, it is unpleasant to me. 
我很容易喜欢完全的黑暗；但如果上帝让我处于半黑暗的状态，这种部分的黑暗就会令我不高兴，而且因为我看不到完全黑暗的好处，所以我也不喜欢。
This is a fault, and a sign that I make for myself an idol of darkness, apart from the order of God. 
这是一个错误，也是我为自己树立一个脱离上帝命令的黑暗偶像的标志。
Now only His order must be worshipped. 
现在只有他的命令必须被崇拜。
  582  The feeble-minded are people who know the truth, but only affirm it so far as consistent with their own interest. 
 582 弱智者是知道真理的人，但只在符合自己利益的情况下确认真理。
But, apart from that, they renounce it. 
但是，除此之外，他们放弃了它。
  583  The world exists for the exercise of mercy and judgment, not as if men were placed in it out of the hands of God, but as hostile to God; and to them He grants by grace sufficient light, that they may return to Him, if they desire to seek and follow Him; and also that they may be punished, if they refuse to seek or follow Him. 
583世界的存在是为了施行仁慈和审判，这并不是说人被置于神的手中，而是与神为敌；他借着恩典赐给他们足够的亮光，使他们若愿意寻求并跟随他，就可以归向他。如果他们拒绝寻求或跟随他，他们也可能会受到惩罚。
  584  _That God has willed to hide Himself._--If there were only one religion, God would indeed be manifest. 
 584_上帝愿意隐藏自己。_--如果只有一种宗教，上帝确实会显现。
The same would be the case, if there were no martyrs but in our religion. 
如果除了我们的宗教之外没有殉道者，情况也会如此。
 God being thus hidden, every religion which does not affirm that God is hidden, is not true; and every religion which does not give the reason of it, is not instructive. 
上帝如此隐藏，任何不肯定上帝隐藏的宗教都不是真实的。任何宗教如果不给出其理由，就没有教育意义。
Our religion does, all this: _Vere tu es Deus absconditus._   585  If there were no obscurity, man would not be sensible of his corruption; if there were no light, man would not hope for a remedy. 
我们的宗教所做的一切都是：_Vere tu es Deus Abconditus。_ 585 如果没有晦涩难懂，人就不会意识到自己的腐败；如果没有光，人类就不会希望得到补救。
Thus, it is not only fair, but advantageous to us, that God be partly hidden and partly revealed; since it is equally dangerous to man to know God without knowing his own wretchedness, and to know his own wretchedness without knowing God. 
因此，上帝部分隐藏、部分显现，不仅公平，而且对我们有利。因为对人来说，认识上帝而不认识自己的不幸，和认识自己的不幸却不认识上帝，都是同样危险的。
  586  This religion, so great in miracles, saints, blameless Fathers, learned and great witnesses, martyrs, established kings as David, and Isaiah, a prince of the blood, and so great in science, after having displayed all her miracles and all her wisdom, rejects all this, and declares that she has neither wisdom nor signs, but only the cross and foolishness. 
 586 这个宗教，在奇迹、圣人、无可指摘的教父、博学而伟大的见证者、烈士、建立像大卫和以赛亚这样的君王、血统王子、在科学方面如此伟大，在展示了她所有的奇迹和她所有的一切之后，智慧，拒绝这一切，并宣称她既没有智慧，也没有神迹，只有十字架和愚昧。
 For those, who, by these signs and that wisdom, have deserved your belief, and who have proved to you their character, declare to you that nothing of all this can change you, and render you capable of knowing and loving God, but the power of the foolishness of the cross without wisdom and signs, and not the signs without this power. 
对于那些通过这些迹象和智慧值得你相信的人，以及那些已经向你证明了他们的品格的人，他们向你宣告，这一切都不能改变你，使你有能力认识和爱上帝，但十字架的愚昧力量，没有智慧和神迹，没有神迹，就没有这种能力。
Thus our religion is foolish in respect to the effective cause, and wise in respect to the wisdom which prepares it. 
因此，就有效原因而言，我们的宗教是愚蠢的，而就准备原因而言，我们的宗教是明智的。
  587  Our religion is wise and foolish. 
 587 我们的宗教是明智的，也是愚蠢的。
Wise, because it is the most learned, and the most founded on miracles, prophecies, etc. 
明智的，因为它是最有学问的，也是最有根据的奇迹、预言等。
Foolish, because it is not all this which makes us belong to it. 
愚蠢的是，因为这一切并不能让我们属于它。
This makes us indeed condemn those who do not belong to it; but it does not cause belief in those who do belong to it. 
这确实使我们谴责那些不属于它的人；但它并不会引起那些属于它的人的信任。
It is the cross that makes them believe, _ne evacuata sit crux_. 
正是十字架让他们相信，_ne evacuata sat crux_。
And so Saint Paul, who came with wisdom and signs, says that he has come neither with wisdom nor with signs; for he came to convert. 
因此，带着智慧和神迹到来的圣保罗说，他既不是带着智慧，也不是带着神迹来的；他是带着智慧和神迹而来的。因为他是来皈依的。
But those who come only to convince, can say that they come with wisdom and with signs. 
但那些只是为了说服人而来的人，可以说他们带着智慧和迹象而来。
    SECTION IX  PERPETUITY   588  _On the fact that the Christian religion is not the only religion._--So far is this from being a reason for believing that it is not the true one, that, on the contrary, it makes us see that it is so. 
第九节 永续性 588 _关于基督教不是唯一的宗教这一事实。_--这远不是一个相信它不是真正的宗教的理由，相反，它使我们看到它是这样。
  589  Men must be sincere in all religions; true heathens, true Jews, true Christians. 
589 人对所有宗教都必须真诚；真正的异教徒，真正的犹太人，真正的基督徒。

  591  _The falseness of other religions._--They have no witnesses. 
第591章_其他宗教的虚假。_--他们没有见证人。
Jews have. 
犹太人有。
God defies other religions to produce such signs: Isaiah xliii, 9; xliv, 8. 
上帝蔑视其他宗教来产生这样的迹象：以赛亚书 xliii，9； xliv，8。
  592  _History of China._[213]-I believe only the histories, whose witnesses got themselves killed. 
 592_中国历史._[213]-我只相信历史，那些历史的目击者都被杀了。
 [Which is the more credible of the two, Moses or China?]  It is not a question of seeing this summarily. 
 [摩西和中国这两者中哪一个更可信？] 这不是一个概括地看待这一点的问题。
I tell you there is in it something to blind, and something to enlighten. 
我告诉你，这里面有一些让人盲目的东西，也有一些让人启发的东西。
 By this one word I destroy all your reasoning. 
我就凭这一句话，毁掉你所有的推理。
"But China obscures, say you; and I answer, ""China obscures, but there is clearness to be found; seek it.""  Thus all that you say makes for one of the views, and not at all against the other. "
但你说，中国却让人感到晦涩难懂；我回答说：“中国晦涩难懂，但有清晰可寻；寻找它。”因此，你所说的一切都支持其中一种观点，而不是反对另一种观点。
So this serves, and does no harm. 
所以这很有用，而且没有坏处。
 We must then see this in detail; we must put the papers on the table. 
然后我们必须详细地了解这一点；我们必须把文件摆到桌面上。
  593  _Against the history of China._ The historians of Mexico, the five suns,[214] of which the last is only eight hundred years old. 
 593_反对中国的历史。_墨西哥的历史学家，五个太阳，[214]其中最后一个只有八百年的历史。
 The difference between a book accepted by a nation, and one which makes a nation. 
一本被一个国家接受的书和一本造就一个国家的书之间的区别。
  594  Mahomet was without authority. 
 594 穆罕默德没有权力。
His reasons then should have been very strong, having only their own force. 
那么他的理由应该很充分，只有自己的力量。
What does he say then, that we must believe him?   595  The Psalms are chanted throughout the whole world. 
那么他怎么说我们必须相信他呢？ 595 全世界都在吟诵《诗篇》。
 Who renders testimony to Mahomet? Himself. 
谁向穆罕默德作证？他自己。
Jesus Christ[215] desires His own testimony to be as nothing. 
耶稣基督[215]希望自己的见证如同虚无。
 The quality of witnesses necessitates their existence always and everywhere; and he, miserable creature, is alone. 
证人的素质要求他们随时随地都存在；而他，这个可怜的家伙，却是孤独一人。
  596  _Against Mahomet._--The Koran is not more of Mahomet than the Gospel is of Saint Matthew, for it is cited by many authors from age to age. 
 596_反对穆罕默德._--《古兰经》并不比《福音书》更多地属于圣马太那样属于穆罕默德，因为历代许多作者都引用它。
Even its very enemies, Celsus and Porphyry, never denied it. 
即使是它的敌人塞尔苏斯和波菲利也从未否认过这一点。
 The Koran says Saint Matthew was an honest man.[216] Therefore Mahomet was a false prophet for calling honest men wicked, or for not agreeing with what they have said of Jesus Christ. 
《古兰经》说圣马太是一个诚实的人。 [216]因此，穆罕默德是一个假先知，因为他称诚实的人为邪恶的人，或者不同意他们对耶稣基督的评价。
  597  It is not by that which is obscure in Mahomet, and which may be interpreted in a mysterious sense, that I would have him judged, but by what is clear, as his paradise and the rest. 
 597 我希望对穆罕默德的判断不是通过那些晦涩难懂的内容，也不是通过神秘的含义来解释，而是通过清晰的内容，如他的天堂和其他地方。
In that he is ridiculous. 
在这一点上他是可笑的。
And since what is clear is ridiculous, it is not right to take his obscurities for mysteries. 
既然显而易见的事情是荒谬的，所以将他的晦涩难懂视为神秘是不正确的。
 It is not the same with the Scripture. 
这与圣经不一样。
I agree that there are in it obscurities as strange as those of Mahomet; but there are admirably clear passages, and the prophecies are manifestly fulfilled. 
我同意其中有一些晦涩难懂的内容，就像穆罕默德的晦涩难懂之处一样。但其中的段落非常清晰，而且预言也明显应验了。
The cases are therefore not on a par. 
因此，这些案件并不相提并论。
We must not confound, and put on one level things which only resemble each other in their obscurity, and not in the clearness, which requires us to reverence the obscurities. 
我们不能把那些只在晦涩难懂而非清晰方面相似的事物混为一谈，放在同一水平上，这要求我们尊重晦涩难懂的事物。
  598  _The difference between Jesus Christ and Mahomet._--Mahomet was not foretold; Jesus Christ was foretold. 
第598章_耶稣基督和穆罕默德之间的区别。_--穆罕默德没有被预言；耶稣基督已被预言。
 Mahomet slew; Jesus Christ caused His own to be slain. 
穆罕默德被杀；耶稣基督让自己的人被杀。
 Mahomet forbade reading; the Apostles ordered reading. 
穆罕默德禁止读书；使徒们命令阅读。
 In fact the two are so opposed, that if Mahomet took the way to succeed from a worldly point of view, Jesus Christ, from the same point of view, took the way to perish. 
事实上，两者是如此对立，如果穆罕默德从世俗的角度来看走的是成功的道路，那么从同样的角度来看，耶稣基督走的是灭亡的道路。
And instead of concluding that, since Mahomet succeeded, Jesus Christ might well have succeeded, we ought to say that since Mahomet succeeded, Jesus Christ should have failed. 
我们不应该得出这样的结论：既然穆罕默德成功了，耶稣基督也很可能成功了，我们应该说，既然穆罕默德成功了，耶稣基督就应该失败了。
  599  Any man can do what Mahomet has done; for he performed no miracles, he was not foretold. 
 599 穆罕默德所做的事，任何人都可以做；因为他没有创造奇迹，所以没有人预言他。
No man can do what Christ has done. 
没有人能做基督所做的事。
  600  The heathen religion has no foundation [at the present day. 
 600 异教没有根基[在当今。
It is said once to have had a foundation by the oracles which spoke. 
据说曾经有一个由神谕所说的基础。
But what are the books which assure us of this? Are they so worthy of belief on account of the virtue of their authors? Have they been preserved with such care that we can be sure that they have not been meddled with?]  The Mahometan religion has for a foundation the Koran and Mahomet. 
但是有哪些书可以让我们确信这一点呢？由于作者的美德，它们就那么值得相信吗？它们是否得到了如此精心的保存，以至于我们可以确定它们没有受到干扰？] 穆罕默德宗教以《古兰经》和穆罕默德为基础。
But has this prophet, who was to be the last hope of the world, been foretold? What sign has he that every other man has not, who chooses to call himself a prophet? What miracles does he himself say that he has done? What mysteries has he taught, even according to his own tradition? What was the morality, what the happiness held out by him?  The Jewish religion must be differently regarded in the tradition of the Holy Bible, and in the tradition of the people. 
但是这位将成为世界最后希望的先知是否被预言过呢？他有什么迹象是其他人没有的，却选择称自己为先知？他自己说他创造了哪些奇迹？即使按照他自己的传统，他也教导过什么奥秘？他所拥有的道德是什么，幸福是什么？在圣经的传统和人民的传统中，必须以不同的方式看待犹太宗教。
Its morality and happiness are absurd in the tradition of the people, but are admirable in that of the Holy Bible. 
它的道德和幸福在民间传统中是荒谬的，但在圣经中却是令人敬佩的。
(And all religion is the same; for the Christian religion is very different in the Holy Bible and in the casuists.) The foundation is admirable; it is the most ancient book in the world, and the most authentic; and whereas Mahomet, in order to make his own book continue in existence, forbade men to read it, Moses,[217] for the same reason, ordered every one to read his. 
（所有的宗教都是一样的；因为基督教在《圣经》和诡辩家中是非常不同的。） 基础是令人钦佩的；它是世界上最古老、最真实的书；穆罕默德为了让他自己的书继续存在，禁止人们阅读它，而摩西[217]出于同样的原因，命令每个人都阅读他的书。
 Our religion is so divine that another divine religion has only been the foundation of it. 
我们的宗教如此神圣，以至于另一种神圣的宗教只是它的基础。
  601  _Order._--To see what is clear and indisputable in the whole state of the Jews. 
 601_秩序._--看看犹太人整个状况中什么是清楚的、无可争议的。
  602  The Jewish religion is wholly divine in its authority, its duration, its perpetuity, its morality, its doctrine, and its effects. 
 602 犹太教的权威、持续时间、永恒性、道德、教义和影响都是完全神圣的。
  603  The only science contrary to common sense and human nature is that alone which has always existed among men. 
 603 唯一与常识和人性相反的科学是人类中一直存在的科学。
  604  The only religion contrary to nature, to common sense, and to our pleasure, is that alone which has always existed. 
 604 唯一违反自然、常识和我们的快乐的宗教是唯一一直存在的宗教。
  605  No religion but our own has taught that man is born in sin. 
605 除我们自己的宗教外，没有任何宗教教导人生来就有罪。
No sect of philosophers has said this. 
没有哪个哲学家派别说过这样的话。
Therefore none have declared the truth. 
因此没有人说出真相。
 No sect or religion has always existed on earth, but the Christian religion. 
除了基督教之外，地球上从来没有任何教派或宗教存在。
  606  Whoever judges of the Jewish religion by its coarser forms will misunderstand it. 
 606 任何以粗俗形式来评判犹太教的人都会误解它。
It is to be seen in the Holy Bible, and in the tradition of the prophets, who have made it plain enough that they did not interpret the law according to the letter. 
从《圣经》和先知的传统中可以看出，他们已经清楚地表明，他们并没有按照字面意思解释法律。
So our religion is divine in the Gospel, in the Apostles, and in tradition; but it is absurd in those who tamper with it. 
因此，我们的宗教在福音、使徒和传统中都是神圣的。但对于那些篡改它的人来说，这是荒谬的。
 The Messiah, according to the carnal Jews, was to be a great temporal prince. 
根据属肉体的犹太人的说法，弥赛亚是一位伟大的世俗王子。
Jesus Christ, according to carnal Christians,[218] has come to dispense us from the love of God, and to give us sacraments which shall do everything without our help. 
根据属肉体的基督徒的说法，[218] 耶稣基督来是为了让我们脱离神的爱，并赐给我们圣礼，这些圣礼可以在没有我们帮助的情况下完成一切。
Such is not the Christian religion, nor the Jewish. 
这不是基督教，也不是犹太教。
True Jews and true Christians have always expected a Messiah who should make them love God, and by that love triumph over their enemies. 
真正的犹太人和真正的基督徒一直期待弥赛亚能够让他们爱上帝，并通过这种爱战胜他们的敌人。
  607  The carnal Jews hold a midway place between Christians and heathens. 
 607 属肉体的犹太人处于基督徒和异教徒之间。
The heathens know not God, and love the world only. 
异教徒不认识上帝，只爱世界。
The Jews know the true God, and love the world only. 
犹太人认识真神，只爱世界。
The Christians know the true God, and love not the world. 
基督徒认识真神，不爱世界。
Jews and heathens love the same good. 
犹太人和异教徒都热爱同样的美好事物。
Jews and Christians know the same God. 
犹太人和基督徒认识同一位神。
 The Jews were of two kinds; the first had only heathen affections, the other had Christian affections. 
犹太人有两种：第一个只有异教徒的情感，另一个则有基督教的情感。
  608  There are two kinds of men in each religion: among the heathen, worshippers of beasts, and the worshippers of the one only God of natural religion; among the Jews, the carnal, and the spiritual, who were the Christians of the old law; among Christians, the coarser-minded, who are the Jews of the new law. 
 608 每种宗教都有两种人：异教徒中，野兽的崇拜者，以及自然宗教中独一神的崇拜者。在犹太人中，无论是属肉体的还是属灵的，他们都是旧律法的基督徒；在基督徒中，心智粗俗的人是新律法的犹太人。
The carnal Jews looked for a carnal Messiah; the coarser Christians believe that the Messiah has dispensed them from the love of God; true Jews and true Christians worship a Messiah who makes them love God. 
属肉体的犹太人寻找属肉体的弥赛亚。粗俗的基督徒相信弥赛亚已经使他们脱离了上帝的爱。真正的犹太人和真正的基督徒崇拜使他们爱上帝的弥赛亚。
  609  _To show that the true Jews and the true Christians have but the same religion._--The religion of the Jews seemed to consist essentially in the fatherhood of Abraham, in circumcision, in sacrifices, in ceremonies, in the Ark, in the temple, in Jerusalem, and, finally, in the law, and in the covenant with Moses. 
 609_为了表明真正的犹太人和真正的基督徒拥有相同的宗教。_-犹太人的宗教似乎主要在于亚伯拉罕的父亲身份、割礼、献祭、仪式、方舟、圣殿，耶路撒冷，最后是律法，以及与摩西所立的约。
 I say that it consisted in none of those things, but only in the love of God, and that God disregarded all the other things. 
我说，它不在于这些事情，而只在于神的爱，而神不考虑其他的一切。
 That God did not accept the posterity of Abraham. 
神不接受亚伯拉罕的后裔。
 That the Jews were to be punished like strangers, if they transgressed. 
如果犹太人违法，他们将像陌生人一样受到惩罚。
"_Deut._ viii, 19; ""If thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other gods, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish, as the nations which the Lord destroyeth before your face.""  That strangers, if they loved God, were to be received by Him as the Jews. "
_申命_八、19； “如果你忘记耶和华你的神，而随从别神，我今日向你作见证，你们必要灭亡，正如耶和华在你们面前所灭亡的列国一样。”外邦人如果爱神，就会像犹太人一样被神接纳。
"_Isaiah_ lvi, 3: ""Let not the stranger say, 'The Lord will not receive me.' The strangers who join themselves unto the Lord to serve Him and love Him, will I bring unto my holy mountain, and accept therein sacrifices, for mine house is a house of prayer.""  That the true Jews considered their merit to be from God only, and not from Abraham. "
 《以赛亚书》第 3 章：“不容外人说：‘耶和华不接待我。’”我将带那些与主联合、事奉他、爱他的外邦人到我的圣山，并在其中接受祭祀，因为我的殿是祷告的殿。”真正的犹太人认为他们的功绩仅来自上帝，而不是来自亚伯拉罕。
"_Isaiah_ lxiii, 16; ""Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not. "
 《以赛亚书》lxiii，16； “毫无疑问，你是我们的父亲，尽管亚伯拉罕不认识我们，以色列也不承认我们。
"Thou art our Father and our Redeemer.""  Moses himself told them that God would not accept persons. "
你是我们的父，我们的救赎主。”摩西亲自告诉他们，神不会接纳任何人。
"_Deut._ x, 17: ""God,"" said he, ""regardeth neither persons nor sacrifices.""  The Sabbath was only a sign, _Exod._ xxxi, 13; and in memory of the escape from Egypt, _Deut._ v, 19. "
_Deut._ x, 17：“上帝，”他说，“既不关心人，也不关心牺牲。”安息日只是一个记号，_Exod._ xxxi, 13;并为纪念逃离埃及，《申命记》第 5 章，19 节。
Therefore it is no longer necessary, since Egypt must be forgotten. 
因此，它不再是必要的，因为埃及必须被遗忘。
 Circumcision was only a sign, _Gen._ xvii, 11. 
割礼只是一个标志，_Gen._ xvii，11。
And thence it came to pass that, being in the desert, they were not circumcised because they could not be confounded with other peoples; and after Jesus Christ came, it was no longer necessary. 
事情是这样的，在沙漠中，他们没有受割礼，因为他们不能与其他民族相混淆。耶稣基督来了之后，就不再需要了。
 That the circumcision of the heart is commanded. 
心灵的割礼是受命令的。
"_Deut._ x, 16; _Jeremiah_ iv, 4: ""Be ye circumcised in heart; take away the superfluities of your heart, and harden yourselves not. "
 _申命_ x, 16;耶利米书四章 4 节：“你们心里要受割礼；除去你们心里多余的东西，不可硬着心。
"For your God is a mighty God, strong and terrible, who accepteth not persons.""  That God said He would one day do it. "
因为你们的神是一位强大而可怕的神，他不接受任何人。”神说他有一天会这样做。
"_Deut._ xxx, 6; ""God will circumcise thine heart, and the heart of thy seed, that thou mayest love Him with all thine heart.""  That the uncircumcised in heart shall be judged. "
_申._ xxx, 6; “神要给你的心和你后裔的心行割礼，这样你就可以全心全意地爱他。”使心里未受割礼的人受到审判。
"_Jeremiah_ ix, 26: For God will judge the uncircumcised peoples, and all the people of Israel, because he is ""uncircumcised in heart.""  That the external is of no avail apart from the internal. "
耶利米书九章 26 节：上帝要审判未受割礼的人民和以色列全体人民，因为他“心里未受割礼”。离开了内在，外在是没有任何用处的。
_Joel_ ii, 13: _Scindite corda vestra_, etc.; _Isaiah_ lviii, 3, 4, etc. 
 _Joel_ ii, 13：_Scindite corda Vestra_ 等； _以赛亚书_lviii、3、4 等
 The love of God is enjoined in the whole of Deuteronomy. 
整本申命记都吩咐神的爱。
"_Deut._ xxx, 19: ""I call heaven and earth to record that I have set before you life and death, that you should choose life, and love God, and obey Him, for God is your life.""  That the Jews, for lack of that love, should be rejected for their offences, and the heathen chosen in their stead. "
 _Deut._ xxx, 19: “我呼天唤地来记录，我已将生与死摆在你们面前，叫你们选择生命，爱神，顺服神，因为神就是你们的生命。”犹太人由于缺乏这种爱，应该因他们的罪行而被拒绝，并选择异教徒来代替他们。

  610  _Republic._--The Christian republic--and even the Jewish--has only had God for ruler, as Philo the Jew notices, _On Monarchy_. 
 610_共和国。_——基督教共和国——甚至是犹太共和国——只有上帝作为统治者，正如犹太人斐罗在《论君主制》中所注意到的那样。
 When they fought, it was for God only; their chief hope was in God only; they considered their towns as belonging to God only, and kept them for God.

_Statuam pactum meum inter me et te fœdere sempiterno ... 
 _Statuam pactum meum inter me et te fœdere sempiterno ...
ut sim Deus tuus...._  _Et tu ergo custodies pactum meum._   612  _Perpetuity._--That religion has always existed on earth, which consists in believing that man has fallen from a state of glory and of communion with God into a state of sorrow, penitence, and estrangement from God, but that after this life we shall be restored by a Messiah who should have come. 
 ut sim Deus tuus...._ _Et tu ergo custodies pactum meum._ 612 _Perpetuity._--宗教一直存在于地球上，它相信人类已经从荣耀和与上帝相交的状态堕落到一种悲伤、悔罪和与上帝疏远的状态，但在今生之后，我们将被应该到来的弥赛亚恢复。
All things have passed away, and this has endured, for which all things are. 
一切都已过去，而这一切却一直存在，为之而存在。
 Men have in the first age of the world been carried away into every kind of debauchery, and yet there were saints, as Enoch, Lamech, and others, who waited patiently for the Christ promised from the beginning of the world. 
在创世的第一个时代，人类已经陷入了各种放荡的境地，但仍然有圣徒，如以诺、拉麦和其他人，耐心地等待着从创世以来所应许的基督。
Noah saw the wickedness of men at its height; and he was held worthy to save the world in his person, by the hope of the Messiah of whom he was the type. 
诺亚看到了人类的邪恶达到了顶峰。他被认为有资格亲自拯救世界，因为他是弥赛亚的预表。
"Abraham was surrounded by idolaters, when God made known to him the mystery of the Messiah, whom he welcomed from afar.[219] In the time of Isaac and Jacob abomination was spread over all the earth; but these saints lived in faith; and Jacob, dying and blessing his children, cried in a transport which made him break off his discourse, ""I await, O my God, the Saviour whom Thou hast promised. "
当神向亚伯拉罕显明弥赛亚的奥秘时，亚伯拉罕被偶像崇拜者包围，他从远方欢迎弥赛亚。 [219]在以撒和雅各的时代，可憎之事遍及全地。但这些圣徒都生活在信仰之中；雅各在临终前为他的孩子们祝福时，激动地哭喊着，这使他中断了演讲：“我的上帝啊，我等待着你所应许的救世主。
"_Salutare taum expectabo, Domine._""[220] The Egyptians were infected both with idolatry and magic; the very people of God were led astray by their example. "
"_Salutare taum Expectabo, Domine._""[220] 埃及人受到偶像崇拜和魔法的感染；上帝的子民被他们的榜样引入了歧途。"
Yet Moses and others believed Him whom they saw not, and worshipped Him, looking to the eternal gifts which He was preparing for them. 
然而摩西和其他人相信他们看不见的他，并敬拜他，期待他为他们准备的永恒礼物。
 The Greeks and Latins then set up false deities; the poets made a hundred different theologies, while the philosophers separated into a thousand different sects; and yet in the heart of Judæa there were always chosen men who foretold the coming of this Messiah, which was known to them alone. 
随后，希腊人和拉丁人树立了虚假的神灵。诗人提出了一百种不同的神学，而哲学家则分成了一千种不同的流派。然而，在犹太的中心地带，总是有一些被选中的人预言了只有他们自己知道的弥赛亚的到来。
 He came at length in the fullness of time, and time has since witnessed the birth of so many schisms and heresies, so many political revolutions, so many changes in all things; yet this Church, which worships Him who has always been worshipped, has endured uninterruptedly. 
他终于在时机成熟时到来，从那时起，时间见证了如此多的分裂和异端的诞生，如此多的政治革命，如此多的万物变化；然而，这个敬拜那始终受人敬拜的教会却一直不间断地存在着。
It is a wonderful, incomparable, and altogether divine fact that this religion, which has always endured, has always been attacked. 
这个历久不衰的宗教却一直受到攻击，这是一个奇妙的、无与伦比的、完全神圣的事实。
It has been a thousand times on the eve of universal destruction, and every time it has been in that state, God has restored it by extraordinary acts of His power. 
在普遍毁灭的前夕，已经有上千次了，而每次处于这种状态时，上帝都会通过他非凡的力量来恢复它。
This is astonishing, as also that it has preserved itself without yielding to the will of tyrants. 
这是令人惊讶的，因为它在没有屈服于暴君意志的情况下保存了自己。
For it is not strange that a State endures, when its laws are sometimes made to give way to necessity, but that ... 
因为当一个国家的法律有时被制定为迫不得已时，一个国家的存在并不奇怪，但……
(See the passage indicated in Montaigne.)   613  States would perish if they did not often make their laws give way to necessity. 
 （见蒙田指出的段落。）613 如果国家不经常让其法律屈服于必要性，国家就会灭亡。
But religion has never suffered this, or practised it. 
但宗教从未遭受过这种痛苦，也从未实践过这种做法。
Indeed, there must be these compromises, or miracles. 
确实，必须有这些妥协，或者奇迹。
It is not strange to be saved by yieldings, and this is not strictly self-preservation; besides, in the end they perish entirely. 
通过屈服而得救并不奇怪，这并不是严格意义上的自我保护；而且，最终他们都会彻底灭亡。
None has endured a thousand years. 
没有人能够忍受一千年。
But the fact that this religion has always maintained itself, inflexible as it is, proves its divinity. 
但这个宗教始终坚持自己的立场，顽固不化，这一事实证明了它的神性。
  614  Whatever may be said, it must be admitted that the Christian religion has something astonishing in it. 
 614 不管怎么说，必须承认基督教有一些令人惊奇的东西。
"Some will say, ""This is because you were born in it."" Far from it; I stiffen myself against it for this very reason, for fear this prejudice bias me. "
有人会说：“这是因为你出生在其中。”离得很远;正是因为这个原因，我才坚决反对它，因为担心这种偏见会让我产生偏见。
But although I am born in it, I cannot help finding it so. 
但尽管我生在其中，我还是情不自禁地发现了这一点。
  615  _Perpetuity._--The Messiah has always been believed in. 
 615 _Perpetuity._--弥赛亚一直被相信。
The tradition from Adam was fresh in Noah and in Moses. 
亚当的传统在诺亚和摩西那里依然新鲜。
Since then the prophets have foretold him, while at the same time foretelling other things, which, being from time to time fulfilled in the sight of men, showed the truth of their mission, and consequently that of their promises touching the Messiah. 
从那时起，先知们在预言他的同时，也预言了其他事情，这些事情不时地在人们的眼前应验，表明了他们使命的真实性，从而表明了他们对弥赛亚的应许的真实性。
Jesus Christ performed miracles, and the Apostles also, who converted all the heathen; and all the prophecies being thereby fulfilled, the Messiah is for ever proved. 
耶稣基督创造了奇迹，使徒们也创造了奇迹，他们改变了所有的异教徒。所有的预言都因此得到应验，弥赛亚也得到了永远的证实。
  616  _Perpetuity._--Let us consider that since the beginning of the world the expectation of worship of the Messiah has existed uninterruptedly; that there have been found men, who said that God had revealed to them that a Redeemer was to be born, who should save His people; that Abraham came afterwards, saying that he had had a revelation that the Messiah was to spring from him by a son, whom he should have; that Jacob declared that, of his twelve sons, the Messiah would spring from Judah; that Moses and the prophets then came to declare the time and the manner of His coming; that they said their law was only temporary till that of the Messiah, that it should endure till then, but that the other should last for ever; that thus either their law, or that of the Messiah, of which it was the promise, would be always upon the earth; that, in fact, it has always endured; that at last Jesus Christ came with all the circumstances foretold. 
616_永久._--让我们考虑一下，自世界诞生以来，对弥赛亚的崇拜的期望就一直不间断地存在；有人发现有人说上帝已向他们启示一位救赎主即将诞生，他将拯救他的子民；后来亚伯拉罕来了，说他得到了启示，弥赛亚将由他生下一个儿子，他应该有这个儿子。雅各宣称，在他的十二个儿子中，弥赛亚将从犹大产生；摩西和先知们随后来宣告他降临的时间和方式；他们说他们的律法只是暂时的，直到弥赛亚的律法出现为止，它应该持续到那时，但另一个律法应该永远持续；因此，要么他们的律法，要么弥赛亚的律法（其应许）将永远存在于地球上。事实上，它一直存在；最后耶稣基督带着所预言的一切情况来到了。
This is wonderful. 
这太棒了。
  617  This is positive fact. 
 617 这是积极的事实。
While all philosophers separate into different sects, there is found in one corner of the world the most ancient people in it, declaring that all the world is in error, that God has revealed to them the truth, that they will always exist on the earth. 
虽然所有哲学家都分成不同的教派，但在世界的某个角落却发现了最古老的人，他们宣称全世界都是错误的，上帝向他们揭示了真理，他们将永远存在于地球上。
In fact, all other sects come to an end, this one still endures, and has done so for four thousand years. 
事实上，其他宗派都灭亡了，唯独这一派还存在，而且已经存在了四千年。
 They declare that they hold from their ancestors that man has fallen from communion with God, and is entirely estranged from God, but that He has promised to redeem them; that this doctrine shall always exist on the earth; that their law has a double signification; that during sixteen hundred years they have had people, whom they believed prophets, foretelling both the time and the manner; that four hundred years after they were scattered everywhere, because Jesus Christ was to be everywhere announced; that Jesus Christ came in the manner, and at the time foretold; that the Jews have since been scattered abroad under a curse, and nevertheless still exist. 
他们宣称，他们从祖先那里就认为，人类已经脱离了与上帝的相交，并且完全与上帝疏远了，但上帝却应许要救赎他们；这一学说将永远存在于地球上；他们的法律具有双重意义；一千六百年以来，他们相信有人是预言时间和方式的先知。四百年后，他们分散到各地，因为耶稣基督要被传遍各处；耶稣基督以预言的方式和时间降临；犹太人在诅咒下被驱散到国外，但仍然存在。
  618  I see the Christian religion founded upon a preceding religion, and this is what I find as a fact. 
 618 我看到基督教是建立在先前宗教的基础上的，这就是我发现的事实。
 I do not here speak of the miracles of Moses, of Jesus Christ, and of the Apostles, because they do not at first seem convincing, and because I only wish here to put in evidence all those foundations of the Christian religion which are beyond doubt, and which cannot be called in question by any person whatsoever. 
我在这里不谈论摩西、耶稣基督和使徒的神迹，因为它们乍一看似乎并不令人信服，而且因为我只想在这里将基督教的所有那些不容置疑的基础作为证据。 ，任何人都不能对此提出质疑。
It is certain that we see in many places of the world a peculiar people, separated from all other peoples of the world, and called the Jewish people. 
可以肯定的是，我们在世界许多地方看到了一个特殊的民族，与世界上所有其他民族分开，被称为犹太人。
 I see then a crowd of religions in many parts of the world and in all times; but their morality cannot please me, nor can their proofs convince me. 
于是我看到世界上许多地方、各个时代都有大量的宗教。但他们的道德不能令我满意，他们的证据也不能令我信服。
Thus I should equally have rejected the religion of Mahomet and of China, of the ancient Romans and of the Egyptians, for the sole reason, that none having more marks of truth than another, nor anything which should necessarily persuade me, reason cannot incline to one rather than the other. 
因此，我同样应该拒绝穆罕默德的宗教和中国的宗教，古罗马人和埃及人的宗教，唯一的原因是，没有一个人比另一个人拥有更多的真理标志，也没有任何必然说服我的东西，理性不能倾向于一个而不是另一个。
 But, in thus considering this changeable and singular variety of morals and beliefs at different times, I find in one corner of the world a peculiar people, separated from all other peoples on earth, the most ancient of all, and whose histories are earlier by many generations than the most ancient which we possess. 
但是，在考虑不同时期道德和信仰的这种多变且独特的多样性时，我发现在世界的一个角落有一个特殊的民族，与地球上所有其他民族分开，是所有民族中最古老的，其历史更早于比我们拥有的最古老的世代还要多代。
 I find, then, this great and numerous people, sprung from a single man, who worship one God, and guide themselves by a law which they say that they obtained from His own hand. 
那么，我发现这个伟大而众多的民族，都是由一个人产生的，他们敬拜一位上帝，并以他们自称从上帝手中获得的法律来指导自己。
They maintain that they are the only people in the world to whom God has revealed His mysteries; that all men are corrupt and in disgrace with God; that they are all abandoned to their senses and their own imagination, whence come the strange errors and continual changes which happen among them, both of religions and of morals, whereas they themselves remain firm in their conduct; but that God will not leave other nations in this darkness for ever; that there will come a Saviour for all; that they are in the world to announce Him to men; that they are expressly formed to be forerunners and heralds of this great event, and to summon all nations to join with them in the expectation of this Saviour. 
他们坚称，他们是世界上唯一上帝向他们揭示了他的奥秘的人。所有人都是败坏的，都羞辱了上帝；他们都被自己的感官和想象力所抛弃，因此他们中间发生了宗教和道德上的奇怪错误和不断的变化，而他们自己却在行为上保持坚定；但上帝不会让其他国家永远处于这种黑暗之中；所有人的救世主都会到来；他们来到世上是为了向人们宣扬他；他们被明确地塑造为这一伟大事件的先驱和先驱，并召唤所有国家与他们一起期待这位救主。
 To meet with this people is astonishing to me, and seems to me worthy of attention. 
与这些人见面让我感到惊讶，并且在我看来值得关注。
I look at the law which they boast of having obtained from God, and I find it admirable. 
我看着他们夸口从上帝那里得到的法律，我觉得这是令人钦佩的。
It is the first law of all, and is of such a kind that, even before the term _law_ was in currency among the Greeks, it had, for nearly a thousand years earlier, been uninterruptedly accepted and observed by the Jews. 
它是所有法律中的第一条法律，甚至在“法律”一词在希腊人中流行之前，它就已在近一千年前被犹太人不间断地接受和遵守。
I likewise think it strange that the first law of the world happens to be the most perfect; so that the greatest legislators have borrowed their laws from it, as is apparent from the law of the Twelve Tables at Athens,[221] afterwards taken by the Romans, and as it would be easy to prove, if Josephus[222] and others had not sufficiently dealt with this subject. 
我同样觉得奇怪的是，世界第一定律恰好是最完美的；因此，最伟大的立法者都从中借用了他们的法律，正如雅典十二铜表法[221]后来被罗马人采用的那样，并且很容易证明，如果约瑟夫斯[222]和其他人没有充分处理这个问题。
  619  _Advantages of the Jewish people._--In this search the Jewish people at once attracts my attention by the number of wonderful and singular facts which appear about them. 
 619 _犹太人的优点。_--在这一研究中，犹太人立即引起了我的注意，因为他们身上出现了许多奇妙而独特的事实。
 I first see that they are a people wholly composed of brethren, and whereas all others are formed by the assemblage of an infinity of families, this, though so wonderfully fruitful, has all sprung from one man alone, and, being thus all one flesh, and members one of another, they constitute a powerful state of one family. 
我首先看到他们是一个完全由兄弟组成的民族，而所有其他民族都是由无数家庭的集合组成的，而这个民族虽然结出如此奇妙的果实，却全都是从一个人身上产生的，因此都是一个血肉之躯。 ，和一个个成员，他们构成了一个家族的强大国家。
This is unique. 
这是独一无二的。
 This family, or people, is the most ancient within human knowledge, a fact which seems to me to inspire a peculiar veneration for it, especially in view of our present inquiry; since if God had from all time revealed Himself to men, it is to these we must turn for knowledge of the tradition. 
这个家庭或民族是人类知识中最古老的，在我看来，这一事实激发了人们对它的特殊崇拜，特别是考虑到我们目前的探究；因为如果上帝自始至终都向人类启示过自己，那么我们就必须向人类寻求有关传统的知识。
 This people is not eminent solely by their antiquity, but is also singular by their duration, which has always continued from their origin till now. 
这个民族不仅因其古老而出名，而且因其历史悠久而独特，从他们的起源一直延续到现在。
For whereas the nations of Greece and of Italy, of Lacedæmon, of Athens and of Rome, and others who came long after, have long since perished, these ever remain, and in spite of the endeavours of many powerful kings who have a hundred times tried to destroy them, as their historians testify, and as it is easy to conjecture from the natural order of things during so long a space of years, they have nevertheless been preserved (and this preservation has been foretold); and extending from the earliest times to the latest, their history comprehends in its duration all our histories [which it preceded by a long time]. 
因为尽管希腊、意大利、拉栖代梦、雅典和罗马以及其他后来出现的国家早已灭亡，但这些国家却永远存在，尽管许多强大的国王曾一百次努力，但这些国家却永远存在。正如它们的历史学家所证明的那样，它们试图摧毁它们，而且从如此漫长的岁月里事物的自然秩序很容易推测出，它们仍然被保存下来（而且这种保存已经被预言过）；从最早的时代一直延伸到最近的时代，他们的历史涵盖了我们所有的历史（它早于很长一段时间）。
 The law by which this people is governed is at once the most ancient law in the world, the most perfect, and the only one which has been always observed without a break in a state. 
统治这个民族的法律是世界上最古老、最完善的法律，也是唯一一个国家始终遵守的法律。
This is what Josephus admirably proves, _against Apion_,[223] and also Philo[224] the Jew, in different places, where they point out that it is so ancient that the very name of _law_ was only known by the oldest nation more than a thousand years afterwards; so that Homer, who has written the history of so many states, has never used the term. 
这就是约瑟夫斯令人钦佩地证明的，_反对阿皮翁_，[223]以及犹太人斐洛[224]，在不同的地方，他们指出它是如此古老，以至于_法律_的名字只有最古老的民族知道超过一千年之后；因此，荷马虽然写下了如此多的国家的历史，却从未使用过这个词。
And it is easy to judge of its perfection by simply reading it; for we see that it has provided for all things with so great wisdom, equity, and judgment, that the most ancient legislators, Greek and Roman, having had some knowledge of it, have borrowed from it their principal laws; this is evident from what are called the Twelve Tables, and from the other proofs which Josephus gives. 
只要阅读它，就很容易判断它的完美程度；因为我们看到，它以如此伟大的智慧、公平和判断力为一切事物提供了规定，以至于最古老的立法者，无论是希腊还是罗马，都对它有一定的了解，并从它那里借用了他们的主要法律。这从所谓的《十二铜表》以及约瑟夫斯给出的其他证据中可以明显看出。
 But this law is at the same time the severest and strictest of all in respect to their religious worship, imposing on this people, in order to keep them to their duty, a thousand peculiar and painful observances, on pain of death. 
但与此同时，这项法律对于他们的宗教崇拜来说也是最严厉和最严格的，为了让他们恪尽职守，它强加给这个民族一千种奇特而痛苦的仪式，违者处以死刑。
Whence it is very astonishing that it has been constantly preserved during many centuries by a people, rebellious and impatient as this one was; while all other states have changed their laws from time to time, although these were far more lenient. 
令人非常惊讶的是，几个世纪以来，它一直被一个像这个人一样叛逆而缺乏耐心的民族保存着。而所有其他州都时不时地改变他们的法律，尽管这些法律要宽松得多。
 The book which contains this law, the first of all, is itself the most ancient book in the world, those of Homer, Hesiod, and others, being six or seven hundred years later. 
首先，包含这条法则的书本身就是世界上最古老的书，荷马、赫西奥德等人的书是六七百年后的。
  620  The creation and the deluge being past, and God no longer requiring to destroy the world, nor to create it anew, nor to give such great signs of Himself, He began to establish a people on the earth, purposely formed, who were to last until the coming of the people whom the Messiah should fashion by His spirit. 
 620 创造和洪水已经过去，上帝不再要求毁灭世界，也不再要求重新创造世界，也不再要求给予自己如此伟大的迹象，他开始在地球上建立一个有意形成的民族，他们将一直持续到弥赛亚用他的灵塑造的子民到来。
  621  The creation of the world beginning to be distant, God provided a single contemporary historian, and appointed a whole people as guardians of this book, in order that this history might be the most authentic in the world, and that all men might thereby learn a fact so necessary to know, and which could only be known through that means. 
621 创世之日开始遥远，上帝赐予了一位同时代的历史学家，并指定了全民作为这本书的守护者，使这部历史成为世界上最真实的历史，让所有人都可以学习这是一个非常有必要知道的事实，而且只能通过这种方式才能知道。
  622  [Japhet begins the genealogy.]  Joseph folds his arms, and prefers the younger.[225]   623  Why should Moses make the lives of men so long, and their generations so few?  Because it is not the length of years, but the multitude of generations, which renders things obscure. 
 622 [雅弗开始家谱。]约瑟夫抱起双臂，更喜欢年轻的。[225]第 623 章 为什么摩西要使人的生命如此长久，而他们的世代却如此短暂？因为使事物变得模糊的不是岁月的长短，而是世代的众多。
For truth is perverted only by the change of men. 
因为真理只会因人的改变而被歪曲。
And yet he puts two things, the most memorable that were ever imagined, namely, the creation and the deluge, so near that we reach from one to the other. 
然而，他却把人类想象中最令人难忘的两件事，即创造和洪水，放在如此接近的地方，以至于我们可以从一件事到达另一件事。
  624  Shem, who saw Lamech, who saw Adam, saw also Jacob, who saw those who saw Moses; therefore the deluge and the creation are true. 
 624 闪看见了拉麦，拉麦看见了亚当，也看见了雅各，雅各看见了摩西；因此，洪水和创造都是真实的。
This is conclusive among certain people who understand it rightly. 
这是某些正确理解的人得出的结论。
  625  The longevity of the patriarchs, instead of causing the loss of past history, conduced, on the contrary, to its preservation. 
 625 族长的长寿不但没有导致过去历史的消失，反而有助于它的保存。
For the reason why we are sometimes insufficiently instructed in the history of our ancestors, is that we have never lived long with them, and that they are often dead before we have attained the age of reason. 
我们有时对祖先的历史了解不够，是因为我们与他们一起生活的时间不长，而他们常常在我们达到理性年龄之前就去世了。
Now, when men lived so long, children lived long with their parents. 
现在，当男人活得很长的时候，孩子们和父母一起活得很长。
They conversed long with them. 
与他们进行了长时间的交谈。
But what else could be the subject of their talk save the history of their ancestors, since to that all history was reduced, and men did not study science or art, which now form a large part of daily conversation? We see also that in these days tribes took particular care to preserve their genealogies. 
但是，除了他们祖先的历史之外，他们还能谈论什么，因为所有的历史都被简化了，人们不学习科学或艺术，而科学或艺术现在已成为日常谈话的重要组成部分？我们还看到，如今部落特别注意保存他们的家谱。
  626  I believe that Joshua was the first of God's people to have this name, as Jesus Christ was the last of God's people. 
 626 我相信约书亚是第一个拥有这个名字的上帝子民，正如耶稣基督是最后一个上帝子民一样。
  627  _Antiquity of the Jews._--What a difference there is between one book and another! I am not astonished that the Greeks made the Iliad, nor the Egyptians and the Chinese their histories. 
第627章_犹太人的古代。_--一本书和另一本书之间有多么不同！对于希腊人创造了《伊利亚特》，埃及人和中国人创造了他们的历史，我并不感到惊讶。
 We have only to see how this originates. 
我们只需看看这是如何起源的。
These fabulous historians are not contemporaneous with the facts about which they write. 
这些神话般的历史学家与他们所写的事实并不同时发生。
Homer composes a romance, which he gives out as such, and which is received as such; for nobody doubted that Troy and Agamemnon no more existed than did the golden apple. 
荷马创作了一部浪漫小说，他以这样的形式发表，也以这样的形式被接受。因为没有人怀疑特洛伊和阿伽门农就像金苹果一样不存在。
Accordingly he did not think of making a history, but solely a book to amuse; he is the only writer of his time; the beauty of the work has made it last, every one learns it and talks of it, it is necessary to know it, and each one knows it by heart. 
因此，他并没有想到要创造历史，而只是想写一本供娱乐的书。他是他那个时代唯一的作家；作品之美使其历久弥新，人人都学它、谈论它，有必要认识它，人人都熟记于心。
Four hundred years afterwards the witnesses of these facts are no longer alive, no one knows of his own knowledge if it be a fable or a history; one has only learnt it from his ancestors, and this can pass for truth. 
四百年后，这些事实的见证者已不复存在，没有人知道他自己的知识是寓言还是历史；这是从他的祖先那里学到的，这可以被认为是真理。
 Every history which is not contemporaneous, as the books of the Sibyls and Trismegistus,[226] and so many others which have been believed by the world, are false, and found to be false in the course of time. 
所有非同时代的历史，如《女西比尔》和《特里斯墨吉斯托斯》[226] 以及许多其他被世人相信的书籍，都是虚假的，并且随着时间的推移被发现是虚假的。
It is not so with contemporaneous writers. 
但同时代的作家却并非如此。
 There is a great difference between a book which an individual writes, and publishes to a nation, and a book which itself creates a nation. 
个人撰写并出版给一个国家的一本书与一本本身创造了一个国家的书之间有很大的区别。
We cannot doubt that the book is as old as the people. 
我们不能怀疑这本书和人们一样古老。
  628  Josephus hides the shame of his nation. 
 628 约瑟夫斯隐藏了他国家的耻辱。
 Moses does not hide his own shame. 
摩西并不掩饰自己的耻辱。
 _Quis mihi det ut omnes prophetent?_[227]  He was weary of the multitude. 
 _Quis mihi det ut omnes先知？_[227] 他厌倦了众人。
  629  _The sincerity of the Jews._--Maccabees,[228] after they had no more prophets; the Masorah, since Jesus Christ. 
 629_犹太人的真诚。_-马加比，[228]在他们不再有先知之后；马索拉，自耶稣基督以来。
 This book will be a testimony for you.[229]  Defective and final letters. 
这本书将成为你的见证。[229]有缺陷的和最终的信件。
 Sincere against their honour, and dying for it; this has no example in the world, and no root in nature. 
真诚地反对他们的荣誉，并为之而死；这在世界上没有先例，在自然界中也没有根源。
  630  _Sincerity of the Jews._--They preserve lovingly and carefully the book in which Moses declares that they have been all their life ungrateful to God, and that he knows they will be still more so after his death; but that he calls heaven and earth to witness against them, and that he has [_taught_] them enough. 
630_犹太人的真诚。_--他们亲切而仔细地保存着这本书，在这本书中，摩西宣称他们一生都对上帝忘恩负义，而他知道他们在他死后将更加如此；但他呼天唤地来作证反对他们，并且他已经[_教导_]他们足够了。
 He declares that God, being angry with them, shall at last scatter them among all the nations of the earth; that as they have offended Him by worshipping gods who were not their God, so He will provoke them by calling a people who are not His people; that He desires that all His words be preserved for ever, and that His book be placed in the Ark of the Covenant to serve for ever as a witness against them. 
他宣称，上帝对他们发怒，最终将把他们分散在地球上的所有国家中。正如他们因敬拜非他们的神而冒犯了他一样，他也会因呼召非他子民的人民而激怒他们；他希望他所有的话语都被永远保存，并且他的书被放置在约柜中，永远作为反对他们的见证。

"  631  _On Esdras._--The story that the books were burnt with the temple proved false by Maccabees: ""Jeremiah gave them the law.""  The story that he recited the whole by heart. "
 631_论埃斯德拉斯._-马卡比证明书籍与圣殿一起被烧毁的故事是错误的：“耶利米给了他们律法。”他把这个故事全部背诵了出来。

 Philo, _in Vita Moysis: Illa lingua ac character quo antiquitus scripta est lex sic permansit usque ad LXX._  Josephus says that the Law was in Hebrew when it was translated by the Seventy. 
斐洛，_in Vita Moysis：Illa lingua ac character quo antiquitus scripta est lex sic permansit usque ad LXX._约瑟夫斯说，当七十人翻译时，律法是希伯来语。
 Under Antiochus and Vespasian, when they wanted to abolish the books, and when there was no prophet, they could not do so. 
在安条克和维斯帕芗的统治下，当他们想要废除经书，并且没有先知时，他们无法这样做。
And under the Babylonians, when no persecution had been made, and when there were so many prophets, would they have let them be burnt?  Josephus laughs at the Greeks who would not bear ... 
在巴比伦人统治下，当没有进行迫害，当有这么多先知时，他们会让他们被烧死吗？约瑟夫斯嘲笑那些不愿忍受的希腊人......
 Tertullian.[230]--_Perinde potuit abolefactam eam violentia cataclysmi in spiritu rursus reformare, quemadmodum et Hierosolymis Babylonia expugnatione deletis, omne instrumentum Judaicæ literaturæ per Esdram constat restauratum._  He says that Noah could as easily have restored in spirit the book of Enoch, destroyed by the Deluge, as Esdras could have restored the Scriptures lost during the Captivity. 
德尔图良 (Tertullian) 被大洪水摧毁，因为埃斯德拉斯 (Esdras) 可以恢复被囚禁期间丢失的圣经。
 (Θεὸς) ἐν τῆ ἐπὶ Ναβουχοδόνοσορ αἰχμαλωία τοῦ λαοῦ, διαφθαρεισῶν τῶν γραφῶν ... 
 (θεὸς) ἐν τῆ ἐπὶ Ναβουχοδονοσορ αἰχμαλωία τοῦ λαοῦ, διαφθαρεισῶν τῶν γραφῶν ...
ἐνέπνευσε Εσδρᾷ τῶ ἱερεἱ ἐκ τῆς φυλῆς Λευὶ τοῦς τῶν προγεγονότων προφητῶν πάντας ἀνατάξασθαι λόγους, και ἀποκαταστῆσαι τῲ λαω τὴν διὰ Μωυσέως νομοθίαν.[231] He alleges this to prove that it is not incredible that the Seventy may have explained the holy Scriptures with that uniformity which we admire in them. 
启发古代先知利未部落的祭司埃斯德拉恢复所有的话语，并向人民恢复摩西的律法。 [231]他声称这一点是为了证明七十人以我们所钦佩的统一性解释了圣经，这并不令人难以置信。
And he took that from Saint Irenæus.[232]  Saint Hilary, in his preface to the Psalms, says that Esdras arranged the Psalms in order. 
他从圣爱任纽那里继承了这一点。[232]圣希拉里在他的《诗篇》序言中说，埃斯德拉斯按顺序排列了《诗篇》。
 The origin of this tradition comes from the 14th chapter of the fourth book of Esdras. 
这个传统的起源来自艾斯德拉斯第四本书第14章。
_Deus glorificatus est, et Scripturæ vere divinæ creditæ sunt, omnibus eandem et eisdem verbis et eisdem nominibus recitantibus ab initio usque ad finem, uti et præsentes gentes cognoscerent quoniam per inspirationem Dei interpretatæ sunt Scripturæ, et non esset mirabile Deum hoc in eis operatum: quando in ea captivitate populi quæ facta est a Nabuchodonosor, corruptis scripturis et post 70 annos Judæis descendentibus in regionem suam, et post deinde temporibus Artaxerxis Persarum regis, inspiravit Esdræ sacerdoti tribus Levi præteritorum prophetarum omnes rememorare sermones, et restituere populo eam legem quæ data est per Moysen._   632  _Against the story in Esdras, 2 Maccab._ ii;--Josephus, _Antiquities_, II, i--Cyrus took occasion from the prophecy of Isaiah to release the people. 
_上帝得到了荣耀，圣经被认为是真正神圣的，所有人从头到尾都背诵着相同的词语和相同的名字，以便当今各国都知道圣经是由上帝的默示解释的。上帝啊，上帝在他们身上做了这件事，这不是很奇妙吗：当尼布甲尼撒带着被讹误的经文对人民进行囚禁时，在犹太人来到他们的国家70年后，在那之后在波斯国王阿尔塔薛西斯时代，他激励利未部落的祭司埃斯德拉记住过去先知的所有话语，并向人民恢复摩西所颁布的律法。 632_反对埃斯德拉斯的故事，2 Maccab._ ii;-约瑟夫斯，_古物_，II，i-居鲁士借以赛亚预言的机会释放了人民。
The Jews held their property in peace under Cyrus in Babylon; hence they could well have the Law. 
犹太人在居鲁士统治下的巴比伦和平地保有自己的财产。因此他们很可能拥有律法。
 Josephus, in the whole history of Esdras, does not say one word about this restoration.--2 Kings xvii, 27. 
约瑟夫斯在艾斯德拉斯的整个历史中，对于这次复兴只字不提。--2 Kings xvii, 27。
  633  If the story in Esdras[233] is credible, then it must be believed that the Scripture is Holy Scripture; for this story is based only on the authority of those who assert that of the Seventy, which shows that the Scripture is holy. 
 633 如果Esdras[233]中的故事是可信的，那么就必须相信圣经是圣经；因为这个故事只是基于那些断言七十人的权威，这表明圣经是神圣的。
 Therefore if this account be true, we have what we want therein; if not, we have it elsewhere. 
因此，如果这个说法属实，那么我们就得到了我们想要的东西；如果没有，我们在其他地方也有。
And thus those who would ruin the truth of our religion, founded on Moses, establish it by the same authority by which they attack it. 
因此，那些想要破坏我们以摩西为基础的宗教真理的人，却用他们攻击宗教的同样权威来建立它。
So by this providence it still exists. 
因此，根据这个天意，它仍然存在。

 _In quacumque die._   636  _Prophecies._--The sceptre was not interrupted by the captivity in Babylon, because the return was promised and foretold. 
 _In quacumque die._ 636 _预言._-权杖没有因巴比伦的囚禁而中断，因为回归已被应许和预言。
  637  _Proofs of Jesus Christ._--Captivity, with the assurance of deliverance within seventy years, was not real captivity. 
637_耶稣基督的证据。_--俘虏，虽然有七十年内获释的保证，但并不是真正的俘虏。
But now they are captives without any hope. 
但现在他们成了俘虏，没有任何希望。
 God has promised them that even though He should scatter them to the ends of the earth, nevertheless if they were faithful to His law, He would assemble them together again. 
上帝应许他们，即使他将他们分散到天涯海角，但如果他们忠于他的律法，他就会再次将他们聚集在一起。

他们非常忠实于它，但仍然受到压迫。
  638  When Nebuchadnezzar carried away the people, for fear they should believe that the sceptre had departed from Judah, they were told beforehand that they would be there for a short time, and that they would be restored. 
 638 当尼布甲尼撒带走人民时，因为担心他们相信权杖已经离开犹大，他们事先被告知他们将在那里短暂停留，然后就会被恢复。
They were always consoled by the prophets; and their kings continued. 
他们总是受到先知的安慰。他们的国王继续说道。
But the second destruction is without promise of restoration, without prophets, without kings, without consolation, without hope, because the sceptre is taken away for ever. 
但第二次毁灭没有复兴的希望，没有先知，没有国王，没有安慰，没有希望，因为权杖被永远拿走了。
  639  It is a wonderful thing, and worthy of particular attention, to see this Jewish people existing so many years in perpetual misery, it being necessary as a proof of Jesus Christ, both that they should exist to prove Him, and that they should be miserable because they crucified Him; and though to be miserable and to exist are contradictory, they nevertheless still exist in spite of their misery. 
639 看到这个犹太人在永恒的苦难中存在了这么多年，这是一件奇妙的事情，值得特别关注，有必要作为耶稣基督的证据，他们的存在应该证明他，而且他们应该痛苦是因为他们把他钉在十字架上；尽管痛苦和存在是矛盾的，但尽管他们痛苦，但它们仍然存在。
  640  They are visibly a people expressly created to serve as a witness to the Messiah (Isaiah, xliii, 9; xliv, 8). 
 640 显然，他们是专门为弥赛亚的见证而被创造的民族（以赛亚书，xliiii，9；xliv，8）。
They keep the books, and love them, and do not understand them.

To examine the prophecies, we must understand them. 
要检验预言，我们必须理解它们。
For if we believe they have only one meaning, it is certain that the Messiah has not come; but if they have two meanings, it is certain that He has come in Jesus Christ. 
因为如果我们相信它们只有一种含义，那么弥赛亚肯定还没有到来。但如果它们有两种含义，那么可以肯定的是，他已经在耶稣基督里降临了。
 The whole problem then is to know if they have two meanings. 
那么整个问题就是要知道它们是否有两种含义。
 That the Scripture has two meanings, which Jesus Christ and the Apostles have given, is shown by the following proofs:  1.

Proof by the principles of the Rabbis, that there are two meanings; that there are two advents of the Messiah, a glorious and an humiliating one, according to their desert; that the prophets have prophesied of the Messiah only--the Law is not eternal, but must change at the coming of the Messiah--that then they shall no more remember the Red Sea; that the Jews and the Gentiles shall be mingled. 
根据拉比的原则证明，有两种含义；弥赛亚有两次降临，一次是荣耀的，一次是羞辱的，这取决于他们的应得；先知们只预言了弥赛亚——律法不是永恒的，但在弥赛亚到来时必须改变——那时他们将不再记得红海；犹太人和外邦人要混杂在一起。

The Red Sea an image of the Redemption. 
红海是救赎的形象。
_Ut sciatis quod filius hominis habet potestatem remittendi peccata, tibi dico: Surge._[235] God, wishing to show that He could form a people holy with an invisible holiness, and fill them with an eternal glory, made visible things. 
 _Ut sciatis quod filius hominis habet potestatem remittendi peccata, tibi dico: Surge._[235] 上帝希望表明他可以用看不见的圣洁来塑造一个圣洁的子民，并用永恒的荣耀充满他们，所以他使可见的事物。
As nature is an image of grace, He has done in the bounties of nature what He would do in those of grace, in order that we might judge that He could make the invisible, since He made the visible excellently. 
由于自然是恩典的形象，他已经在自然的恩赐中做了他在恩典中要做的事，以便我们可以判断他可以创造不可见的事物，因为他完美地创造了可见的事物。
 Therefore He saved this people from the deluge; He has raised them up from Abraham, redeemed them from their enemies, and set them at rest. 
因此，他从洪水中拯救了这个民族；他已将他们从亚伯拉罕手中兴起，将他们从仇敌手中救赎出来，并使他们得享安息。
 The object of God was not to save them from the deluge, and raise up a whole people from Abraham, only in order to bring them into a rich land. 
神的目的不是要拯救他们脱离洪水，并从亚伯拉罕那里兴起整个民族，只是为了把他们带入肥沃的土地。
 And even grace is only the type of glory, for it is not the ultimate end. 
甚至恩典也只是荣耀的一种形式，因为它不是最终的目的。
It has been symbolised by the law, and itself symbolises [_glory_]. 
它已被法律所象征，它本身也象征着[_荣耀_]。
But it is the type of it, and the origin or cause. 
但这就是它的类型、起源或原因。
 The ordinary life of men is like that of the saints. 
人的平凡生活就像圣人的生活一样。
They all seek their satisfaction, and differ only in the object in which they place it; they call those their enemies who hinder them, etc. 
他们都追求自己的满足，只是所追求的对象不同而已。他们称那些阻碍他们的人为敌人，等等。
God has then shown the power which He has of giving invisible blessings, by that which He has shown Himself to have over things visible. 
神通过他所拥有的超越可见事物的能力，展示了他赐予无形祝福的能力。
  643  _Types._--God, wishing to form for Himself an holy people, whom He should separate from all other nations, whom He should deliver from their enemies, and should put into a place of rest, has promised to do so, and has foretold by His prophets the time and the manner of His coming. 
643_预表_-上帝希望为自己形成一个神圣的民族，他要把他们与所有其他国家分开，他要把他们从敌人手中拯救出来，并把他们置于安息之地，他已应许这样做，并且他的先知预言了他降临的时间和方式。
And yet, to confirm the hope of His elect, He has made them see in it an image through all time, without leaving them devoid of assurances of His power and of His will to save them. 
然而，为了确认他选民的希望，他让他们在其中看到了亘古不变的形象，同时又不让他们缺乏对他拯救他们的力量和意愿的保证。
For, at the creation of man, Adam was the witness, and guardian of the promise of a Saviour, who should be born of woman, when men were still so near the creation that they could not have forgotten their creation and their fall. 
因为，在创造人类时，亚当是救世主应许的见证者和守护者，救世主应由女人所生，当时人类还如此接近创造，以至于他们不可能忘记他们的创造和堕落。
When those who had seen Adam were no longer in the world, God sent Noah whom He saved, and drowned the whole earth by a miracle which sufficiently indicated the power which He had to save the world, and the will which He had to do so, and to raise up from the seed of woman Him whom He had promised. 
当那些见过亚当的人不再在世上时，上帝派了他所拯救的诺亚，用一个奇迹淹没了整个地球，这充分表明了他拯救世界的能力和他这样做的意志，并从女人的后裔中兴起他所应许的那一位。
This miracle was enough to confirm the hope of men. 
这个奇迹足以证实人类的希望。
 The memory of the deluge being so fresh among men, while Noah was still alive, God made promises to Abraham, and, while Shem was still living, sent Moses, etc.... 
人们对大洪水的记忆如此清晰，当诺亚还活着的时候，上帝向亚伯拉罕做出了应许，当闪还活着的时候，上帝差遣了摩西，等等……
  644  _Types._--God, willing to deprive His own of perishable blessings, created the Jewish people in order to show that this was not owing to lack of power. 
 644_预表_--上帝愿意剥夺他自己的易逝的祝福，创造了犹太人，以表明这并不是由于缺乏权力。
  645  The Synagogue did not perish, because it was a type. 
 645 犹太教堂并没有灭亡，因为它是一种预表。
But because it was only a type, it fell into servitude. 
但因为它只是一种类型，所以它陷入了奴役。
The type existed till the truth came, in order that the Church should be always visible, either in the sign which promised it, or in substance. 
这种预表一直存在，直到真理出现，以便教会总是可见的，无论是在应许它的标志上，还是在实质上。

These are like the Apocalyptics.

But the difference is that they have none which are certain, so that nothing is so unjust as to claim that theirs are as well founded as some of ours; for they have none so demonstrative as some of ours. 
但不同的是，他们没有任何确定的东西，因此，声称他们的观点和我们的一些观点一样有根据是不公正的。因为他们没有人比我们的一些人更具有外向性。
The comparison is unfair. 
这种比较是不公平的。
We must not put on the same level, and confound things, because they seem to agree in one point, while they are so different in another.

  654  The six ages, the six Fathers of the six ages, the six wonders at the beginning of the six ages, the six mornings at the beginning of the six ages.[238]   655  Adam _forma futuri_.[239] The six days to form the one, the six ages to form the other. 
 654 六个纪元，六个纪元的六位父亲，六个纪元之初的六大奇迹，六个纪元之初的六个早晨。[238]第655章 亚当_formafuturi_。[239]六日形成一，六岁形成另一。
The six days, which Moses represents for the formation of Adam, are only the picture of the six ages to form Jesus Christ and the Church. 
摩西所代表的六天形成亚当，只是形成耶稣基督和教会的六个时代的图画。
If Adam had not sinned, and Jesus Christ had not come, there had been only one covenant, only one age of men, and the creation would have been represented as accomplished at one single time. 
如果亚当没有犯罪，耶稣基督也没有来，那么就只有一个圣约，只有一个人类时代，而创造将会被描述为在一次完成。
  656  _Types._--The Jewish and Egyptian peoples were plainly foretold by the two individuals whom Moses met; the Egyptian beating the Jew, Moses avenging him and killing the Egyptian, and the Jew being ungrateful. 
 656_预表_--摩西所遇见的两个人清楚地预言了犹太民族和埃及民族。埃及人殴打犹太人，摩西为他报仇并杀死了埃及人，而犹太人却忘恩负义。
  657  The symbols of the Gospel for the state of the sick soul are sick bodies; but because one body cannot be sick enough to express it well, several have been needed. 
 657 福音对于患病灵魂状态的象征是患病的身体；但由于一个人的病情不足以充分表达它，所以需要多个人。
Thus there are the deaf, the dumb, the blind, the paralytic, the dead Lazarus, the possessed. 
因此，有聋子、哑巴、瞎子、瘫痪者、死去的拉撒路、被附身的人。
All this crowd is in the sick soul. 
这群人都是病态的灵魂。
  658  _Types._--To show that the Old Testament is only figurative, and that the prophets understood by temporal blessings other blessings, this is the proof:  First, that this would be unworthy of God. 
658_预表_--为了表明旧约只是象征性的，先知们将暂时的祝福理解为其他祝福，这就是证据：首先，这不配得到上帝。
 Secondly, that their discourses express very clearly the promise of temporal blessings, and that they say nevertheless that their discourses are obscure, and that their meaning will not be understood. 
其次，他们的话语非常清楚地表达了对现世祝福的应许，但他们却说他们的话语晦涩难懂，其含义不会被理解。
Whence it appears that this secret meaning was not that which they openly expressed, and that consequently they meant to speak of other sacrifices, of another deliverer, etc. 
由此看来，这个秘密的含义并不是他们公开表达的，因此他们打算谈论其他的牺牲，另一个拯救者等等。
They say that they will be understood only in the fullness of time (Jer. 
他们说，只有在时候满足的时候，他们才会被理解（耶利米书 11:11）。
xxx, _ult._). 
 xxx，_ult._）。
" The third proof is that their discourses are contradictory, and neutralise each other; so that if we think that they did not mean by the words ""law"" and ""sacrifice"" anything else than that of Moses, there is a plain and gross contradiction. "
第三个证据是他们的话语是矛盾的，并且是相互抵消的；因此，如果我们认为他们所说的“律法”和“献祭”这两个词除了摩西的意思之外，并无其他含义，那就存在明显而严重的矛盾。
Therefore they meant something else, sometimes contradicting themselves in the same chapter. 
因此，它们的意思是不同的，有时在同一章中是自相矛盾的。
Now, to understand the meaning of an author ... 
现在，要理解作者的含义......
  659  Lust has become natural to us, and has made our second nature. 
 659 欲望对我们来说已成为自然，并已成为我们的第二天性。
Thus there are two natures in us--the one good, the other bad. 
因此，我们有两种本性——一种是善的，另一种是恶的。
Where is God? Where you are not, and the kingdom of God is within you. 
神在哪里？你不在的地方，神的国就在你里面。
The Rabbis. 
拉比们。
  660  Penitence, alone of all these mysteries, has been manifestly declared to the Jews, and by Saint John, the Forerunner; and then the other mysteries; to indicate that in each man, as in the entire world, this order must be observed. 
 660 在所有这些奥秘中，只有忏悔是先行者圣约翰向犹太人明确宣布的；然后是其他的谜团；表明每个人都必须遵守这一秩序，就像整个世界一样。
  661  The carnal Jews understood neither the greatness nor the humiliation of the Messiah foretold in their prophecies. 
 661 属肉体的犹太人既不明白他们预言中所预言的弥赛亚的伟大，也不明白他的屈辱。
They misunderstood Him in His foretold greatness, as when He said that the Messiah should be lord of David, though his son, and that He was before Abraham, who had seen Him. 
他们误解了他所预言的伟大，就像他说弥赛亚应该是大卫的主，尽管他是大卫的儿子，而且他是在亚伯拉罕之前，而亚伯拉罕已经看见了他。
They did not believe Him so great as to be eternal, and they likewise misunderstood Him in His humiliation and in His death. 
他们不相信他伟大到永恒，他们同样也误解了他的屈辱和死亡。
"The Messiah, said they, ""abideth for ever, and this man says that he shall die.""[240] Therefore they believed Him neither mortal nor eternal; they only sought in Him for a carnal greatness. "
他们说，弥赛亚“永远存在，而这个人说他会死。”[240]因此，他们不相信他是凡人的，也不相信他是永恒的。他们只在他身上寻求肉体的伟大。
  662  _Typical._--Nothing is so like charity as covetousness, and nothing is so opposed to it. 
第662章
Thus the Jews, full of possessions which flattered their covetousness, were very like Christians, and very contrary. 
因此，犹太人充满了满足他们的贪婪的财产，他们非常像基督徒，但又非常相反。
And by this means they had the two qualities which it was necessary they should have, to be very like the Messiah to typify Him, and very contrary not to be suspected witnesses. 
通过这种方式，他们具备了他们必须具备的两种品质，一是非常像弥赛亚来预表他，二是非常相反，不被怀疑是见证人。
  663  _Typical._--God made use of the lust of the Jews to make them minister to Jesus Christ, [who brought the remedy for their lust]. 
 663_典型._--上帝利用犹太人的情欲，使他们事奉耶稣基督，[他为他们的情欲带来了补救办法]。
  664  Charity is not a figurative precept. 
 664 慈善不是一个比喻的戒律。
It is dreadful to say that Jesus Christ, who came to take away types in order to establish the truth, came only to establish the type of charity, in order to take away the existing reality which was there before. 
可怕的是，耶稣基督来是为了消除预表以建立真理，他来只是为了建立仁爱的预表，以便消除以前存在的现实。
" ""If the light be darkness, how great is that darkness!""[241]   665  Fascination. "
 “如果光明是黑暗，那黑暗是多么巨大！”[241] 665 魅力。
_Somnum suum.[242] Figura hujus mundi._[243]  The Eucharist. 
 _Somnum suum。[242] Figura hujus mundi._[243] 圣体圣事。
_Comedes panem_ tuum.[244] _Panem_ nostrum. 
 _Comedes panem_ tuum。[244] _施惠国_灵丹妙药。
 _Inimici Dei terram lingent._[245] Sinners lick the dust, that is to say, love earthly pleasures. 
 _Inimici Dei terram lingent._[245] 罪人舔尘，也就是说，热爱尘世的享乐。
 The Old Testament contained the types of future joy, and the New contains the means of arriving at it. 
旧约包含了未来喜乐的类型，而新约则包含了达到它的方法。
The types were of joy; the means of penitence; and nevertheless the Paschal Lamb was eaten with bitter herbs, _cum amaritudinibus_.[246]  _Singularis sum ego donec transeam._[247]--Jesus Christ before His death was almost the only martyr. 
这些类型都是欢乐的；忏悔的手段；尽管如此，逾越节羔羊还是和苦草一起吃的，_cum amaritudinibus_。 [246] _Singularis sum ego donec transeam._[247]--耶稣基督在死前几乎是唯一的殉道者。
  666  _Typical._--The expressions, sword, shield. 
第666章_典型._--表情，剑，盾。
_Potentissime._   667  We are estranged, only by departing from charity. 
_Potentissime._ 667 只有远离慈善事业，我们才会疏远。
Our prayers and our virtues are abominable before God, if they are not the prayers and the virtues of Jesus Christ. 
如果我们的祷告和美德不是耶稣基督的祷告和美德，那么它们在神面前就是可憎的。
And our sins will never be the object of [_mercy_], but of the justice of God, if they are not [_those of_] Jesus Christ. 
我们的罪孽永远不会成为[_怜悯_]的对象，而是上帝正义的对象，如果它们不是[_]耶稣基督的罪孽。
He has adopted our sins, and has [_admitted_] us into union [_with Him_], for virtues are [_His own, and_] sins are foreign to Him; while virtues _[are]_ foreign to us, and our sins are our own. 
他已经承担了我们的罪孽，并[_承认_]我们与[_与他_]联合，因为美德是[_他自己的_]，罪孽对他来说是陌生的；而美德对我们来说是陌生的，而我们的罪恶则是我们自己的。
 Let us change the rule which we have hitherto chosen for judging what is good. 
让我们改变迄今为止所选择的判断善恶的规则。
We had our own will as our rule. 
我们以自己的意志为规则。
Let us now take the will of [_God_]; all that He wills is good and right to us, all that He does not will is [_bad_]. 
现在让我们接受[_God_]的意志；他所愿意的一切对我们来说都是好的和正确的，他所不愿意的都是[_坏_]。
 All that God does not permit is forbidden. 
凡是神所不允许的，都是被禁止的。
Sins are forbidden by the general declaration that God has made, that He did not allow them. 
上帝已作出一般性声明，禁止罪恶，他不允许罪恶发生。
Other things which He has left without general prohibition, and which for that reason are said to be permitted, are nevertheless not always permitted. 
他没有普遍禁止的其他事情，因此据说是允许的，但并不总是允许的。
For when God removed some one of them from us, and when, by the event, which is a manifestation of the will of God, it appears that God does not will that we should have a thing, that is then forbidden to us as sin; since the will of God is that we should not have one more than another. 
因为当上帝从我们身上除去其中的某个人时，当通过这一事件（这是上帝旨意的体现）时，上帝似乎不希望我们拥有一件被视为罪孽的东西;因为神的旨意是我们不应该多拥有一个。
There is this sole difference between these two things, that it is certain that God will never allow sin, while it is not certain that He will never allow the other. 
这两件事之间唯一的区别是，可以肯定的是，神永远不会允许罪恶，但不确定神是否永远不会允许罪恶。
But so long as God does not permit it, we ought to regard it as sin; so long as the absence of God's will, which alone is all goodness and all justice, renders it unjust and wrong. 
但只要神不许可，我们就应该认为这是罪；只要缺乏上帝的意志（上帝的意志就是一切善良和正义），它就会变得不公正和错误。
  668  To change the type, because of our weakness. 
 668 改变类型，因为我们的弱点。
  669  _Types._--The Jews had grown old in these earthly thoughts, that God loved their father Abraham, his flesh and what sprung from it; that on account of this He had multiplied them, and distinguished them from all other nations, without allowing them to intermingle; that when they were languishing in Egypt, He brought them out with all these great signs in their favour; that He fed them with manna in the desert, and led them into a very rich land; that He gave them kings and a well-built temple, in order to offer up beasts before Him, by the shedding of whose blood they should be purified; and that at last He was to send them the Messiah to make them masters of all the world, and foretold the time of His coming. 
669_预表_--犹太人在这些属世的思想中已经变老了，即上帝爱他们的父亲亚伯拉罕、他的肉体以及由此产生的一切；因此，他使他们繁衍生息，并将他们与所有其他民族区别开来，不允许他们混合在一起。当他们在埃及受苦的时候，他用这一切有利于他们的伟大神迹把他们领出来。他在沙漠中用吗哪喂养他们，并带领他们进入一片非常肥沃的土地；他赐予他们国王和一座坚固的圣殿，以便将牲畜献在他面前，他们所流的血可以使他们洁净；最后，他将派遣弥赛亚给他们，使他们成为全世界的主人，并预言了他到来的时间。
 The world having grown old in these carnal errors, Jesus Christ came at the time foretold, but not with the expected glory; and thus men did not think it was He. 
世界在这些肉体的错误中变得衰老，耶稣基督在预言的时间到来，但没有带来预期的荣耀；因此人们不认为那是他。
After His death, Saint Paul[248] came to teach men that all these things had happened in allegory; that the kingdom of God did not consist in the flesh, but in the spirit; that the enemies of men were not the Babylonians, but the passions; that God delighted not in temples made with hands, but in a pure and contrite heart; that the circumcision of the body was unprofitable, but that of the heart was needed; that Moses had not given them the bread from heaven, etc.[249]  But God, not having desired to reveal these things to this people who were unworthy of them, and having nevertheless desired to foretell them, in order that they might be believed, foretold the time clearly, and expressed the things sometimes clearly, but very often in figures, in order that those who loved symbols might consider them, and those who loved what was symbolised might see it therein. 
圣保罗[248]死后，教导人们所有这些事情都是在寓言中发生的。神的国不在于肉体，而在于灵；人类的敌人不是巴比伦人，而是激情；神不喜悦人手建造的殿宇，只喜悦纯洁痛悔的心；身体的割礼是无益的，但心灵的割礼才是必要的；摩西没有给他们天上的粮等等。[249]但是上帝并不想向这些不配的人揭示这些事情，但仍然希望预言它们，以便人们相信它们，所以清楚地预言了时间，并且有时清楚地表达了这些事情，但很多时候以便那些喜爱象征的人可以考虑它们，让那些喜爱象征的东西的人可以在其中看到它。
 All that tends not to charity is figurative. 
所有不倾向于慈善的事情都是象征性的。
 The sole aim of the Scripture is charity. 
圣经的唯一目的是慈善。
 All which tends not to the sole end is the type of it. 
所有不趋向于唯一目的的都是它的类型。
For since there is only one end, all which does not lead to it in express terms is figurative. 
因为既然只有一个目的，所有没有以明确的方式通向这一目的的事物都是象征性的。
 God thus varies that sole precept of charity to satisfy our curiosity, which seeks for variety, by that variety which still leads us to the one thing needful. 
因此，上帝改变了仁爱的唯一戒律，以满足我们寻求多样性的好奇心，而这种多样性仍然引导我们找到所需要的一件事。
For one thing alone is needful,[250] and we love variety; and God satisfies both by these varieties, which lead to the one thing needful. 
一方面，只有一件事是必要的，[250]而且我们喜欢多样性；上帝通过这些多样性满足了两者，从而导致了所需要的一件事。
 The Jews have so much loved the shadows, and have so strictly expected them, that they have misunderstood the reality, when it came in the time and manner foretold. 
犹太人如此热爱阴影，并如此严格地期望它们，以至于当现实以预言的时间和方式到来时，他们误解了现实。
 The Rabbis take the breasts of the Spouse[251] for types, and all that does not express the only end they have, namely, temporal good. 
拉比们将配偶的乳房[251]视为预表，而所有这些都没有表达他们唯一的目的，即世俗的善。
 And Christians take even the Eucharist as a type of the glory at which they aim. 
基督徒甚至将圣体圣事视为他们所追求的荣耀的预表。
  670  The Jews, who have been called to subdue nations and kings, have been the slaves of sin; and the Christians, whose calling has been to be servants and subjects, are free children.[252]   671  _A formal point._--When Saint Peter and the Apostles deliberated about abolishing circumcision, where it was a question of acting against the law of God, they did not heed the prophets, but simply the reception of the Holy Spirit in the persons uncircumcised.[253]  They thought it more certain that God approved of those whom He filled with His Spirit, than it was that the law must be obeyed. 
670 被呼召去征服国家和君王的犹太人，却一直是罪的奴隶；基督徒的使命是成为仆人和臣民，他们是自由的孩子。 [252]第 671 章未受割礼。[253]他们认为神认可那些被他的灵充满的人比必须遵守法律更确定。
They knew that the end of the law was only the Holy Spirit; and that thus, as men certainly had this without circumcision, it was not necessary. 
他们知道律法的目的只是圣灵；因此，由于男人在没有受割礼的情况下确实有这种情况，所以这是没有必要的。
  672  _Fac secundum exemplar quod tibi ostensum est in monte._[254]--The Jewish religion then has been formed on its likeness to the truth of the Messiah; and the truth of the Messiah has been recognised by the Jewish religion, which was the type of it. 
 672 _Fac secundum exemplar quod tibi ostensum est in monte._[254]--犹太宗教于是在其与弥赛亚真理的相似性上形成；弥赛亚的真理已被犹太教所承认，犹太教就是它的类型。
 Among the Jews the truth was only typified; in heaven it is revealed. 
在犹太人中，真理只是象征性的；在犹太人中，真理只是象征性的。在天上它被揭示。
 In the Church it is hidden, and recognised by its resemblance to the type. 
在教会中，它是隐藏的，并通过其与预表的相似性而被识别。
 The type has been made according to the truth, and the truth has been recognised according to the type. 
预表是按照真理而造的，真理也是按照预表而被认识的。
 Saint Paul[255] says himself that people will forbid to marry, and he himself speaks of it to the Corinthians in a way which is a snare. 
圣保罗[255]自己说人们将禁止结婚，他本人以一种陷阱的方式向哥林多人谈论这件事。
For if a prophet had said the one, and Saint Paul had then said the other, he would have been accused. 
因为如果一位先知说了一个，而圣保罗则说了另一个，他就会受到指控。
"  673  _Typical._--""Do all things according to the pattern which has been shown thee on the mount."" On which Saint Paul says that the Jews have shadowed forth heavenly things.[256]   674  ... "
 673_典型。_--“按照在山上向你展示的模式做所有事情。”圣保罗对此说犹太人已经投射出天上的事物。 [256]第674章
And yet this Covenant, made to blind some and enlighten others, indicated in those very persons, whom it blinded, the truth which should be recognised by others. 
然而，这个盟约是为了蒙蔽一些人而启发另一些人，却在那些被它蒙蔽的人身上表明了应该被其他人承认的真理。
For the visible blessings which they received from God were so great and so divine, that He indeed appeared able to give them those that are invisible, and a Messiah. 
因为他们从上帝那里得到的看得见的祝福是如此伟大和神圣，以至于他确实能够赐给他们那些看不见的祝福，以及弥赛亚。
 For nature is an image of Grace, and visible miracles are images of the invisible. 
因为自然是恩典的形象，可见的奇迹是不可见的形象。
_Ut sciatis ... 
 _坐骨神经痛...
tibi dico: Surge._  Isaiah says that Redemption will be as the passage of the Red Sea. 
 tibi dico：激增。_以赛亚说救赎将像红海的通道一样。
 God has then shown by the deliverance from Egypt, and from the sea, by the defeat of kings, by the manna, by the whole genealogy of Abraham, that He was able to save, to send down bread from heaven, etc.; so that the people hostile to Him are the type and the representation of the very Messiah whom they know not, etc. 
然后，上帝通过从埃及、从海上、通过击败国王、通过吗哪、通过亚伯拉罕的整个家谱，表明他能够拯救，从天上降下粮食等等；因此那些敌视他的人就是他们所不认识的弥赛亚的预表和代表，等等。
" He has then taught us at last that all these things were only types, and what is ""true freedom,"" a ""true Israelite,"" ""true circumcision,"" ""true bread from heaven,"" etc. "
最后他教导我们，所有这些东西都只是预表，什么是“真正的自由”、“真正的以色列人”、“真正的割礼”、“真正从天上来的粮”等等。
 In these promises each one finds what he has most at heart, temporal benefits or spiritual, God or the creatures; but with this difference, that those who therein seek the creatures find them, but with many contradictions, with a prohibition against loving them, with the command to worship God only, and to love Him only, which is the same thing, and, finally, that the Messiah came not for them; whereas those who therein seek God find Him, without any contradiction, with the command to love Him only, and that the Messiah came in the time foretold, to give them the blessings which they ask. 
在这些应许中，每个人都能找到自己最珍视的东西：属世的利益或属灵的利益、上帝或受造物；但有一个区别，那些在其中寻找生物的人找到了它们，但有许多矛盾，禁止爱它们，命令只崇拜上帝，只爱他，这是同一件事，最后，弥赛亚不是为他们而来；而那些在其中寻求上帝的人毫无矛盾地发现他有只爱他的命令，并且弥赛亚在预言的时间到来，给他们所要求的祝福。
 Thus the Jews had miracles and prophecies, which they say fulfilled and the teaching of their law was to worship and love God only; it was also perpetual. 
因此，犹太人有奇迹和预言，他们说这些奇迹和预言都实现了，他们的律法的教导是只敬拜和爱上帝。它也是永恒的。
Thus it had all the marks of the true religion; and so it was. 
因此它具有真正宗教的所有标志。确实如此。
But the Jewish teaching must be distinguished from the teaching of the Jewish law. 
但犹太教义必须与犹太律法的教义区分开来。
Now the Jewish teaching was not true, although it had miracles and prophecy and perpetuity, because it had not this other point of worshipping and loving God only. 
犹太教虽然有神迹、预言和永恒，但它并不真实，因为它没有敬拜和爱上帝的另一点。
  675  The veil, which is upon these books for the Jews, is there also for evil Christians, and for all who do not hate themselves. 
 675 这些书上的幔子是为犹太人准备的，也为邪恶的基督徒和所有不恨自己的人准备。
 But how well disposed men are to understand them and to know Jesus Christ, when they truly hate themselves!   676  A type conveys absence and presence, pleasure and pain. 
但当人们真正恨自己时，他们是多么愿意理解他们并认识耶稣基督啊！ 676 A 类型传达不在场与在场、快乐与痛苦。
 A cipher has a double meaning, one clear, and one in which it is said that the meaning is hidden. 
密码具有双重含义，一种是明确的，另一种是隐藏的。
  677  _Types._--A portrait conveys absence and presence, pleasure and pain. 
 677 _Types._--肖像传达缺席与在场、快乐与痛苦。
The reality excludes absence and pain. 
现实排除了缺席和痛苦。
 To know if the law and the sacrifices are a reality or a type, we must see if the prophets, in speaking of these things, confined their view and their thought to them, so that they saw only the old covenant; or if they saw therein something else of which they were the representation, for in a portrait we see the thing figured. 
要知道律法和献祭是实际还是预表，我们必须看看先知们在谈论这些事时，是否将他们的观点和思想局限于它们，以致他们只看到了旧约；或者说，他们是否把他们的观点和思想局限于它们，以致他们只看到了旧约？或者如果他们在其中看到了他们代表的其他东西，因为在肖像中我们看到了所描绘的东西。
For this we need only examine what they say of them. 
为此，我们只需要检查他们对他们的评价。
 When they say that it will be eternal, do they mean to speak of that covenant which they say will be changed; and so of the sacrifices, etc.?  A cipher has two meanings. 
当他们说这将是永恒的时，他们的意思是指他们所说的那个圣约将会被改变吗？还有牺牲等等？密码有两种含义。
When we find out an important letter in which we discover a clear meaning, and in which it is nevertheless said that the meaning is veiled and obscure, that it is hidden, so that we might read the letter without seeing it, and interpret it without understanding it, what must we think but that here is a cipher with a double meaning, and the more so if we find obvious contradictions in the literal meaning? The prophets have clearly said that Israel would be always loved by God, and that the law would be eternal; and they have said that their meaning would not be understood, and that it was veiled. 
当我们发现一封重要的信件时，我们在其中发现了明确的含义，但据说其中的含义是隐藏的和模糊的，它是隐藏的，这样我们就可以在没有看到它的情况下阅读这封信，并在没有看到它的情况下解释它。理解了它，我们必须想到什么，除了这是一个具有双重含义的密码，如果我们发现字面意义明显矛盾，那就更是如此了？先知们清楚地说过，以色列将永远受到上帝的爱，律法将是永恒的；他们说他们的意思不会被理解，并且它被掩盖了。
 How greatly then ought we to value those who interpret the cipher, and teach us to understand the hidden meaning, especially if the principles which they educe are perfectly clear and natural! This is what Jesus Christ did, and the Apostles. 
那么，我们应该多么重视那些解释密码并教导我们理解隐藏含义的人，特别是如果他们所推导出的原理是完全清晰和自然的！这就是耶稣基督和使徒所做的。
They broke the seal; He rent the veil, and revealed the spirit. 
他们打破了封印；他撕开了面纱，显露出了精神。
They have taught us through this that the enemies of man are his passions; that the Redeemer would be spiritual, and His reign spiritual; that there would be two advents, one in lowliness to humble the proud, the other in glory to exalt the humble; that Jesus Christ would be both God and man. 
他们由此教导我们，人类的敌人是他的激情；人类的敌人是他的激情。救赎主是属灵的，他的统治也是属灵的；将会有两次降临，一次在卑微中使骄傲的人降卑，另一次在荣耀中使谦卑的人高举。耶稣基督既是神又是人。
  678  _Types._--Jesus Christ opened their mind to understand the Scriptures. 
 678_预表_--耶稣基督开启他们的心智，使他们明白圣经。
 Two great revelations are these. 
这是两个伟大的启示。
(1) All things happened to them in types: _vere Israëlitæ, vere liberi_, true bread from Heaven. 
 (1) 所有的事情都以类型的形式发生在他们身上：_vere Israëlitæ，vere liberi_，来自天堂的真正面包。
(2) A God humbled to the Cross. 
 (2) 一位谦卑在十字架上的神。
"It was necessary that Christ should suffer in order to enter into glory, ""that He should destroy death through death.""[257] Two advents. "
基督必须受苦才能进入荣耀，“他要以死除灭死。”[257] 两次降临。
  679  _Types._--When once this secret is disclosed, it is impossible not to see it. 
 679 _Types._--一旦这个秘密被公开，就不可能不看到它。
Let us read the Old Testament in this light, and let us see if the sacrifices were real; if the fatherhood of Abraham was the true cause of the friendship of God; and if the promised land was the true place of rest. 
让我们从这个角度来阅读旧约，看看这些献祭是否真实；如果亚伯拉罕的父亲身份是上帝友谊的真正原因；如果应许之地是真正的安息之地。
No. 
不。
They are therefore types. 
因此它们是类型。
Let us in the same way examine all those ordained ceremonies, all those commandments which are not of charity, and we shall see that they are types. 
让我们以同样的方式检查所有那些被任命的仪式，所有那些非慈善的戒律，我们就会发现它们都是预表。
 All these sacrifices and ceremonies were then either types or nonsense. 
所有这些祭祀和仪式在当时要么是预表，要么是无稽之谈。
Now these are things too clear, and too lofty, to be thought nonsense. 
现在这些事情太清楚了，太崇高了，不能被认为是胡说八道。
 To know if the prophets confined their view in the Old Testament, or saw therein other things. 
了解先知们是否将他们的观点局限于旧约，或者在其中看到了其他事情。

Here is the cipher which Saint Paul gives us. 
这是圣保罗给我们的密码。
Christ must suffer. 
基督必须受苦。
An humiliated God. 
一个被羞辱的神。
Circumcision of the heart, true fasting, true sacrifice, a true temple. 
心灵的割礼、真正的禁食、真正的牺牲、真正的圣殿。
The prophets have shown that all these must be spiritual. 
先知们已经表明，所有这些都必须是属灵的。
 Not the meat which perishes, but that which does not perish. 
不是会腐烂的肉，而是不会腐烂的肉。
" ""Ye shall be free indeed.""[260] Then the other freedom was only a type of freedom. "
“你们确实将是自由的。”[260] 那么其他自由只是一种自由。
" ""I am the true bread from Heaven.""[261]   683  _Contradiction._--We can only describe a good character by reconciling all contrary qualities, and it is not enough to keep up a series of harmonious qualities, without reconciling contradictory ones. "
 “我是真正的天上的面包。”[261] 683 _矛盾._--我们只能通过调和所有相反的品质来描述一个良好的品格，并且在不调和矛盾的品质的情况下保持一系列和谐的品质是不够的。
To understand the meaning of an author, we must make all the contrary passages agree. 
要理解作者的意思，我们必须使所有相反的段落都一致。
 Thus, to understand Scripture, we must have a meaning in which all the contrary passages are reconciled. 
因此，要理解圣经，我们必须有一个意义，其中所有相反的段落都得到调和。
It is not enough to have one which suits many concurring passages; but it is necessary to have one which reconciles even contradictory passages. 
仅仅拥有一个适合许多并发段落的内容是不够的；但有必要有一个能够调和甚至矛盾的段落。
 Every author has a meaning in which all the contradictory passages agree, or he has no meaning at all. 
每个作者都有一个所有矛盾段落都一致的意义，否则他就根本没有意义。
We cannot affirm the latter of Scripture and the prophets; they undoubtedly are full of good sense. 
我们不能肯定圣经和先知的后者。他们无疑是充满理智的。
We must then seek for a meaning which reconciles all discrepancies. 
然后我们必须寻求一种能够调和所有差异的意义。
 The true meaning then is not that of the Jews; but in Jesus Christ all the contradictions are reconciled. 
那么，真正的意义就不是犹太人的意义；而是犹太人的意义。但在耶稣基督里，所有的矛盾都得到了调和。
 The Jews could not reconcile the cessation of the royalty and principality, foretold by Hosea, with the prophecy of Jacob. 
犹太人无法调和何西阿所预言的王权和公国的终止与雅各的预言。
 If we take the law, the sacrifices, and the kingdom as realities, we cannot reconcile all the passages. 
如果我们把律法、祭物和国度当作现实，我们就无法调和所有的经文。
They must then necessarily be only types. 
那么它们必然是唯一类型。
We cannot even reconcile the passages of the same author, nor of the same book, nor sometimes of the same chapter, which indicates copiously what was the meaning of the author. 
我们甚至无法调和同一作者、同一本书、有时甚至同一章节的段落，这些段落充分表明了作者的含义。
As when Ezekiel, chap, xx, says that man will not live by the commandments of God and will live by them. 
正如以西结书第 xx 章所说，人不会按照上帝的诫命生活，而是会按照这些诫命生活。
  684  _Types._--If the law and the sacrifices are the truth, it must please God, and must not displease Him. 
 684_预表_--如果律法和献祭是真理，它一定会讨神喜悦，并且绝不会令他不悦。
If they are types, they must be both pleasing and displeasing. 
如果他们是类型，他们一定既令人愉快又令人不愉快。
 Now in all the Scripture they are both pleasing and displeasing. 
在整本圣经中，它们既令人愉快，又令人不愉快。
It is said that the law shall be changed; that the sacrifice shall be changed; that they shall be without law, without a prince, and without a sacrifice; that a new covenant shall be made; that the law shall be renewed; that the precepts which they have received are not good; that their sacrifices are abominable; that God has demanded none of them. 
据说法律要修改；祭品要改变；他们将没有法律，没有君主，也没有祭祀；订立新约；法律应更新；所受戒不善；他们的牺牲是可憎的；上帝没有要求他们中的任何一个。
 It is said, on the contrary, that the law shall abide for ever; that this covenant shall be for ever; that sacrifice shall be eternal; that the sceptre shall never depart from among them, because it shall not depart from them till the eternal King comes. 
相反，据说法律将永远有效。此约永远有效；那种牺牲将是永恒的；权杖永远不会离开他们，因为直到永恒的君王来临之前，它都不会离开他们。
 Do all these passages indicate what is real? No. 
所有这些段落都表明什么是真实的吗？不。
Do they then indicate what is typical? No, but what is either real or typical. 
那么它们是否表明什么是典型的？不，但什么是真实的或典型的。
But the first passages, excluding as they do reality, indicate that all this is only typical. 
但前几段，排除了现实，表明这一切只是典型的。
 All these passages together cannot be applied to reality; all can be said to be typical; therefore they are not spoken of reality, but of the type. 
所有这些段落加在一起并不能应用于现实；都可以说是典型的；因此，它们不是指现实，而是指类型。
 _Agnus occisus est ab origine mundi._[262] A sacrificing judge. 
_Agnus occisus est ab origine mundi._[262] 一位牺牲的法官。
  685  _Contradictions._--The sceptre till the Messiah--without king or prince. 
 685_矛盾._--直到弥赛亚的权杖--没有国王或王子。

永恒的法则——改变了。
 The eternal covenant--a new covenant. 
永恒之约——新约。
 Good laws--bad precepts. 
好的法律——坏的戒律。
Ezekiel. 
以西结.
  686  _Types._--When the word of God, which is really true, is false literally, it is true spiritually. 
 686_类型._--当神的话确实真实，但字面上是假的时，它在属灵上却是真实的。
_Sede a dextris meis:_[263] this is false literally, therefore it is true spiritually. 
 _Sede a dextris meis:_[263] 这在字面上是错误的，因此在精神上是正确的。
 In these expressions, God is spoken of after the manner of men; and this means nothing else but that the intention which men have in giving a seat at their right hand, God will have also. 
在这些表达中，上帝是按照人的方式来谈论的。这无非是说，人愿意让自己坐在自己的右边，上帝也会有这样的意愿。
It is then an indication of the intention of God, not of His manner of carrying it out. 
那么它表明了上帝的意图，而不是他实现它的方式。
" Thus when it is said, ""God has received the odour of your incense, and will in recompense give you a rich land,"" that is equivalent to saying that the same intention which a man would have, who, pleased with your perfumes, should in recompense give you a rich land, God will have towards you, because you have had the same intention as a man has towards him to whom he presents perfumes. "
因此，当说：“上帝已接受了你的香气，并将赐予你肥沃的土地作为回报”，这相当于说，一个人如果喜欢你的香水，他也应该有同样的意图。作为回报，上帝会赐给你一块肥沃的土地，因为你对他所献上的香料的心意与人对他的心意相同。
"So _iratus est_, a ""jealous God,""[264] etc. "
所以_iratus est_，一个“嫉妒的上帝”，[264]等等。
For, the things of God being inexpressible, they cannot be spoken of otherwise, and the Church makes use of them even to-day: _Quia confortavil seras_,[265] etc. 
因为，上帝的事物是无法表达的，它们不能以其他方式谈论，甚至在今天教会仍在使用它们：_Quia confortavil seras_，[265]等。
 It is not allowable to attribute to Scripture the meaning which is not revealed to us that it has. 
不允许将圣经未向我们启示的含义归于圣经。
Thus, to say that the closed _mem_[266] of Isaiah signifies six hundred, has not been revealed. 
因此，说以赛亚的封闭_mem_[266]表示六百，还没有被揭示。
It might be said that the final _tsade_ and _he deficientes_ may signify mysteries. 
可以说，最后的“tsade”和“the deficientes”可能意味着神秘。
But it is not allowable to say so, and still less to say this is the way of the philosopher's stone. 
但这样说是不行的，更不能说这是点金石之道。
But we say that the literal meaning is not the true meaning, because the prophets have themselves said so. 
但我们说字面意思并不是真正的意思，因为先知们自己也这么说。
  687  I do not say that the _mem_ is mystical. 
第687章 我并不是说_mem_是神秘的。
  688  Moses (Deut. 
第688章 摩西（申命记）
xxx) promises that God will circumcise their heart to render them capable of loving Him. 
 xxx）应许神会给他们的心行割礼，使他们能够爱他。
"  689  One saying of David, or of Moses, as for instance that ""God will circumcise the heart,"" enables us to judge of their spirit. "
 689 大卫或摩西的一句名言，例如“上帝必给心灵行割礼”，使我们能够判断他们的精神。
If all their other expressions were ambiguous, and left us in doubt whether they were philosophers or Christians, one saying of this kind would in fact determine all the rest, as one sentence of Epictetus decides the meaning of all the rest to be the opposite. 
如果他们所有其他的表达方式都是模棱两可的，让我们怀疑他们是哲学家还是基督徒，那么这种说法实际上就决定了其余的所有说法，就像爱比克泰德的一句话决定了其余所有说法的相反含义一样。
So far ambiguity exists, but not afterwards. 
到目前为止，还存在歧义，但之后就不存在了。
  690  If one of two persons, who are telling silly stories, uses language with a double meaning, understood in his own circle, while the other uses it with only one meaning, any one not in the secret, who hears them both talk in this manner, will pass upon them the same judgment. 
第690章 如果两个人在讲愚蠢的故事时，其中一个人使用具有双重含义的语言，在他自己的圈子里可以理解，而另一个人则只使用一种含义，任何不在秘密中的人，听到他们俩在这个圈子里说话的人方式，将给予他们同样的判断。
But if afterwards, in the rest of their conversation one says angelic things, and the other always dull commonplaces, he will judge that the one spoke in mysteries, and not the other; the one having sufficiently shown that he is incapable of such foolishness, and capable of being mysterious; and the other that he is incapable of mystery, and capable of foolishness. 
但如果后来，在他们谈话的其余部分中，一个人说的是天使般的事情，而另一个人总是说一些乏味的陈词滥调，他就会断定这个人说的是神秘的事情，而不是另一个人；这个人已经充分表明他不会做出这种愚蠢的事，并且能够保持神秘；另一个是他无法神秘，而且会变得愚蠢。
 The Old Testament is a cipher. 
旧约是一个密码。
  691  There are some that see clearly that man has no other enemy than lust, which turns him from God, and not God; and that he has no other good than God, and not a rich land. 
 691 有些人清楚地看到，人除了欲望之外没有其他敌人，欲望使人远离神，而不是神；他除了上帝之外没有别的善，也没有肥沃的土地。
Let those who believe that the good of man is in the flesh, and evil in what turns him away from sensual pleasures, [_satiate_] themselves with them, and [_die_] in them. 
让那些相信人的善在于肉体，恶在于使人远离感官享乐的人，[满足]自己，并在其中[死亡]。
But let those who seek God with all their heart, who are only troubled at not seeing Him, who desire only to possess Him, and have as enemies only those who turn them away from Him, who are grieved at seeing themselves surrounded and overwhelmed with such enemies, take comfort. 
但让那些全心全意寻求上帝的人，那些只为看不到他而烦恼的人，那些只想拥有他的人，那些只把那些使他们远离他的人作为敌人的人，那些因看到自己被包围而感到悲伤的人这样的敌人，放心吧。
I proclaim to them happy news. 
我向他们宣布好消息。
There exists a Redeemer for them. 
他们有一位救赎主。
I shall show Him to them. 
我将向他们展示他。
I shall show that there is a God for them. 
我将证明他们有一位上帝。
I shall not show Him to others. 
我不会向别人展示他。
I shall make them see that a Messiah has been promised, who should deliver them from their enemies, and that One has come to free them from their iniquities, but not from their enemies. 
我将使他们看到，已经应许了一位弥赛亚，他应该把他们从敌人手中拯救出来，并且那一位已经来将他们从他们的罪孽中解放出来，但不是从他们的敌人手中解放出来。
 When David foretold that the Messiah would deliver His people from their enemies, one can believe that in the flesh these would be the Egyptians; and then I cannot show that the prophecy was fulfilled. 
当大卫预言弥赛亚将把他的子民从敌人手中拯救出来时，人们可以相信，在肉身中，这些人将是埃及人；但事实上，他们是埃及人。然后我就无法证明预言已经应验了。
But one can well believe also that the enemies would be their sins; for indeed the Egyptians were not their enemies, but their sins were so. 
但我们也可以相信，敌人就是他们的罪孽。因为埃及人确实不是他们的敌人，但他们的罪孽却是他们的敌人。
This word, enemies, is therefore ambiguous. 
因此，敌人这个词是有歧义的。
But if he says elsewhere, as he does, that He will deliver His people from their sins, as indeed do Isaiah and others, the ambiguity is removed, and the double meaning of enemies is reduced to the simple meaning of iniquities. 
但如果他在别处说，正如他所做的那样，他将把他的子民从罪恶中拯救出来，就像以赛亚和其他人所做的那样，那么歧义就被消除了，敌人的双重含义就被简化为罪孽的简单含义。
For if he had sins in his mind, he could well denote them as enemies; but if he thought of enemies, he could not designate them as iniquities. 
因为如果他心中有罪，他很可能将它们视为敌人；但如果他想到敌人，他就无法将他们视为罪孽。
 Now Moses, David, and Isaiah used the same terms. 
摩西、大卫和以赛亚使用同样的术语。
Who will say then that they have not the same meaning, and that David's meaning, which is plainly iniquities when he spoke of enemies, was not the same as [_that of_] Moses when speaking of enemies?  Daniel (ix) prays for the deliverance of the people from the captivity of their enemies. 
那么谁会说它们具有不同的含义，并且大卫在谈到敌人时明显是罪孽的含义与摩西在谈到敌人时的含义不同？但以理（九）祈求将人民从敌人的囚禁中解救出来。
But he was thinking of sins, and, to show this, he says that Gabriel came to tell him that his prayer was heard, and that there were only seventy weeks to wait, after which the people would be freed from iniquity, sin would have an end, and the Redeemer, the Holy of Holies, would bring _eternal_ justice, not legal, but eternal. 
但他想到的是罪恶，为了表明这一点，他说加百列来告诉他，他的祈祷已被听到，只有七十个星期的等待时间，之后人民将摆脱罪恶，罪恶将被消灭。一个结束，救赎主，至圣所，将带来永恒的正义，不是合法的，而是永恒的。
    SECTION XI  THE PROPHECIES   692  When I see the blindness and the wretchedness of man, when I regard the whole silent universe, and man without light, left to himself, and, as it were, lost in this corner of the universe, without knowing who has put him there, what he has come to do, what will become of him at death, and incapable of all knowledge, I become terrified, like a man who should be carried in his sleep to a dreadful desert island, and should awake without knowing where he is, and without means of escape. 
第十一节 预言 692 当我看到人类的盲目和悲惨，当我看到整个寂静的宇宙，人类没有光，只剩下自己，就像迷失在宇宙的这个角落，不知道是谁把他放在那里，他来这里是为了做什么，他死后会怎么样，我无法知道所有的事情，我变得害怕，就像一个人在睡梦中被带到一个可怕的荒岛，醒来时却毫无知觉。知道他在哪里，却没有逃脱的办法。
And thereupon I wonder how people in a condition so wretched do not fall into despair. 
于是我想知道处于如此悲惨境地的人如何不陷入绝望。
I see other persons around me of a like nature. 
我看到周围有类似性质的人。
I ask them if they are better informed than I am. 
我问他们是否比我更了解情况。
They tell me that they are not. 
他们告诉我他们不是。
And thereupon these wretched and lost beings, having looked around them, and seen some pleasing objects, have given and attached themselves to them. 
于是，这些可怜而迷失的众生，环顾四周，看到了一些令人愉悦的事物，就将自己奉献并依附于它们。
For my own part, I have not been able to attach myself to them, and, considering how strongly it appears that there is something else than what I see, I have examined whether this God has not left some sign of Himself. 
就我个人而言，我无法将自己与它们联系在一起，而且，考虑到似乎有比我所看到的更强烈的东西，我检查了这位上帝是否没有留下任何他自己的迹象。
 I see many contradictory religions, and consequently all false save one. 
我看到许多相互矛盾的宗教，因此除了一种宗教外，所有宗教都是错误的。
Each wants to be believed on its own authority, and threatens unbelievers. 
每个人都希望凭借自己的权威而被相信，并威胁不信者。
I do not therefore believe them. 
因此我不相信他们。
Every one can say this; every one can call himself a prophet. 
每个人都可以这样说；每个人都可以称自己为先知。
But I see that Christian religion wherein prophecies are fulfilled; and that is what every one cannot do. 
但我看到基督教的预言得以实现；这是每个人都无法做到的。
  693  And what crowns all this is prediction, so that it should not be said that it is chance which has done it. 
 693 而这一切的最重要的是预测，因此不应该说这是偶然造成的。
 Whosoever, having only a week to live, will not find out that it is expedient to believe that all this is not a stroke of chance ... 
凡是只剩下一周生命的人，都不会发现相信这一切都不是偶然的事是有利的……
 Now, if the passions had no hold on us, a week and a hundred years would amount to the same thing. 
现在，如果激情没有控制我们，一周和一百年就等于同样的事情。
  694  _Prophecies._--Great Pan is dead.[267]   695  _Susceperunt verbum cum omni aviditate, scrutantes Scripturas, si ita se haberent._[268]   696  _Prodita lege._--_Impleta cerne._--_Implenda collige._   697  We understand the prophecies only when we see the events happen. 
第694章_预言._--大潘死了。[267] 695 _Susceperunt verbum cumOmni aviditate, scrutantes Scripturas, si ita se haberent._[268] 696 _Prodita Lege._--_Impleta cerne._--_Implenda collige._ 697 只有当我们看到事件发生时，我们才能理解预言。
Thus the proofs of retreat, discretion, silence, etc. 
因此，撤退、谨慎、沉默等的证据。
are proofs only to those who know and believe them. 
只为那些了解并相信它们的人提供证据。
 Joseph so internal in a law so external. 
约瑟对律法如此内向，如此外在。
 Outward penances dispose to inward, as humiliations to humility. 
外在的苦行应对内在，正如羞辱应对谦卑。
Thus the ... 
就这样 ...
  698  The synagogue has preceded the church; the Jews, the Christians. 
 698 犹太教堂先于教堂；犹太人、基督徒。
The prophets have foretold the Christians; Saint John, Jesus Christ. 
先知们已经预言了基督徒；圣约翰，耶稣基督。
  699  It is glorious to see with the eyes of faith the history of Herod and of Cæsar. 
 699 用信仰的眼睛看到希律和凯撒的历史是光荣的。
  700  The zeal of the Jews for their law and their temple (Josephus, and Philo the Jew, _Ad Caïum_). 
 700 犹太人对他们的法律和圣殿的热情（约瑟夫和犹太人斐罗，_Ad Caïum_）。
What other people had such a zeal? It was necessary they should have it. 
还有谁有这样的热情？他们有必要拥有它。
 Jesus Christ foretold as to the time and the state of the world. 
耶稣基督预言了世界的时间和状况。
The ruler taken from the thigh,[269] and the fourth monarchy. 
从大腿上取下的统治者，[269]和第四个君主制。
How lucky we are to see this light amidst this darkness!  How fine it is to see, with the eyes of faith, Darius and Cyrus, Alexander, the Romans, Pompey and Herod working, without knowing it, for the glory of the Gospel!   701  Zeal of the Jewish people for the law, especially after there were no more prophets. 
能在黑暗中看到光明，我们是多么幸运！用信仰的眼睛看到大流士和居鲁士、亚历山大、罗马人、庞培和希律在不知不觉中为福音的荣耀而工作，这是多么美好啊！ 701 犹太人对律法的热情，特别是在不再有先知之后。
  702  While the prophets were for maintaining the law, the people were indifferent. 
 702 当先知们维护法律时，人们却漠不关心。
But since there have been no more prophets, zeal has succeeded them. 
但自从不再有先知之后，热心就接替了他们。
  703  The devil troubled the zeal of the Jews before Jesus Christ, because he would have been their salvation, but not since. 
 703 魔鬼扰乱了犹太人在耶稣基督面前的热心，因为他本来是他们的拯救者，但从那以后就没有了。
 The Jewish people scorned by the Gentiles; the Christian people persecuted. 
犹太人被外邦人蔑视；基督徒受到迫害。
  704  _Proof._--Prophecies with their fulfilment; what has preceded and what has followed Jesus Christ. 
第704章耶稣基督之前的事和之后的事。
  705  The prophecies are the strongest proof of Jesus Christ. 
 705 预言是耶稣基督最有力的证据。
It is for them also that God has made most provision; for the event which has fulfilled them is a miracle existing since the birth of the Church to the end. 
上帝也为他们做了最多的安排。因为实现它们的事件是自教会诞生以来一直存在的奇迹。
So God has raised up prophets during sixteen hundred years, and, during four hundred years afterwards, He has scattered all these prophecies among all the Jews, who carried them into all parts of the world. 
因此，神在一千六百年间兴起了先知，在之后的四百年间，他将所有这些预言散布在所有犹太人中间，他们将这些预言带到了世界各地。
Such was the preparation for the birth of Jesus Christ, and, as His Gospel was to be believed by all the world, it was not only necessary that there should be prophecies to make it believed, but that these prophecies should exist throughout the whole world, in order to make it embraced by the whole world. 
这就是耶稣基督诞生的准备，由于他的福音要被全世界相信，因此不仅需要有预言来让人相信，而且这些预言应该存在于全世界，以使其受到全世界的欢迎。
  706  But it was not enough that the prophecies should exist. 
 706 但预言存在还不够。
It was necessary that they should be distributed throughout all places, and preserved throughout all times. 
有必要将它们分发到各个地方，并保存到各个时代。
And in order that this agreement might not be taken for an effect of chance, it was necessary that this should be foretold. 
为了不让这个协议被视为偶然的结果，有必要对此进行预言。
 It is far more glorious for the Messiah that the Jews should be the spectators, and even the instruments of His glory, besides that God had reserved them. 
对于弥赛亚来说，除了上帝保留他们之外，犹太人应该成为他荣耀的旁观者，甚至是他荣耀的工具，这是更加荣耀的。
  707  _Prophecies._--The time foretold by the state of the Jewish people, by the state of the heathen, by the state of the temple, by the number of years. 
 707_预言._--犹太人民的状态、异教徒的状态、圣殿的状态、年数所预言的时间。
  708  One must be bold to predict the same thing in so many ways. 
 708 一个人必须大胆地以多种方式预测同一件事。
It was necessary that the four idolatrous or pagan monarchies, the end of the kingdom of Judah, and the seventy weeks, should happen at the same time, and all this before the second temple was destroyed. 
四个偶像崇拜或异教君主国、犹大王国的终结和七十个七必须同时发生，而这一切都在第二座圣殿被毁之前发生。
  709  _Prophecies._--If one man alone had made a book of predictions about Jesus Christ, as to the time and the manner, and Jesus Christ had come in conformity to these prophecies, this fact would have infinite weight. 
 709_预言。_--如果一个人单独写了一本关于耶稣基督的预言书，预言了时间和方式，而耶稣基督的到来符合这些预言，那么这个事实将具有无限的分量。
 But there is much more here. 
但这里还有更多。
Here is a succession of men during four thousand years, who, consequently and without variation, come, one after another, to foretell this same event. 
四千年来，一连串的人，因此而没有变化地，一个接一个地来预言同一事件。
Here is a whole people who announce it, and who have existed for four thousand years, in order to give corporate testimony of the assurances which they have, and from which they cannot be diverted by whatever threats and persecutions people may make against them. 
这是一个已经存在了四千年的全体人民，他们宣布了这一点，以便为他们所拥有的保证提供集体见证，并且他们不会因人们可能对他们进行的任何威胁和迫害而偏离这一保证。
This is far more important. 
这要重要得多。
  710  _Predictions of particular things._--They were strangers in Egypt, without any private property, either in that country or elsewhere. 
 710_对特定事物的预测。_--他们在埃及是陌生人，没有任何私有财产，无论是在那个国家还是在其他地方。
[There was not the least appearance, either of the royalty which had previously existed so long, or of that supreme council of seventy judges which they called the _Sanhedrin_, and which, having been instituted by Moses, lasted to the time of Jesus Christ. 
 [没有丝毫出现，无论是先前存在已久的王室，还是由七十名法官组成的最高委员会，他们称之为“公会”，该委员会由摩西设立，一直持续到耶稣基督的时代。
All these things were as far removed from their state at that time as they could be], when Jacob, dying, and blessing his twelve children, declared to them, that they would be proprietors of a great land, and foretold in particular to the family of Judah, that the kings, who would one day rule them, should be of his race; and that all his brethren should be their subjects; [and that even the Messiah, who was to be the expectation of nations, should spring from him; and that the kingship should not be taken away from Judah, nor the ruler and law-giver of his descendants, till the expected Messiah should arrive in his family]. 
所有这些事情都与当时的情况相去甚远]，当雅各临死时，祝福他的十二个孩子，向他们宣布，他们将成为一大片土地的所有者，并特别预言到犹大家族的国王，有一天统治他们的国王应该是他的种族；他所有的弟兄都应该成为他们的臣民； [甚至万国期待的弥赛亚也应从他那里诞生；在预期的弥赛亚降临到他的家族中之前，王权不应被剥夺，犹大及其后裔的统治者和立法者也不应被剥夺]。
 This same Jacob, disposing of this future land as though he had been its ruler, gave a portion to Joseph more than to the others. 
这位雅各在处理这片未来的土地时，就好像他是这片土地的统治者一样，他给约瑟的一份比给其他人的多。
"I give you, said he, ""one part more than to your brothers."" And blessing his two children, Ephraim and Manasseh, whom Joseph had presented to him, the elder, Manasseh, on his right, and the young Ephraim on his left, he put his arms crosswise, and placing his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and his left on Manasseh, he blessed them in this manner. "
他说，我给你的，“比给你兄弟的多一份。”他祝福约瑟送给他的两个孩子以法莲和玛拿西，长子玛拿西在他的右边，小以法莲在他的左边，他交叉双臂，把右手放在以法莲的头上。 ，他离开玛拿西，他以这种方式祝福他们。
"And, upon Joseph's representing to him that he was preferring the younger, he replied to him with admirable resolution: ""I know it well, my son; but Ephraim will increase more than Manasseh."" This has been indeed so true in the result, that, being alone almost as fruitful as the two entire lines which composed a whole kingdom, they have been usually called by the name of Ephraim alone. "
当约瑟向他表示自己更喜欢小儿子时，他以令人钦佩的决心回答他：“我儿，我很清楚；但以法莲的人数必比玛拿西的人数更多。”结果确实如此，因为他们几乎与组成整个王国的两个完整世系一样富有成果，因此通常只用以法莲这个名字来称呼他们。

 [事实上，他宣称上帝要从他们的国家和种族中兴起一位先知，他就是先知的预表；他准确地预言了他们在他死后将要进入的土地上将发生的一切，上帝将赐予他们的胜利，他们对上帝的忘恩负义，他们将因此受到的惩罚，以及其他的事情。他们的冒险。]他给了他们一些法官来进行划分。

"But there is a God in heaven who can do so, and that hath revealed to thee in thy dream what shall be in the latter days,"" (This dream must have caused him much misgiving.)  ""And it is not by my own wisdom that I have knowledge of this secret, but by the revelation of this same God, that hath revealed it to me, to make it manifest in thy presence. "
但天上有一位神能够做到这一点，并且他已在你的梦中向你启示了后期的日子。”（这个梦一定让他深感疑虑。）“这并不是我自己的智慧。我知道这个秘密，但通过同一位上帝的启示，他向我启示了它，并使其在你面前显现。
" ""Thy dream was then of this kind. "
 “那时你的梦想就是这样的。
Thou sawest a great image, high and terrible, which stood before thee. 
你看到一个巨大的形象，高大而可怕，矗立在你面前。
His head was of gold, his breast and arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay. 
他的头是金的，他的胸部和手臂是银的，他的腹部和大腿是黄铜的，他的腿是铁的，他的脚一半是铁，一半是粘土。
Thus thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet, that were of iron and of clay, and brake them to pieces. 
你就这样看见，直到有一块非人手凿出来的石头，将神像打在他的脚上，脚上是铁的和粘土的，把它们打碎了。
" ""Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together, and the wind carried them away; but this stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth. "
“然后，铁、泥、铜、银、金都碎成了碎片，被风吹走了；但这块石头打碎了像，变成了一座大山，充满了整个大地。
This is the dream, and now I will give thee the interpretation thereof. 
这就是梦，现在我给你解梦。
" ""Thou who art the greatest of kings, and to whom God hath given a power so vast that thou art renowned among all peoples, art the head of gold which thou hast seen. "
 “你是最伟大的国王，上帝赋予你如此巨大的权力，使你在万民中享有盛誉，你是你所见过的金头。
But after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth. 
但在你之后，将兴起另一个比你低等的王国，另一个第三个黄铜王国，它将统治整个地球。
" ""But the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron, and even as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things, so shall this empire break in pieces and bruise all. "
 “但第四个王国将像铁一样强大，就像铁能打碎并征服万物一样，这个帝国也将打碎并压伤一切。
" ""And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of iron and of the weakness of clay. "
 “虽然你看到脚和脚趾，一部分是粘土，一部分是铁，王国将被分裂；但其中将有铁的力量和粘土的弱点。
" ""But as iron cannot be firmly mixed with clay, so they who are represented by the iron and by the clay, shall not cleave one to another though united by marriage. "
“但是，正如铁不能与泥土牢固地混合一样，以铁和泥土为代表的人，虽然通过婚姻结合在一起，却不能将彼此结合在一起。
" ""Now in the days of these kings shall God set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed, nor ever be delivered up to other people. "
 “在这些君王的时代，上帝将建立一个王国，它永远不会被毁灭，也不会被交付给其他民族。
It shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever, according as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it fell from the mountain, and brake in pieces the iron, the clay, the silver, and the gold. 
它将粉碎并毁灭所有这些王国，而它将永远矗立，正如你所看到的，这块石头不是人手从山上凿出来的，它从山上掉下来，把铁、铁、石头都打碎了。粘土、银和金。
God hath made known to thee what shall come to pass hereafter. 
上帝已经让你知道以后将要发生的事情。

 Daniel viii, 8. 
但以理八世，8.
"Daniel having seen the combat of the ram and of the he-goat, who vanquished him and ruled over the earth, whereof the principal horn being broken four others came up toward the four winds of heaven, and out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceedingly great toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the land of Israel, and it waxed great even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the stars, and stamped upon them, and at last overthrew the prince, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down. _x000D_
 This is what Daniel saw. "
但以理目睹了公绵羊和公山羊的战斗，公羊战胜了他并统治了地球，其中的主角被折断，另外四个角向着天上的四风上升，其中一个从其中发出了一股力量。小角，向着南方，向着东方，向着以色列地，向着天上的万象，向着极其巨大的角。它扔下一些星星，踩在它们身上，最后推翻了王子，每天的献祭被他拿走了，他的圣所也被拆毁了。 _x000D_ 这就是丹尼尔所看到的。
"He sought the meaning of it, and a voice cried in this manner, 'Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision,' And Gabriel said:  ""The ram which thou sawest is the king of the Medes and Persians, and the he-goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king of this monarchy. "
他寻找它的意义，一个声音以这种方式喊道：“加百列，让这个人明白这个异象。”加百列说：“你所看到的公羊是玛代人和波斯人的国王，他——山羊是希腊的国王，他两眼之间的大角是这个君主国的第一位国王。
" ""Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power. "
“既然被打破了，虽然有四个国家挺身而出，但四个王国将从这个国家中崛起，但不在他的权力之下。
" ""And in the latter time of their kingdom, when iniquities are come to the full, there shall arise a king, insolent and strong, but not by his own power, to whom all things shall succeed after his own will; and he shall destroy the holy people, and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand, and he shall destroy many. "
 “在他们王国的后期，当罪孽达到最大程度时，将会出现一个傲慢而强大的国王，但不是靠他自己的力量，一切都将按照他自己的意愿进行；他将毁灭神圣的人民，通过他的政策，他也将使手艺在他手中繁荣，他将毁灭许多人。
"He shall also stand up against the Prince of princes, but he shall perish miserably, and nevertheless by a violent hand.""  Daniel ix, 20. "
他也将站起来对抗万王之王，但他将悲惨地灭亡，而且是死于暴力之手。”但以理九，20。
"Whilst I was praying with all my heart, and confessing my sin and the sin of all my people, and prostrating myself before my God, even Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came to me and touched me about the time of the evening oblation, and he informed me and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to give thee the knowledge of things. _x000D_
At the beginning of thy supplications I came to shew that which thou didst desire, for thou are greatly beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the vision. _x000D_
Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to abolish iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness; to accomplish the vision and the prophecies, and to anoint the Most Holy. _x000D_
(After which this people shall be no more thy people, nor this city the holy city. _x000D_
The times of wrath shall be passed, and the years of grace shall come for ever.)  Know therefore, and understand, that, from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince, shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks."" (The Hebrews were accustomed to divide numbers, and to place the small first. "
当我全心全意地祈祷，承认我的罪和我所有人民的罪，并在我的上帝面前俯伏时，甚至我在开始的异象中看到的加百列也来到我身边，并触摸了我关于这件事的事。晚上献祭的时候，他通知我说，丹尼尔啊，我现在出来给你知识。 _x000D_ 在你的恳求开始时，我来展示你所渴望的，因为你深受爱戴：因此请理解此事，并考虑这个异象。 _x000D_ 七十个七已决定临到你的子民和你的圣城，以结束罪恶，结束罪恶，废除罪孽，带来永远的公义；实现异象和预言，并膏抹至圣者。 _x000D_ （此后，这个人民将不再是你的人民，这座城市也不再是圣城。_x000D_ 愤怒的时代将过去，恩典的岁月将永远到来。） 因此要知道并理解，从为弥赛亚君王恢复和建造耶路撒冷的命令发出，需要七个星期，又是三个星期又两个星期。”（希伯来人习惯于划分数字，并把小的放在第一位。
Thus, 7 and 62 make 69. 
因此，7 和 62 等于 69。
"Of this 70 there will then remain the 70th, that is to say, the 7 last years of which he will speak next.)  ""The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. "
在这70年中，还剩下第70年，也就是说，他接下来要谈到的最后7年。）“即使在动荡的时期，街道和城墙也将被重新修建。
"And after three score and two weeks,"" (which have followed the first seven. "
经过两周的三分”（紧随前七分之后。
"Christ will then be killed after the sixty-nine weeks, that is to say, in the last week), ""the Christ shall be cut off, and a people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary, and overwhelm all, and the end of that war shall accomplish the desolation.""  ""Now one week,"" (which is the seventieth, which remains), ""shall confirm the covenant with many, and in the midst of the week,"" (that is to say, the last three and a half years), ""he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.""  Daniel xi. "
基督将在六十九七之后被杀，也就是说，在最后一周），“基督将被剪除，来的君王的子民将摧毁这城和圣所，并压倒一切”。一切，战争的结束将带来荒凉。” “现在一个七，”（即剩下的第七十个），“要与许多人坚立这约，并且在一七的中间，”（也就是说，最后三年半），“他他将使祭祀和供奉停止，并且由于可憎之事的蔓延，他将使它荒凉，直到完成，而那决定的将倾倒在荒凉的人身上。”丹尼尔奚.
"The angel said to Daniel: There shall stand up yet, (after Cyrus, under whom this still is), ""three kings in Persia,"" (Cambyses, Smerdis, Darius); ""and the fourth who shall then come,"" (Xerxes) ""shall be far richer than they all, and far stronger, and shall stir up all his people against the Greeks. "
天使对但以理说：“波斯的三王”（冈比西斯、斯梅尔迪斯、大流士）将站起来（在居鲁士之后，现在仍然在他的统治下）； “随后到来的第四个，”（薛西斯）“将比他们所有人更加富有，也更加强大，并将煽动他的全体人民反对希腊人。
" ""But a mighty king shall stand up,"" (Alexander), ""that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will. "
 “但一个强大的国王将站起来，”（亚历山大），“他将以强大的统治力进行统治，并按照他的意愿行事。
"And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided in four parts toward the four winds of heaven,"" (as he had said above, vii, 6; viii, 8), ""but not his posterity; and his successors shall not equal his power, for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others besides these,"" (his four chief successors). "
当他站起来时，他的王国将被打破，并将被天上的四风分成四部分”（正如他在上面所说的，vii，6；viii，8），“但不是他的后裔；他的继承者将无法与他的权力相媲美，因为他的王国将被拔除，甚至为除这些之外的其他人所夺取”（他的四位主要继承人）。
" ""And the king of the south,"" (Ptolemy, son of Lagos, Egypt), ""shall be strong; but one of his princes shall be strong above him, and his dominion shall be a great dominion,"" (Seleucus, King of Syria. "
“南方之王”（埃及拉各斯之子托勒密）“将强大；但他的一位王子将比他更强大，他的统治将是一个伟大的统治”（埃及国王塞琉古）叙利亚。
Appian says that he was the most powerful of Alexander's successors). 
阿庇安说他是亚历山大的继承者中最有权势的人）。
" ""And in the end of years they shall join themselves together, and the king's daughter of the south,"" (Berenice, daughter of Ptolemy Philadelphus, son of the other Ptolemy), ""shall come to the king of the north,"" (to Antiochus Deus, King of Syria and of Asia, son of Seleucus Lagidas), ""to make peace between these princes. "
 “在岁月的最后，他们将联合起来，南方国王的女儿，”（另一个托勒密的儿子托勒密·菲拉德尔菲斯的女儿贝伦尼斯），“将来到北方国王那里，”（到安条克·德乌斯（Antiochus Deus），叙利亚和亚洲国王，塞琉古·拉吉达斯（Seleucus Lagidas）之子），“在这些王子之间缔结和平。
" ""But neither she nor her seed shall have a long authority; for she and they that brought her, and her children, and her friends, shall be delivered to death."" (Berenice and her son were killed by Seleucus Callinicus.)  ""But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up,"" (Ptolemy Euergetes was the issue of the same father as Berenice), ""which shall come with a mighty army into the land of the king of the north, where he shall put all under subjection, and he shall also carry captive into Egypt their gods, their princes, their gold, their silver, and all their precious spoils,"" (if he had not been called into Egypt by domestic reasons, says Justin, he would have entirely stripped Seleucus); ""and he shall continue several years when the king of the north can do nought against him. "
“但她和她的后裔都不会拥有长久的权威；因为她和那些带她来的人，以及她的孩子和她的朋友，都将被处死。” （贝勒尼丝和她的儿子被塞琉古·卡利尼库斯杀死。）“但从她的根部中将有一个人站起来，”（托勒密尤尔盖特斯是贝勒尼丝同一个父亲的后代），“它将带着一支强大的军队进入北方王的土地，在那里他将征服一切，他还将把他们的神、他们的首领、他们的金银和一切珍贵的战利品掳到埃及。”贾斯汀说，由于国内原因被召唤到埃及，他会完全剥夺塞琉古的权利）； “当北方王无法对付他时，他将继续数年。
" ""And so he shall return into his kingdom. "
 “这样他就会回到他的王国。
"But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces,"" (Seleucus Ceraunus, Antiochus the Great). "
但他的儿子们将被煽动，并聚集一支强大的军队”（塞琉古·塞劳努斯，安条克大帝）。
"And their army shall come and overthrow all; wherefore the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall also form a great army, and fight him, (Ptolemy Philopator against Antiochus the Great at Raphia), ""and conquer; and his troops shall become insolent, and his heart shall be lifted up,"" (this Ptolemy desecrated the temple; Josephus): ""he shall cast down many ten thousands, but he shall not be strengthened by it. "
他们的军队必来推翻一切；因此，南方之王将被激怒，也将组建一支大军，与他作战（托勒密·菲洛帕托在拉菲亚对抗安条克大帝），“并征服；他的军队将变得傲慢，他的心将被举起来，”（托勒密亵渎了圣殿；约瑟夫斯）：“他将击倒成千上万的人，但他不会因此而坚强。
"For the king of the north,"" (Antiochus the Great), ""shall return with a greater multitude than before, and in those times also a great number of enemies shall stand up against the king of the south,"" (during the reign of the young Ptolemy Epiphanes); ""also the apostates and robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall."" (Those who abandon their religion to please Euergetes, when he will send his troops to Scopas; for Antiochus will again take Scopas, and conquer them.) ""And the king of the north shall destroy the fenced cities, and the arms of the south shall not withstand, and all shall yield to his will; he shall stand in the land of Israel, and it shall yield to him. "
因为北方之王”（安提阿古大帝）“将带着比以前更多的军队返回，那时，也会有大量的敌人起来对抗南方之王”（在安条克大帝统治期间）年轻的托勒密·埃皮法尼斯）；“你人民中的背道者和强盗也将高举自己以建立异象；但他们会倒下。”（那些为了取悦尤尔盖特斯而放弃宗教的人，当他派遣军队去斯科帕斯时；因为安提阿古斯将再次占领斯科帕斯，并征服他们。）“北方之王将摧毁有围栏的城市，南方的军队无法抵挡，一切都将屈服于他的意志；他必站立在以色列地，以色列地也必归给他。
"And thus he shall think to make himself master of all the empire of Egypt,"" (despising the youth of Epiphanes, says Justin). "
因此他会想成为整个埃及帝国的主人”（贾斯汀鄙视埃皮法尼斯的年轻人）。
And for that he shall make alliance with him, and give his daughter (Cleopatra, in order that she may betray her husband. 
为此，他将与他结盟，并将他的女儿（克利奥帕特拉）赐给她，以便她背叛她的丈夫。
On which Appian says that doubting his ability to make himself master of Egypt by force, because of the protection of the Romans, he wished to attempt it by cunning). 
对此，阿庇安说，由于罗马人的保护，他怀疑自己是否有能力通过武力成为埃及的主人，因此他希望通过狡猾的方式来尝试。
"He shall wish to corrupt her, but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him. _x000D_
Then he shall turn his face to other designs, and shall think to make himself master of some isles, (that is to say, seaports), ""and shall take many,"" (as Appian says). "
他想败坏她，但她不会站在他一边，也不会为他服务。 _x000D_ 然后他将转向其他计划，并考虑使自己成为某些岛屿的主人（也就是说，海港），“并占领许多岛屿”（如阿皮安所说）。
" ""But a prince shall oppose his conquests,"" (Scipio Africanus, who stopped the progress of Antiochus the Great, because he offended the Romans in the person of their allies), ""and shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease. "
 “但是，王子应该反对他的征服，”（西庇阿·非洲人，他阻止了安条克大帝的前进，因为他冒犯了罗马人的盟友），“并且应该使他所提出的谴责停止。
"He shall then return into his kingdom and there perish, and be no more."" (He was slain by his soldiers.)  ""And he who shall stand up in his estate,"" (Seleucus Philopator or Soter, the son of Antiochus the Great), ""shall be a tyrant, a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom,"" (which means the people), ""but within a few days he shall be destroyed, neither in anger nor in battle. "
然后他将回到他的王国，在那里灭亡，不再存在。”（他被他的士兵杀死了。）“谁将在他的庄园中站起来”（塞琉古·菲洛帕托或索特，安条克大帝的儿子） ），“将成为一个暴君，为了王国的荣耀而征税的人，”（这意味着人民），“但在几天之内，他将被毁灭，无论是在愤怒中还是在战斗中。
And in his place shall stand up a vile person, unworthy of the honour of the kingdom, but he shall come in cleverly by flatteries. 
取而代之的是一个卑鄙的人，不配得到王国的荣耀，但他会通过奉承巧妙地进来。
All armies shall bend before him; he shall conquer them, and even the prince with whom he has made a covenant. 
所有的军队都将臣服于他；他将征服他们，甚至是与他立约的王子。
For having renewed the league with him, he shall work deceitfully, and enter with a small people into his province, peaceably and without fear. 
因为与他续约后，他将行诡诈的工作，并与一小群人和平地、毫无恐惧地进入他的省份。
He shall take the fattest places, and shall do that which his fathers have not done, and ravage on all sides. 
他必占领最肥沃的地方，做他列祖未曾做过的事，蹂躏四面八方。

 And it happened that in the fourth monarchy, before the destruction of the second temple, etc., the heathen in great number worshipped God, and led an angelic life.

那么你心里会说：我失去了我的孩子，我孤苦伶仃，沦为俘虏，四处漂泊，谁给我生了这些呢？谁提出了这些？看哪，只剩下我一个人了；这些，他们去哪儿了？主将对你说：看哪，我要向外邦举起我的手，向万民立起我的旗帜；他们会把你的儿子抱在怀里。
And kings shall be their nursing fathers, and queens their nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.

Shall the prey be taken from the mighty? But even if the captives be taken away from the strong, nothing shall hinder me from saving thy children, and from destroying thy enemies; and all flesh shall know that I am the Lord, thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob. 
难道要从强者手中夺取猎物吗？但即使俘虏被从强者手中夺走，也没有什么能阻止我拯救你的孩子，消灭你的敌人；所有有血气的人都会知道我是主，你的救主和你的救赎主，雅各的大能者。
" ""Thus saith the Lord: What is the bill of this divorcement, wherewith I have put away the synagogue? and why have I delivered it into the hands of your enemies?

 “那称我为义的人就在附近；谁能与我相争？谁能成为我的对手，并指控我有罪，上帝自己是我的保护者？”所有人都会消逝，并被时间所吞噬；敬畏上帝的人，愿听他仆人的声音；让那些在黑暗中衰弱的人信赖耶和华。
But as for you, ye do but kindle the wrath of God upon you; ye walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have kindled.

 “主说，银子是我的，金子是我的”（也就是说，我不想因此而受到荣耀；正如别处所说：田野里的一切走兽都是我的，他们为我提供牺牲对我有什么好处？）。

偶像的庙宇将被拆毁，在所有国家和地球上的所有地方，他将被献为纯洁的祭物，而不是野兽。
 That He would be king of the Jews and Gentiles. 
他将成为犹太人和外邦人的王。
And we see this king of the Jews and Gentiles oppressed by both, who conspire His death; and ruler of both, destroying the worship of Moses in Jerusalem, which was its centre, where He made His first Church; and also the worship of idols in Rome, the centre of it, where He made His chief Church. 
我们看到这位犹太人和外邦人的王受到双方的压迫，他们密谋杀害他；他是两者的统治者，摧毁了耶路撒冷对摩西的崇拜，耶路撒冷是耶路撒冷的中心，他在那里建立了他的第一个教会；还有罗马的偶像崇拜，罗马是罗马的中心，他在那里建立了他的主要教堂。

And if I knew that these same books foretold a Messiah, I should be sure that He would come; and seeing that they place His time before the destruction of the second temple, I should say that He had come.

选民将毫无结果、忘恩负义、不信，_populum non credentem et contradicentem_。[275]上帝会让他们失明，在正午时分，他们会像瞎子一样摸索；并有一位先驱走在他的前面。

 That a deliverer should come, who would crush the demon's head, and free His people from their sins, _ex omnibus iniquitatibus_; that there should be a New Covenant, which would be eternal; that there should be another priesthood after the order of Melchisedek, and it should be eternal; that the Christ should be glorious, mighty, strong, and yet so poor that He would not be recognised, nor taken for what He is, but rejected and slain; that His people who denied Him should no longer be His people; that the idolaters should receive Him, and take refuge in Him; that He should leave Zion to reign in the centre of idolatry; that nevertheless the Jews should continue for ever; that He should be of Judah, and when there should be no longer a king. 
一位拯救者将会到来，他会粉碎恶魔的头颅，并将他的子民从他们的罪恶中解放出来，_ex omnibus iniquitatibus_；应该有一个永恒的新约；在麦基洗德等次之后应该有另一个祭司职分，而且它应该是永恒的；基督应当是荣耀的、大能的、刚强的，但又如此贫穷，以至于他不会被认出，也不会被认为是他，而是被拒绝和杀害；那些否认他的人不再是他的子民；拜偶像的人应该接受他，并投靠他；他应该让锡安在偶像崇拜的中心统治；尽管如此，犹太人仍应永远延续下去；当不再有国王时，他应该属于犹大。
    SECTION XII  PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST   736  ... 
第十二节耶稣基督的证据 736 ...
Therefore I reject all other religions. 
因此我拒绝所有其他宗教。
In that way I find an answer to all objections. 
通过这种方式，我找到了所有反对意见的答案。
It is right that a God so pure should only reveal Himself to those whose hearts are purified. 
如此纯洁的神应该只向心灵纯洁的人显现，这是正确的。
Hence this religion is lovable to me, and I find it now sufficiently justified by so divine a morality. 
因此，这个宗教对我来说是可爱的，我发现它现在已经被如此神圣的道德所充分证明是合理的。
But I find more in it. 
但我在其中发现了更多。
 I find it convincing that, since the memory of man has lasted, it was constantly announced to men that they were universally corrupt, but that a Redeemer should come; that it was not one man who said it, but innumerable men, and a whole nation expressly made for the purpose, and prophesying for four thousand years. 
我发现令人信服的是，自从人类的记忆延续以来，人们就不断地向人们宣布，他们普遍腐败，但救赎主应该到来；说这句话的不是一个人，而是无数的人和一个专门为此目的而创造的整个国家，并且已经预言了四千年。
This is a nation which is more ancient than every other nation. 
这是一个比其他任何民族都更加古老的民族。
Their books, scattered abroad, are four thousand years old. 
他们的书籍散布在国外，已有四千年的历史。
 The more I examine them, the more truths I find in them: an entire nation foretell Him before His advent, and an entire nation worship Him after His advent; what has preceded and what has followed; in short, people without idols and kings, this synagogue which was foretold, and these wretches who frequent it, and who, being our enemies, are admirable witnesses of the truth of these prophecies, wherein their wretchedness and even their blindness are foretold. 
我越考察越发现其中的真理：他未降临之前，全国人民都预言他；他降临之后，全国人民都敬拜他；之前发生的事情和之后发生的事情；简而言之，没有偶像和国王的人们，没有这个被预言的犹太教堂，以及这些经常光顾它的不幸者，他们是我们的敌人，是这些预言的真实性的令人钦佩的见证人，其中预言了他们的不幸，甚至他们的盲目。
 I find this succession, this religion, wholly divine in its authority, in its duration, in its perpetuity, in its morality, in its conduct, in its doctrine, in its effects. 
我发现这种继承、这种宗教在其权威、其持续性、其永恒性、其道德、其行为、其教义及其效果上都是完全神圣的。
The frightful darkness of the Jews was foretold: _Eris palpans in meridie.[276] Dabitur liber scienti literas, et dicet: Non possum legere._[277] While the sceptre was still in the hands of the first foreign usurper, there is the report of the coming of Jesus Christ. 
预言了犹太人可怕的黑暗：_Eris palpans in meridie。[276] Dabitur liber scienti literas, et dicet: Non possumlegere._[277] 当权杖仍在第一个外国篡夺者手中时，就有了耶稣基督降临的报道。
 So I hold out my arms to my _Redeemer_, who, having been foretold for four thousand years, has come to suffer and to die for me on earth, at the time and under all the circumstances foretold. 
因此，我向我的救赎主伸出双臂，他四千年来就被预言，在预言的时间和所有的情况下，来到地球上为我受苦和死亡。
By His grace, I await death in peace, in the hope of being eternally united to Him. 
靠着他的恩典，我平静地等待死亡，希望与他永远结合。
Yet I live with joy, whether in the prosperity which it pleases Him to bestow upon me, or in the adversity which He sends for my good, and which He has taught me to bear by His example. 
然而，无论是在他乐意赐予我的繁荣中，还是在他为了我的利益而赐予我的逆境中，以及他以身作则教导我承受逆境时，我都充满喜乐地生活。
  737  The prophecies having given different signs which should all happen at the advent of the Messiah, it was necessary that all these signs should occur at the same time. 
 737 预言给出了不同的征兆，这些征兆都将在弥赛亚降临时发生，因此所有这些征兆必须同时发生。
So it was necessary that the fourth monarchy should have come, when the seventy weeks of Daniel were ended; and that the sceptre should have then departed from Judah. 
因此，当但以理的七十个七结束时，第四个君主制就必然到来。那时权杖就应该离开犹大了。
And all this happened without any difficulty. 
而这一切都毫无困难地发生了。
Then it was necessary that the Messiah should come; and Jesus Christ then came, who was called the Messiah. 
那么弥赛亚就必须到来。然后耶稣基督来了，他被称为弥赛亚。
And all this again was without difficulty. 
而这一切又是毫无困难的。
This indeed shows the truth of the prophecies. 
这确实说明了预言的真实性。
  738  The prophets foretold, and were not foretold. 
 738 先知预言过，但没有被预言过。
The saints again were foretold, but did not foretell. 
圣徒再次被预言，但他们没有预言。
Jesus Christ both foretold and was foretold.

 739 耶稣基督，两部圣经都视他为旧约的希望，新约的典范，两者都是它们的中心。
  740  The two oldest books in the world are those of Moses and Job, the one a Jew and the other a Gentile. 
 740 世界上最古老的两本书是摩西和约伯的书，一本是犹太人的，另一本是外邦人的。
Both of them look upon Jesus Christ as their common centre and object: Moses in relating the promises of God to Abraham, Jacob, etc., and his prophecies; and Job, _Quis mihi det ut_,[278] etc. 
他们都以耶稣基督为共同的中心和对象：摩西讲述了神对亚伯拉罕、雅各等的应许和预言；摩西讲述了神对亚伯拉罕、雅各等人的应许和预言；和约伯，_Quis mihi det ut_，[278] 等。

第742章_耶稣基督的证据。_为什么路得记被保存下来？为什么要讲他玛的故事？ 743 “祈祷你们不要陷入诱惑。”[279] 受到诱惑是危险的；人们因为不祈祷而受到诱惑。

 The word, _Galilee_, which the Jewish mob pronounced as if by chance, in accusing Jesus Christ before Pilate, afforded Pilate a reason for sending Jesus Christ to Herod. 
 “加利利”这个词，是犹太暴民在彼拉多面前控告耶稣基督时偶然念出来的，这为彼拉多提供了将耶稣基督送去见希律王的理由。
And thereby the mystery was accomplished, that He should be judged by Jews and Gentiles. 
由此，他将受犹太人和外邦人审判的奥秘就完成了。
Chance was apparently the cause of the accomplishment of the mystery. 
显然，机遇是完成这个谜团的原因。
  744  Those who have a difficulty in believing seek a reason in the fact that the Jews do not believe. 
 744 那些难以相信的人会从犹太人不相信这一事实中寻找理由。
"Were this so clear, say they, ""why did the Jews not believe?"" And they almost wish that they had believed, so as not to be kept back by the example of their refusal. "
他们说，如果这一点如此清楚，“为什么犹太人不相信呢？”他们几乎希望自己曾经相信过，以免因拒绝而受挫。

如果他们站在我们这边，我们就不应该那么热衷于信仰。
We should then have a more ample pretext. 
那么我们应该有更充足的借口。
The wonderful thing is to have made the Jews great lovers of the things foretold, and great enemies of their fulfilment. 
奇妙的是，犹太人非常喜爱所预言的事情，却又非常反对预言的实现。
  745  The Jews were accustomed to great and striking miracles, and so, having had the great miracles of the Red Sea and of the land of Canaan as an epitome of the great deeds of their Messiah, they therefore looked for more striking miracles, of which those of Moses were only the patterns. 
 745 犹太人习惯了伟大而惊人的奇迹，因此，在红海和迦南地的伟大奇迹作为他们弥赛亚伟大事迹的缩影之后，他们因此寻找更惊人的奇迹，其中摩西的那些只是模式。
  746  The carnal Jews and the heathen have their calamities, and Christians also. 
 746 属肉体的犹太人和异教徒都有他们的灾难，基督徒也有。

"  748  ""If this was clearly foretold to the Jews, how did they not believe it, or why were they not destroyed for resisting a fact so clear?""  I reply: in the first place, it was foretold both that they would not believe a thing so clear, and that they would not be destroyed. "
 748 “如果这对犹太人有明确的预言，他们怎么不相信，或者为什么他们没有因为抵制如此明确的事实而被毁灭？”我回答：首先，有人预言他们不会相信如此明确的事情，而且他们也不会被毁灭。
And nothing is more to the glory of the Messiah; for it was not enough that there should be prophets; their prophets must be kept above suspicion. 
没有什么比弥赛亚的荣耀更重要的了；因为光有先知是不够的；他们的先知必须不受怀疑。
Now, etc. 
现在等等。
  749  If the Jews had all been converted by Jesus Christ, we should have none but questionable witnesses. 
 749 如果犹太人都因耶稣基督而皈依，那么我们所得到的证人就只能是值得怀疑的。
And if they had been entirely destroyed, we should have no witnesses at all. 
如果它们被完全摧毁，我们根本就没有目击者。
  750  What do the prophets say of Jesus Christ? That He will be clearly God? No; but that He is a God truly hidden; that He will be slighted; that none will think that it is He; that He will be a stone of stumbling, upon which many will stumble, etc. 
第750章 先知们如何评价耶稣基督？他显然是神吗？不;但他是一位真正隐藏的神；他会被轻视；没有人会认为那是他；他将成为一块绊脚石，许多人都会在上面绊倒，等等。
Let people then reproach us no longer for want of clearness, since we make profession of it. 
既然我们公开承认了这一点，人们就不要再指责我们不够清楚了。
 But, it is said, there are obscurities.--And without that, no one would have stumbled over Jesus Christ, and this is one of the formal pronouncements of the prophets: _Excæca_[280] ... 
但是，据说，有一些晦涩难懂的地方。--如果没有这些，没有人会绊倒耶稣基督，这是先知的正式声明之一：_Excæca_[280] ...

He prophesies, and his wonder comes to pass. 
他预言，他的奇迹就实现了。
This is infinite. 
这是无限的。
 He had only to say that he was the Messiah, if he had been vain; for the prophecies are clearer about him than about Jesus Christ. 
如果他是自负的话，他只需说他是弥赛亚即可。因为关于他的预言比关于耶稣基督的预言更清楚。
And the same with Saint John.

 In what way should the Messiah come, seeing that through Him the sceptre was to be eternally in Judah, and at His coming the sceptre was to be taken away from Judah?  In order to effect that seeing they should not see, and hearing they should not understand, nothing could be better done. 
弥赛亚应该以什么方式到来，因为通过他，权杖将永远留在犹大，而在他到来时，权杖将从犹大被夺走？为了达到看不该看，听不该明白的程度，这是最好的办法了。
  753  _Homo existens te Deum facit. 
第753章
 Scriptum est, Dii estis, et non potest solvi Scriptura. 
Scriptum est，Dii estis，et non potest solvi Scriptura。
 Hæc infirmitas non est ad vitam et est ad mortem. 
 Hæc infirmitas non est ad vitam et est ad mortem。
 Lazarus dormit, et deinde dixit: Lazarus mortuus est._[281]   754  The apparent discrepancy of the Gospels.[282]   755  What can we have but reverence for a man who foretells plainly things which come to pass, and who declares his intention both to blind and to enlighten, and who intersperses obscurities among the clear things which come to pass?   756  The time of the first advent was foretold; the time of the second is not so; because the first was to be obscure, and the second is to be brilliant, and so manifest that even His enemies will recognise it. 
Lazarus dormit, et deinde dixit: Lazarus mortuus est._[281] 754 福音书的明显差异。[282] 755 对于这样一个人，除了敬畏之外，我们还能有什么呢？ 756 第一次降临的时间已被预言；第二个时间则不然；因为第一个是晦涩难懂的，第二个是辉煌的，并且如此明显，甚至他的敌人也会认出它。
But, as He was first to come only in obscurity, and to be known only of those who searched the Scriptures ... 
但是，由于他最初只是在默默无闻中降临，并且只有那些查考圣经的人才能认识他……
  757  God, in order to cause the Messiah to be known by the good and not to be known by the wicked, made Him to be foretold in this manner. 
 757 神为了使弥赛亚被好人认识，而不被恶人认识，所以以这种方式预言了他。
If the manner of the Messiah had been clearly foretold, there would have been no obscurity, even for the wicked. 
如果弥赛亚的方式被清楚地预言，那么即使对恶人来说，也不会有任何晦涩难懂的事。
If the time had been obscurely foretold, there would have been obscurity, even for the good. 
如果这个时间被隐晦地预言，即使是好的，也会变得模糊。
For their [goodness of heart] would not have made them understand, for instance, that the closed _mem_ signifies six hundred years. 
因为他们的[善良的心]不会让他们明白，例如，封闭的记忆意味着六百年。
But the time has been clearly foretold, and the manner in types. 
但时间已被明确预言，方式也已预表。
 By this means, the wicked, taking the promised blessings for material blessings, have fallen into error, in spite of the clear prediction of the time; and the good have not fallen in error. 
通过这种方式，恶人将应许的祝福视为物质的祝福，从而陷入了错误，尽管当时有明确的预言。善行并没有犯错误。
"For the understanding of the promised blessings depends on the heart, which calls ""good"" that which it loves; but the understanding of the promised time does not depend on the heart. "
因为对所应许的祝福的理解取决于心，心将它所爱的称为“善”。但对约定时间的理解并不取决于内心。
And thus the clear prediction of the time, and the obscure prediction of the blessings, deceive the wicked alone. 
因此，清楚的时间预言和模糊的祝福预言只能欺骗恶人。
  758  [Either the Jews or the Christians must be wicked.]   759  The Jews reject Him, but not all. 
 758 [犹太人或基督徒一定是邪恶的。] 759 犹太人拒绝他，但不是所有人。
The saints receive Him, and not the carnal-minded. 
圣徒接受他，而不是体贴肉体的人。
And so far is this from being against His glory, that it is the last touch which crowns it. 
这绝不是违背他的荣耀，而是最后的修饰。
For their argument, the only one found in all their writings, in the Talmud and in the Rabbinical writings, amounts only to this, that Jesus Christ has not subdued the nations with sword in hand, _gladiumt uum, potentissime_.[283] (Is this all they have to say? Jesus Christ has been slain, say they. 
对于他们的论点，在他们的所有著作中，在《塔木德》和拉比著作中，唯一能找到的论点就是这一点，即耶稣基督没有用手中的剑征服列国，_gladiumt uum, potissime_。 [283] （这就是他们要说的全部吗？他们说，耶稣基督已经被杀了。
He has failed. 
他失败了。
He has not subdued the heathen with His might. 
他并没有用他的力量征服异教徒。
He has not bestowed upon us their spoil. 
他没有把他们的战利品赐给我们。
He does not give riches. 
他不给予财富。
Is this all they have to say? It is in this respect that He is lovable to me. 
这就是他们要说的全部吗？正是在这一点上，他对我来说是可爱的。
I would not desire Him whom they fancy.) It is evident that it is only His life which has prevented them from accepting Him; and through this rejection they are irreproachable witnesses, and, what is more, they thereby accomplish the prophecies. 
我不会渴望他们所想象的那个人。） 显然，只是他的生命阻止了他们接受他；因为他的生命阻止了他们接受他。通过这种拒绝，他们成为无可指责的见证人，而且，更重要的是，他们从而实现了预言。
 [By means of the fact that this people have not accepted Him, this miracle here has happened. 
 [由于这个民族还没有接受他，这个奇迹才在这里发生。
The prophecies were the only lasting miracles which could be wrought, but they were liable to be denied.]   760  The Jews, in slaying Him in order not to receive Him as the Messiah, have given Him the final proof of being the Messiah. 
这些预言是唯一可以实现的持久奇迹，但它们很容易被否认。] 760 犹太人为了不接受他为弥赛亚而杀害了他，从而给了他作为弥赛亚的最终证据。
 And in continuing not to recognise Him, they made themselves irreproachable witnesses. 
他们继续不承认他，从而使自己成为无可指责的见证人。
Both in slaying Him, and in continuing to deny Him, they have fulfilled the prophecies (Isa. 
他们杀害他，并继续否认他，都应验了预言（以赛亚书
lx; Ps. 
1x；诗。
lxxi). 
六十一）。
  761  What could the Jews, His enemies, do? If they receive Him, they give proof of Him by their reception; for then the guardians of the expectation of the Messiah receive Him. 
第761章 他的敌人犹太人能做什么？如果他们接受了他，他们就以他们的接受来证明他；因为那时弥赛亚的期待的守护者们就会接待他。
If they reject Him, they give proof of Him by their rejection. 
如果他们拒绝他，他们就以他们的拒绝来证明他。
  762  The Jews, in testing if He were God, have shown that He was man. 
 762 犹太人在检验他是否是神时，已经表明他是人。
  763  The Church has had as much difficulty in showing that Jesus Christ was man, against those who denied it, as in showing that he was God; and the probabilities were equally great. 
 763 教会在向那些否认它的人证明耶稣基督是人方面遇到了同样的困难，就像在证明他是神一样；而且可能性同样很大。
  764  _Source of contradictions._--A God humiliated, even to the death on the cross; a Messiah triumphing over death by his own death. 
764_矛盾之源。_--神受辱，甚至死在十字架上；弥赛亚以自己的死亡战胜了死亡。
Two natures in Jesus Christ, two advents, two states of man's nature. 
耶稣基督有两种本性，两种降临，人性的两种状态。
  765  _Types._--Saviour, father, sacrificer, offering, food, king, wise, law-giver, afflicted, poor, having to create a people whom He must lead and nourish, and bring into His land.... 
 765_类型._-救世主、父亲、牺牲者、奉献者、食物、国王、智者、立法者、受苦者、贫穷者，必须创造一个他必须领导和滋养的人民，并将他们带入他的土地……
 _Jesus Christ. 
 _耶稣基督。
Offices._--He alone had to create a great people, elect, holy, and chosen; to lead, nourish, and bring it into the place of rest and holiness; to make it holy to God; to make it the temple of God; to reconcile it to, and save it from, the wrath of God; to free it from the slavery of sin, which visibly reigns in man; to give laws to this people, and engrave these laws on their heart; to offer Himself to God for them, and sacrifice Himself for them; to be a victim without blemish, and Himself the sacrificer, having to offer Himself, His body, and His blood, and yet to offer bread and wine to God ... 
办公室。_--他必须独自创造一个伟大的人民，选民，神圣的和被选择的；带领、滋养、带入安息和圣洁的地方；使之归神为圣；使它成为神的殿；使其与上帝的愤怒和解，并将其从上帝的愤怒中拯救出来；将其从罪恶的奴役中解放出来，罪恶明显地统治着人类；为这个人民制定法律，并将这些法律铭刻在他们的心上；为他们献上自己，为他们牺牲自己；成为一个无瑕疵的受害者，而他自己则是牺牲者，必须献上自己、他的身体和他的血，同时还要向上帝献上饼和酒……
" _Ingrediens mundum._[284]  ""Stone upon stone.""[285]  What preceded and what followed. "
 _Ingrediens mundum._[284]“石头叠石头。”[285]之前发生的事情和之后发生的事情。
All the Jews exist still, and are wanderers. 
所有的犹太人仍然存在，并且都是流浪者。
  766  Of all that is on earth, He partakes only of the sorrows, not of the joys. 
 766 世间万物，他只受苦，不受乐。
He loves His neighbours, but His love does not confine itself within these bounds, and overflows to His own enemies, and then to those of God. 
他爱他的邻舍，但他的爱并不局限于这些范围内，而是溢出到他自己的敌人，然后是上帝的敌人。
  767  Jesus Christ typified by Joseph, the beloved of his father, sent by his father to see his brethren, etc., innocent, sold by his brethren for twenty pieces of silver, and thereby becoming their lord, their saviour, the saviour of strangers, and the saviour of the world; which had not been but for their plot to destroy him, their sale and their rejection of him. 
767 约瑟夫所预表的耶稣基督，是他父亲的挚爱，被他父亲派去见他的弟兄等，无辜的，被他的弟兄以二十块银子卖掉，从而成为他们的主，他们的救主，陌生人的救主，以及世界的救世主；这不是因为他们密谋摧毁他、出卖他并拒绝他。
 In prison Joseph innocent between two criminals; Jesus Christ on the cross between two thieves. 
在监狱里，约瑟夫在两个罪犯中间无辜；耶稣基督在两个强盗之间被钉在十字架上。

约瑟请求他，当他进入他的荣耀时，那些将要得救的人记得他。耶稣基督所拯救的人请求他在进入他的国度时记念他。
  768  The conversion of the heathen was only reserved for the grace of the Messiah.

在你杀死了葡萄园的继承人之后，我的使徒们将这样做。”然后使徒们对犹太人说：“你们将被诅咒，”（_塞尔苏斯嘲笑它_）；对异教徒说：“你们将进入知识神的旨意。”然后这事就发生了。
  770  Jesus Christ came to blind those who saw clearly, and to give sight to the blind; to heal the sick, and leave the healthy to die; to call to repentance, and to justify sinners, and to leave the righteous in their sins; to fill the needy, and leave the rich empty. 
770 耶稣基督来是为了叫那些看得清楚的人瞎眼，又让盲人重见光明；医治有病的人，让健康的人死去；呼吁悔改，称罪人为义，并让义人继续犯罪；使穷者得饱，使富者空虚。
  771  _Holiness._--_Effundam spiritum meum._[287] All nations were in unbelief and lust.

The whole world now became fervent with love.

 _Postula a me.[290] Adorabunt eum omnes reges.[291]睾丸不正常。[292] Dabit maxillam percutienti.[293] Dederunt fel in escam._[294] 773 耶稣基督为所有人，摩西为国家。

"  774  There is heresy in always explaining _omnes_ by ""all,"" and heresy in not explaining it sometimes by ""all."" _Bibite ex hoc omnes_;[299] the Huguenots are heretics in explaining it by ""all."" _In quo omnes peccaverunt_;[300] the Huguenots are heretics in excepting the children of true believers. "
 774 总是用“全部”来解释普遍性是异端，有时不用“全部”来解释也是异端。 _Bibite ex hoc omnes_；[299] 胡格诺派用“全部”来解释它，是异端。 _In quo omnes peccaverunt_;[300] 胡格诺派是异教徒，他们将真正信徒的孩子排除在外。
We must then follow the Fathers and tradition in order to know when to do so, since there is heresy to be feared on both sides. 
然后，我们必须遵循教父和传统，以便知道何时这样做，因为双方都害怕异端。
  775  _Ne timeas pusillus grex.[301] Timore et tremore.--Quid ergo? Ne timeas [modo] timeas._ Fear not, provided you fear; but if you fear not, then fear.

 _Qui me recipit, non me recipit, sed eum qui me misit._[302]  _Nemo scit, neque Filius._  _Nubes lucida obumbravit._  Saint John[303] was to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and Jesus Christ[304] to plant division. 
 _谁接待我，就不接待我，除了拜访我的 eum。_[302] _Nemo scit, neque Filius._ _Nubes lucida obumbravit._ 圣约翰[303] 要将父亲的心转向孩子们，而耶稣基督[304]植师。
There is not contradiction. 
这并不矛盾。
  776  The effects _in communi_ and _in particulari_. 
第776章 _在交流中_尤其是_的影响。
The semi-Pelagians err in saying of _in communi_ what is true only _in particulari_; and the Calvinists in saying _in particulari_ what is true _in communi_. 
半伯拉纠派的错误在于，他们在谈论“共同的”时，只说“特别的”才是真实的。加尔文主义者则特别指出了“共融”中的真实情况。
(Such is my opinion.)   777  _Omnis Judæa regio, et Jerosolomymi universi, et baptizabantur._[305] Because of all the conditions of men who came there. 
 （这是我的观点。） 777 _Omnis Judæa regio，耶路撒冷的一所大学，一座洗礼堂。_[305] 因为来到那里的人的所有条件。
From these stones there _can_ come children unto Abraham.[306]   778  If men knew themselves, God would heal and pardon them. 
从这些石头中，可以为亚伯拉罕生下孩子。[306] 778 如果人认识自己，上帝就会医治并赦免他们。
_Ne convertantur et sanem eos, et dimittantur eis peccata._[307]   779  Jesus Christ never condemned without hearing. 
 _Ne convertantur et sanem eos, et dimittantur eis peccata._[307] 779 耶稣基督从未在没有听到的情况下被定罪。
To Judas: _Amice, ad quid venisti?_[308] To him that had not on the wedding garment, the same. 
对犹大：_Amice，ad quid venisti？_[308] 对于没有穿结婚礼服的人，同样。
  780  The types of the completeness of the Redemption, as that the sun gives light to all, indicate only completeness; but [_the types_] of exclusions, as of the Jews elected to the exclusion of the Gentiles, indicate exclusion. 
 780 救赎的完整性的预表，就像太阳将光照亮一切一样，只表明了救赎的完整性；但排除的[_the types_]，如犹太人被选举为排除外邦人，表明排除。
" ""Jesus Christ the Redeemer of all.""--Yes, for He has offered, like a man who has ransomed all those who were willing to come to Him. "
 “耶稣基督是所有人的救赎主。”——是的，因为他已经奉献了，就像一个人救赎了所有愿意来到他面前的人。
If any die on the way, it is their misfortune; but, so far as He was concerned, He offered them redemption.--That holds good in this example, where he who ransoms and he who prevents death are two persons, but not of Jesus Christ, who does both these things.--No, for Jesus Christ, in the quality of Redeemer, is not perhaps Master of all; and thus, in so far as it is in Him, He is the Redeemer of all. 
如果有人死在路上，那是他们的不幸；但是，就他而言，他为他们提供了救赎。--在这个例子中，赎罪者和防止死亡的人是两个人，但不是耶稣基督，他做这两件事。--不，因为耶稣基督，以救赎主的身份，也许不是万有之主；他是一切的主宰。因此，就他而言，他是所有人的救赎主。
 When it is said that Jesus Christ did not die for all, you take undue advantage of a fault in men who at once apply this exception to themselves; and this is to favour despair, instead of turning them from it to favour hope. 
当有人说耶稣基督没有为所有人而死时，你就过分地利用了人们的过失，他们立即将这种例外应用到自己身上。这是助长绝望，而不是让他们摆脱绝望而支持希望。
For men thus accustom themselves in inward virtues by outward customs. 
因为人们因此通过外在的习惯来习惯内在的美德。
  781  The victory over death. 
 781 战胜死亡。
"What is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?[309] Whosoever will save his soul, shall lose it.[310]  ""I am not come to destroy the law, but to fulfil.""[311]  ""Lambs took not away the sins of the world, but I am the lamb which taketh away the sins.""[312]  ""Moses[313] hath not led you out of captivity, and made you truly free.""   782  ... "
如果一个人赢得了整个世界而失去了自己的灵魂，那么他有什么好处呢？ [309] 凡是要拯救自己灵魂的人，都会失去它。 [310] “我来不是要废除律法，而是要成全。”[311]“羔羊没有除去世人的罪孽，但我是除去罪孽的羔羊。”[312]“摩西[313]已没有把你带出囚禁，让你真正获得自由。”第782章
Then Jesus Christ comes to tell men that they have no other enemies but themselves; that it is their passions which keep them apart from God; that He comes to destroy these, and give them His grace, so as to make of them all one Holy Church; that He comes to bring back into this Church the heathen and Jews; that He comes to destroy the idols of the former and the superstition of the latter. 
然后耶稣基督来告诉人们，除了自己，他们没有其他敌人；正是他们的情欲使他们远离了上帝；他来毁灭这些，并赐予他们恩典，使他们成为一个神圣的教会；他来是要把异教徒和犹太人带回这个教会；他来是为了摧毁前者的偶像和后者的迷信。
To this all men are opposed, not only from the natural opposition of lust; but, above all, the kings of the earth, as had been foretold, join together to destroy this religion at its birth. 
所有人都反对这一点，不仅出于欲望的自然反对，而且出于本能的反对。但最重要的是，正如所预言的那样，地球上的君王在这个宗教诞生之际联合起来摧毁了它。
(_Proph.: Quare fremuerunt gentes ... 
（_预言：Quare fremuerunt gentes ...
reges terræ ... 
雷格斯地形...
adversus Christum._)[314]  All that is great on earth is united together; the learned, the wise, the kings. 
 adversus Christum._)[314] 地球上所有伟大的事物都团结在一起；有学问的人、智者、国王。
The first write; the second condemn; the last kill. 
第一个写；第二次谴责；最后的杀戮。
And notwithstanding all these oppositions, these men, simple and weak, resist all these powers, subdue even these kings, these learned men and these sages, and remove idolatry from all the earth. 
尽管有所有这些反对，这些简单而软弱的人抵抗了所有这些力量，甚至征服了这些国王、这些学者和这些圣人，并从全世界消除了偶像崇拜。
And all this is done by the power which had foretold it. 
而这一切都是由预言的力量完成的。
  783  Jesus Christ would not have the testimony of devils, nor of those who were not called, but of God and John the Baptist. 
 783 耶稣基督不愿意有魔鬼的见证，也没有那些未蒙召的人的见证，只有上帝和施洗约翰的见证。
  784  I consider Jesus Christ in all persons and in ourselves: Jesus Christ as a Father in His Father, Jesus Christ as a Brother in His Brethren, Jesus Christ as poor in the poor, Jesus Christ as rich in the rich, Jesus Christ as Doctor and Priest in priests, Jesus Christ as Sovereign in princes, etc. 
 784 我认为耶稣基督在所有人和我们自己身上：耶稣基督是他父亲中的父亲，耶稣基督是他弟兄中的兄弟，耶稣基督是穷人中的穷人，耶稣基督是富人中的富人，耶稣基督是医生祭司中的祭司，王子中的耶稣基督作为君王，等等。
For by His glory He is all that is great, being God; and by His mortal life He is all that is poor and abject. 
因为通过他的荣耀，他是一切伟大的，他是神；就他必死的生命而言，他就是一切贫穷和卑微的人。
Therefore He has taken this unhappy condition, so that He could be in all persons, and the model of all conditions. 
因此，他采取了这种不幸的状况，以便他能够存在于所有人之中，并成为所有状况的典范。
  785  Jesus Christ is an obscurity (according to what the world calls obscurity), such that historians, writing only of important matters of states, have hardly noticed Him. 
 785 耶稣基督是一个默默无闻的人（按照世人所说的默默无闻），以至于历史学家只写国家的重要事务，几乎没有注意到他。
  786  _On the fact that neither Josephus, nor Tacitus, nor other historians have spoken of Jesus Christ._--So far is this from telling against Christianity, that on the contrary it tells for it. 
 786_事实上，约瑟夫斯、塔西佗和其他历史学家都没有谈到耶稣基督。_——这绝不是反对基督教，相反，它是支持基督教的。
For it is certain that Jesus Christ has existed; that His religion has made a great talk; and that these persons were not ignorant of it. 
因为耶稣基督确实存在过；他的宗教引起了人们的广泛关注；这些人并非不知道这一点。
Thus it is plain that they purposely concealed it, or that, if they did speak of it, their account has been suppressed or changed. 
因此，很明显，他们是故意隐瞒的，或者，即使他们确实说了，他们的叙述也已被压制或改变。
"  787  ""I have reserved me seven thousand.""[315] I love the worshippers unknown to the world and to the very prophets. "
787 “我为自己保留了七千人。”[315] 我爱那些不为世人所知的崇拜者和先知。
  788  As Jesus Christ remained unknown among men, so His truth remains among common opinions without external difference. 
 788 正如耶稣基督在人们中仍然不为人知，他的真理也同样存在于普遍的观点中，没有外在的差异。
Thus the Eucharist among ordinary bread. 
因此，圣体圣事是在普通面包中。
  789  Jesus would not be slain without the forms of justice; for it is far more ignominious to die by justice than by an unjust sedition. 
 789 耶稣不会在没有正义形式的情况下被杀害；因为死于正义比死于不公正的煽动更为可耻。
  790  The false justice of Pilate only serves to make Jesus Christ suffer; for he causes Him to be scourged by his false justice, and afterwards puts Him to death. 
 790 彼拉多的虚假正义只会让耶稣基督受苦；因为他的虚假正义使他受到鞭打，然后又把他处死。
It would have been better to have put Him to death at once. 
最好立即处死他。
Thus it is with the falsely just. 
虚假正义的人也是如此。
They do good and evil works to please the world, and to show that they are not altogether of Jesus Christ; for they are ashamed of Him. 
他们行善或作恶是为了取悦世人，并表明他们不完全属于耶稣基督。因为他们以他为耻。
And at last, under great temptation and on great occasions, they kill Him. 
最后，在巨大的诱惑下，在重大的场合，他们杀了他。
  791  What man ever had more renown? The whole Jewish people foretell Him before His coming. 
第791章全体犹太人在他来临之前就预言了他。
The Gentile people worship Him after His coming. 
他来后，外邦人敬拜他。
The two peoples, Gentile and Jewish, regard Him as their centre. 
外邦人和犹太人这两个民族都将他视为他们的中心。
 And yet what man enjoys this renown less? Of thirty-three years, He lives thirty without appearing. 
然而，还有哪个人不那么享有这样的声誉呢？三十三岁，三十而未现。
For three years He passes as an impostor; the priests and the chief people reject Him; His friends and His nearest relatives despise Him. 
三年来，他被冒充为冒名顶替者；祭司和首领都拒绝他；他的朋友和他最亲近的亲戚都鄙视他。
Finally, He dies, betrayed by one of His own disciples, denied by another, and abandoned by all. 
最后，他死了，被自己的一个门徒出卖，被另一个门徒否认，并被所有人抛弃。
 What part, then, has He in this renown? Never had man so much renown; never had man more ignominy. 
那么，他在这个名声中扮演了什么角色呢？人类从来没有如此享有盛名；从来没有人比这更耻辱过。
All that renown has served only for us, to render us capable of recognising Him; and He had none of it for Himself. 
所有的名声都只是为我们服务，使我们能够认出他；而他自己却没有这些。
  792  The infinite distance between body and mind is a symbol of the infinitely more infinite distance between mind and charity; for charity is supernatural. 
 792 身与心之间的无限距离，象征着心与布施之间无限更无限的距离；因为慈善是超自然的。
 All the glory of greatness has no lustre for people who are in search of understanding. 
对于寻求理解的人来说，所有伟大的荣耀都没有光泽。
 The greatness of clever men is invisible to kings, to the rich, to chiefs, and to all the worldly great. 
君王、富人、酋长以及一切世俗伟人都看不见聪明人的伟大。
 The greatness of wisdom, which is nothing if not of God, is invisible to the carnal-minded and to the clever. 
智慧的伟大，如果不是出于上帝，就毫无意义，对于属肉体的人和聪明的人来说是看不见的。
These are three orders differing in kind. 
这是三种性质不同的命令。
 Great geniuses have their power, their glory, their greatness, their victory, their lustre, and have no need of worldly greatness, with which they are not in keeping. 
伟大的天才有他们的力量、他们的荣耀、他们的伟大、他们的胜利、他们的光彩，并且不需要世俗的伟大，因为他们不符合这些。
They are seen, not by the eye, but by the mind; this is sufficient. 
它们不是通过眼睛而是通过心灵看到的；这就足够了。
 The saints have their power, their glory, their victory, their lustre, and need no worldly or intellectual greatness, with which they have no affinity; for these neither add anything to them, nor take away anything from them. 
圣徒有他们的力量、他们的荣耀、他们的胜利、他们的光彩，不需要世俗或智力上的伟大，因为他们与这些没有任何亲和力；因为这些既不会给它们增加任何东西，也不会从它们身上夺走任何东西。
They are seen of God and the angels, and not of the body, nor of the curious mind. 
它们是由上帝和天使看到的，而不是由身体或好奇的心灵看到的。
God is enough for them. 
神对他们来说就足够了。
 Archimedes,[316] apart from his rank, would have the same veneration. 
阿基米德[316]除了他的地位之外，也会受到同样的尊敬。
He fought no battles for the eyes to feast upon; but he has given his discoveries to all men. 
他打仗并不是为了让眼睛大饱眼福；但他把他的发现分享给了所有人。
Oh! how brilliant he was to the mind!  Jesus Christ, without riches, and without any external exhibition of knowledge, is in His own order of holiness. 
哦！他的头脑多么聪明啊！耶稣基督，没有财富，也没有任何外在的知识表现，却有他自己的圣洁。
He did not invent; He did not reign. 
他没有发明；他没有发明。他没有统治。
But He was humble, patient, holy, holy to God, terrible to devils, without any sin. 
但他是谦卑、忍耐、圣洁的，对神来说是圣洁的，对魔鬼来说是可怕的，没有任何罪。
Oh! in what great pomp, and in what wonderful splendour, He is come to the eyes of the heart, which perceive wisdom!  It would have been useless for Archimedes to have acted the prince in his books on geometry, although he was a prince. 
哦！祂以何等盛大、何等奇妙的光辉，来到感知智慧的人心的眼前！阿基米德虽然是一位王子，但在他的几何书中扮演王子也是没有用的。
 It would have been useless for our Lord Jesus Christ to come like a king, in order to shine forth in His kingdom of holiness. 
我们的主耶稣基督如果像君王一样降临，在他圣洁的国度里发光，那是没有用的。
But He came there appropriately in the glory of His own order. 
但他恰如其分地带着自己秩序的荣耀来到了那里。
 It is most absurd to take offence at the lowliness of Jesus Christ, as if His lowliness were in the same order as the greatness which He came to manifest. 
冒犯耶稣基督的卑微是极其荒谬的，仿佛他的卑微与他所要彰显的伟大是同等的。
If we consider this greatness in His life, in His passion, in His obscurity, in His death, in the choice of His disciples, in their desertion, in His secret resurrection, and the rest, we shall see it to be so immense, that we shall have no reason for being offended at a lowliness which is not of that order. 
如果我们思考他的生命、他的受难、他的默默无闻、他的死亡、他的门徒的选择、他们的离弃、他秘密的复活以及其他方面的伟大，我们就会看到它是如此巨大，我们没有理由因为不属于这种程度的卑微而感到冒犯。
 But there are some who can only admire worldly greatness, as though there were no intellectual greatness; and others who only admire intellectual greatness, as though there were not infinitely higher things in wisdom. 
但有些人只能欣赏世俗的伟大，仿佛没有知识的伟大；还有一些人只欣赏智力的伟大，好像智慧中不存在无限更高的东西。
 All bodies, the firmament, the stars, the earth and its kingdoms, are not equal to the lowest mind; for mind knows all these and itself; and these bodies nothing. 
所有的物体、苍穹、星星、地球及其王国，都不等于最低的心灵；因为心知道所有这些和它本身；而这些尸体什么也没有。
 All bodies together, and all minds together, and all their products, are not equal to the least feeling of charity. 
所有的身体、所有的思想、以及它们的所有产物，都不等于最起码的慈善感情。
This is of an order infinitely more exalted. 
这是一个无限崇高的境界。
 From all bodies together, we cannot obtain one little thought; this is impossible, and of another order. 
从所有的物体中，我们无法得到一点思考；这是不可能的，而且是另一回事。
From all bodies and minds, we cannot produce a feeling of true charity; this is impossible, and of another and supernatural order. 
我们无法从所有的身体和心灵中产生真正的慈善之感；这是不可能的，并且属于另一种超自然的秩序。
  793  Why did Jesus Christ not come in a visible manner, instead of obtaining testimony of Himself from preceding prophecies? Why did He cause Himself to be foretold in types?   794  If Jesus Christ had only come to sanctify, all Scripture and all things would tend to that end; and it would be quite easy to convince unbelievers. 
 793 耶稣基督为何不以肉眼可见的方式降临，而是从先前的预言中获得自己的见证？为什么他要用预表来预言自己？ 794 如果耶稣基督来只是为了使人成圣，那么所有圣经和所有事物都会趋向于这个目的；说服不信者是很容易的。
If Jesus Christ had only come to blind, all His conduct would be confused; and we would have no means of convincing unbelievers. 
如果耶稣基督只是瞎了眼，那么他的一切行为都会混乱；我们没有办法说服不信者。
But as He came _in sanctificationem et in scandalum_,[317] as Isaiah says, we cannot convince unbelievers, and they cannot convince us. 
但是，正如以赛亚所说，当他进入圣化和丑闻中时，[317]我们无法说服不信者，他们也无法说服我们。
But by this very fact we convince them; since we say that in His whole conduct there is no convincing proof on one side or the other. 
但正是通过这个事实，我们说服了他们；因为我们说，在他的整个行为中，一方面或另一方面都没有令人信服的证据。
  795  Jesus Christ does not say that He is not of Nazareth, in order to leave the wicked in their blindness; nor that He is not Joseph's son. 
 795 耶稣基督并没有说他不是拿撒勒人，是为了让恶人陷入盲目之中；也不知道他不是约瑟的儿子。
  796  _Proofs of Jesus Christ._--Jesus Christ said great things so simply, that it seems as though He had not thought them great; and yet so clearly that we easily see what He thought of them. 
 796_耶稣基督的证据。_--耶稣基督说伟大的事情是如此简单，以至于他似乎并不认为它们伟大；但又如此清晰，我们很容易看出他对他们的看法。
This clearness, joined to this simplicity, is wonderful. 
这种清晰性与这种简单性相结合，真是太棒了。
  797  The style of the gospel is admirable in so many ways, and among the rest in hurling no invectives against the persecutors and enemies of Jesus Christ. 
 797 福音的风格在很多方面都令人钦佩，其中最重要的是没有对耶稣基督的迫害者和敌人进行谩骂。
For there is no such invective in any of the historians against Judas, Pilate, or any of the Jews. 
因为没有哪个历史学家对犹大、彼拉多或任何犹太人进行过这样的谩骂。
 If this moderation of the writers of the Gospels had been assumed, as well as many other traits of so beautiful a character, and they had only assumed it to attract notice, even if they had not dared to draw attention to it themselves, they would not have failed to secure friends, who would have made such remarks to their advantage. 
如果福音书作者的这种温和，以及如此美丽的人物的许多其他特征，他们只是假设它是为了引起注意，即使他们自己不敢引起人们的注意，他们也会并非没有赢得朋友，他们会发表这样的言论对他们有利。
But as they acted thus without pretence, and from wholly disinterested motives, they did not point it out to any one; and I believe that many such facts have not been noticed till now, which is evidence of the natural disinterestedness with which the thing has been done. 
但由于他们这样做毫无伪装，出于完全无私的动机，所以他们没有向任何人指出这一点；我相信，到目前为止，许多这样的事实还没有被注意到，这证明了这件事的自然公正性。
  798  An artisan who speaks of wealth, a lawyer who speaks of war, of royalty, etc.; but the rich man rightly speaks of wealth, a king speaks indifferently of a great gift he has just made, and God rightly speaks of God. 
第798章 工匠谈财富，律师谈战争、皇室等等；但富人正确地谈论财富，国王漠不关心地谈论他刚刚做出的伟大礼物，而上帝正确地谈论上帝。
  799  Who has taught the evangelists the qualities of a perfectly heroic soul, that they paint it so perfectly in Jesus Christ? Why do they make Him weak in His agony? Do they not know how to paint a resolute death? Yes, for the same Saint Luke paints the death of Saint Stephen as braver than that of Jesus Christ. 
第799章 谁教导了福音传道者完美英雄灵魂的品质，以至于他们在耶稣基督里如此完美地描绘了它？为什么他们使他在痛苦中变得软弱呢？难道他们不知道如何描绘坚决的死亡吗？是的，因为同一个圣路加把圣斯蒂芬的死描绘得比耶稣基督的死更勇敢。
 They make Him therefore capable of fear, before the necessity of dying has come, and then altogether brave. 
因此，它们使他能够在死亡到来之前感到恐惧，然后完全勇敢。
 But when they make Him so troubled, it is when He afflicts Himself; and when men afflict Him, He is altogether strong. 
但当他们使他如此烦恼时，正是他自己受苦的时候。当人苦待他时，他就完全坚强了。
  800  _Proof of Jesus Christ._--The supposition that the apostles were impostors is very absurd. 
 800_耶稣基督的证据。_--使徒是骗子的假设是非常荒谬的。
Let us think it out. 
让我们想一想。
Let us imagine those twelve men, assembled after the death of Jesus Christ, plotting to say that He was risen. 
让我们想象一下，耶稣基督死后，那十二个人聚集在一起，密谋说他复活了。
By this they attack all the powers. 
他们以此攻击所有的势力。
The heart of man is strangely inclined to fickleness, to change, to promises, to gain. 
人的心奇怪地倾向于善变、改变、许诺、获取利益。
However little any of them might have been led astray by all these attractions, nay more, by the fear of prisons, tortures, and death, they were lost. 
无论他们中的任何一个人多么可能被所有这些吸引力引入歧途，更重要的是，因为对监狱、酷刑和死亡的恐惧，他们迷失了方向。
Let us follow up this thought. 
让我们跟进这个想法。
  801  The apostles were either deceived or deceivers. 
 801 使徒要么被欺骗，要么被欺骗。
Either supposition has difficulties; for it is not possible to mistake a man raised from the dead ... 
这两种假设都有困难；因为不可能误会一个从死里复活的人......
 While Jesus Christ was with them, He could sustain them. 
当耶稣基督与他们同在时，他就能支持他们。
But, after that, if He did not appear to them, who inspired them to act?     SECTION XIII  THE MIRACLES   802  _The beginning._--Miracles enable us to judge of doctrine, and doctrine enables us to judge of miracles. 
但之后，如果他没有向他们显现，谁启发他们采取行动呢？第十三节 奇迹 802 _开始._--奇迹使我们能够判断教义，教义使我们能够判断奇迹。
 There are false miracles and true. 
奇迹有假的，也有真实的。
There must be a distinction, in order to know them; otherwise they would be useless. 
必须有区别才能认识它们；否则它们就没用了。
Now they are not useless; on the contrary, they are fundamental. 
现在它们并非毫无用处；相反，它们是根本性的。
Now the rule which is given to us must be such, that it does not destroy the proof which the true miracles give of the truth, which is the chief end of the miracles. 
现在给予我们的规则必须是这样的，即它不会破坏真正的奇迹所提供的真理的证据，这是奇迹的主要目的。
 Moses has given two rules: that the prediction does not come to pass (Deut. 
摩西给出了两条规则：预言不会实现（申命记 2：1）。
xviii), and that they do not lead to idolatry (Deut. 
 xviii），并且它们不会导致偶像崇拜（申命记
xiii); and Jesus Christ[318] one. 
十三）；和耶稣基督[318]之一。
 If doctrine regulates miracles, miracles are useless for doctrine. 
如果教义规范奇迹，那么奇迹对于教义来说毫无用处。
 If miracles regulate.... 
如果奇迹能调节……
 _Objection to the rule._--The distinction of the times. 
 _对规则的反对。_--时代的区别。
One rule during the time of Moses, another at present. 
摩西时代有一种规则，现在有另一种规则。
  803  _Miracle._--It is an effect, which exceeds the natural power of the means which are employed for it; and what is not a miracle is an effect, which does not exceed the natural power of the means which are employed for it. 
第803章_奇迹._--这是一种效果，超出了所采用手段的自然力量；凡是不超出所用手段的自然力量的效果就不是奇迹。
Thus, those who heal by invocation of the devil do not work a miracle; for that does not exceed the natural power of the devil. 
因此，那些通过召唤魔鬼来治愈的人并没有创造奇迹，而是创造了奇迹。因为这并没有超出魔鬼的自然力量。
But ... 
但 ...
  804  The two fundamentals; one inward, the other outward; grace and miracles; both supernatural. 
第804章 两个基本原则；一个向内，一个向外；恩典和奇迹；两者都是超自然的。
  805  Miracles and truth are necessary, because it is necessary to convince the entire man, in body and soul. 
 805 奇迹和真理是必要的，因为有必要使整个人的身体和灵魂都信服。
  806  In all times, either men have spoken of the true God, or the true God has spoken to men. 
 806 古往今来，要么是人谈论真神，要么是真神对人说话。
  807  Jesus Christ has verified that He was the Messiah, never in verifying His doctrine by Scripture and the prophecies, but always by His miracles. 
 807 耶稣基督已经证实他是弥赛亚，从来不是通过圣经和预言来证实他的教义，而是总是通过他的奇迹。
 He proves by a miracle that He remits sins. 
他用奇迹证明他赦免了罪孽。
 Rejoice not in your miracles, said Jesus Christ, but because your names are written in heaven.[319]  If they believe not Moses, neither will they believe one risen from the dead. 
耶稣基督说，不要因你的奇迹而喜乐，而是因为你的名字写在天上。 [319]如果他们不相信摩西，他们也不会相信从死里复活的一位。
 Nicodemus recognises by His miracles that His teaching is of God. 
尼哥底母通过他所行的神迹认识到他的教训是出于上帝。
_Scimus quia venisti a Deo magister; nemo enim potest hæc signa facere quæ tu facis nisi Deus fuerit cum eo._[320] He does not judge of the miracles by the teaching, but of the teaching by the miracles. 
 _Scimus quia venisti 一位 Deo 魔导师； nemo enim potest hæc signalafacere quæ tu facis nisi Deus fuerit cum eo._[320] 他不以教导来判断奇迹，而是以奇迹来判断教导。
 The Jews had a doctrine of God as we have one of Jesus Christ, and confirmed by miracles. 
犹太人有关于上帝的教义，就像我们有关于耶稣基督的教义一样，并通过奇迹得到证实。
They were forbidden to believe every worker of miracles; and they were further commanded to have recourse to the chief priests, and to rely on them. 
他们被禁止相信每一个创造奇迹的人；他们还被命令向祭司长求助并依赖他们。
 And thus, in regard to their prophets, they had all those reasons which we have for refusing to believe the workers of miracles. 
因此，关于他们的先知，他们有我们拒绝相信奇迹创造者的所有理由。
 And yet they were very sinful in rejecting the prophets, and Jesus Christ, because of their miracles; and they would not have been culpable, if they had not seen the miracles. 
然而，他们因为先知和耶稣基督所行的神迹而拒绝他们，这是非常有罪的。如果他们没有看到奇迹，他们就不会受到谴责。
_Nisi fecissem ... 
 _Nisi fecissem ...
peccatum non haberent._[321] Therefore all belief rests upon miracles. 
 peccatum non haberent._[321] 因此，所有信仰都依赖于奇迹。
 Prophecy is not called miracle; as Saint John speaks of the first miracle in Cana, and then of what Jesus Christ says to the woman of Samaria, when He reveals to her all her hidden life. 
预言不叫奇迹；预言不叫奇迹。正如圣约翰谈到迦拿的第一个奇迹，然后谈到耶稣基督对撒玛利亚妇女所说的话，当时他向她揭示了她所有隐藏的生活。
"Then He heals the centurion's son; and Saint John calls this ""the second miracle.""[322]   808  The combinations of miracles. "
然后他医治了百夫长的儿子；圣约翰称之为“第二个奇迹”。[322] 808 奇迹的组合。
  809  The second miracle can suppose the first, but the first cannot suppose the second. 
809 第二个奇迹可以假设第一个奇迹，但第一个奇迹不能假设第二个。
  810  Had it not been for the miracles, there would have been no sin in not believing in Jesus Christ. 
 810 如果没有神迹，不相信耶稣基督就没有罪了。
  811  I should not be a Christian, but for the miracles, said Saint Augustine. 
 811 圣奥古斯丁说，如果不是为了奇迹，我就不应该成为基督徒。
  812  _Miracles._--How I hate those who make men doubt of miracles! Montaigne[323] speaks of them as he should in two places. 
第812章_奇迹._--我多么讨厌那些让人们怀疑奇迹的人！蒙田[323]在两个地方谈到了它们。
In one, we see how careful he is; and yet, in the other, he believes, and makes sport of unbelievers. 
一方面，我们看到他是多么小心；另一方面，我们看到他是多么小心谨慎。然而，他相信另一方面，并嘲笑不信者。
 However it may be, the Church is without proofs if they are right. 
不管怎样，教会没有证据证明他们的观点是否正确。
  813  Montaigne against miracles. 
 813 蒙田反对奇迹。
 Montaigne for miracles. 
蒙田创造奇迹。
  814  It is not possible to have a reasonable belief against miracles. 
 814 不可能对奇迹有合理的信念。
  815  Unbelievers the most credulous. 
第815章 异教徒最轻信。
They believe the miracles of Vespasian, in order not to believe those of Moses. 
他们相信维斯帕先的奇迹，而不是相信摩西的奇迹。
  816  _Title: How it happens that men believe so many liars, who say that they have seen miracles, and do not believe any of those who say that they have secrets to make men immortal, or restore youth to them._--Having considered how it happens that so great credence is given to so many impostors, who say they have remedies, often to the length of men putting their lives into their hands, it has appeared to me that the true cause is that there are true remedies. 
第816章为何如此多的冒名顶替者会得到如此大的信任，他们声称自己有补救措施，往往甚至有人将自己的生命交到他们手中，在我看来，真正的原因是存在真正的补救措施。
For it would not be possible that there should be so many false remedies, and that so much faith should be placed in them, if there were none true. 
因为如果没有真实的疗法，就不可能有这么多虚假的疗法，也不可能对它们抱有如此多的信心。
If there had never been any remedy for any ill, and all ills had been incurable, it is impossible that men should have imagined that they could give remedies, and still more impossible that so many others should have believed those who boasted of having remedies; in the same way as did a man boast of preventing death, no one would believe him, because there is no example of this. 
如果任何疾病都没有任何治疗方法，而且所有的疾病都是无法治愈的，那么人们就不可能想象他们可以提供治疗方法，更不可能有那么多人相信那些吹嘘有治疗方法的人；就像一个人吹嘘自己可以避免死亡一样，没有人会相信他，因为没有这样的例子。
But as there were a number of remedies found to be true by the very knowledge of the greatest men, the belief of men is thereby induced; and, this being known to be possible, it has been therefore concluded that it was. 
但是，由于最伟大的人的知识证明了许多治疗方法是真实的，因此人们的信仰就被诱导出来了。众所周知这是可能的，因此得出结论：这是可能的。
"For people commonly reason thus: ""A thing is possible, therefore it is""; because the thing cannot be denied generally, since there are particular effects which are true, the people, who cannot distinguish which among these particular effects are true, believe them all. "
人们通常这样推理：“一件事是可能的，因此它是”；因为事物不能被普遍否认，因为有一些特定的效果是真实的，所以人们无法区分这些特定效果中哪些是真实的，所以他们都相信它们。
In the same way, the reason why so many false effects are credited to the moon, is that there are some true, as the tide. 
同样，之所以有这么多虚假的影响归功于月亮，是因为有一些真实的影响，比如潮汐。
 It is the same with prophecies, miracles, divination by dreams, sorceries, etc. 
预言、奇迹、梦占卜、巫术等也是如此。
For if there had been nothing true in all this, men would have believed nothing of them; and thus, instead of concluding that there are no true miracles because there are so many false, we must, on the contrary, say that there certainly are true miracles, since there are false, and that there are false miracles only because some are true. 
因为如果这一切都不是真的，人们就不会相信它们。因此，我们不能因为有这么多虚假的奇迹而得出不存在真正的奇迹的结论，相反，我们必须说，肯定有真正的奇迹，因为有虚假的奇迹，而有虚假的奇迹只是因为有些是真实的。 。
We must reason in the same way about religion; for it would not be possible that men should have imagined so many false religions, if there had not been a true one. 
我们必须以同样的方式来推理宗教。因为如果没有真正的宗教，人们就不可能想象出这么多错误的宗教。
The objection to this is that savages have a religion; but the answer is that they have heard the true spoken of, as appears by the deluge, circumcision, the cross of Saint Andrew, etc. 
对此的反对意见是，野蛮人有宗教信仰。但答案是他们听到了真正的说法，如洪水、割礼、圣安德鲁的十字架等。
  817  Having considered how it comes that there are so many false miracles, false revelations, sorceries, etc., it has seemed to me that the true cause is that there are some true; for it would not be possible that there should be so many false miracles, if there were none true, nor so many false revelations, if there were none true, nor so many false religions, if there were not one true. 
817考虑到为什么会有这么多虚假的奇迹、虚假的启示、巫术等等，在我看来，真正的原因是存在一些真实的；因为，如果没有真实的东西，就不可能有这么多虚假的奇迹；如果没有真实的东西，就不可能有这么多虚假的启示；如果没有一种真实的宗教，就不可能有这么多虚假的宗教。
For if there had never been all this, it is almost impossible that men should have imagined it, and still more impossible that so many others should have believed it. 
因为如果这一切从未发生过，人们几乎不可能想象到它，更不可能让这么多人相信它。
But as there have been very great things true, and as they have been believed by great men, this impression has been the cause that nearly everybody is rendered capable of believing also the false. 
但是，由于有非常伟大的事情是真实的，而且它们已被伟人所相信，因此这种印象导致几乎每个人都能够相信虚假的事情。
And thus, instead of concluding that there are no true miracles, since there are so many false, it must be said, on the contrary, that there are true miracles, since there are so many false; and that there are false ones only because there are true; and that in the same way there are false religions because there is one true.--Objection to this: savages have a religion. 
因此，与其得出这样的结论：不存在真正的奇迹，因为存在如此多的虚假奇迹，相反，我们必须说存在真正的奇迹，因为存在如此多的虚假奇迹；之所以有假，只是因为有真；同样地，也有虚假的宗教，因为只有一种真实的宗教。——反对这一点：野蛮人有一种宗教。
But this is because they have heard the true spoken of, as appears by the cross of Saint Andrew, the deluge, circumcision, etc.--This arises from the fact that the human mind, finding itself inclined to that side by the truth, becomes thereby susceptible of all the falsehoods of this ... 
但这是因为他们听到了真正的说法，正如圣安德鲁的十字架、洪水、割礼等所表明的那样——这是因为人类的思想发现自己倾向于真理的那一边，因此变得容易受到这一切谎言的影响......
  818  Jeremiah xxiii, 32. 
 818 耶利米二十三世，32。
The _miracles_ of the false prophets. 
假先知的_奇迹_。
In the Hebrew and Vatable[324] they are the _tricks_. 
在希伯来语和 Vatable[324] 中，它们是_技巧_。
 _Miracle_ does not always signify miracle. 
 _Miracle_并不总是意味着奇迹。
I Sam. 
是。
xiv, 15; _miracle_ signifies _fear_, and is so in the Hebrew. 
十四、15； _miracle_ 表示_恐惧_，在希伯来语中也是如此。
The same evidently in Job xxxiii, 7; and also Isaiah xxi, 4; Jeremiah xliv, 12. 
约伯记 xxxiii, 7 中也明显有同样的情况；还有《以赛亚书》二十一章，4；耶利米四世，12。
_Portentum_ signifies _simulacrum_, Jeremiah l, 38; and it is so in the Hebrew and Vatable. 
 _Portentum_ 表示_拟像_，耶利米 l，38；希伯来语和瓦塔布尔语也是如此。
Isaiah viii, 18. 
以赛亚书八章，18。
Jesus Christ says that He and His will be in _miracles_. 
耶稣基督说他和他的旨意都在_奇迹_之中。
  819  If the devil favoured the doctrine which destroys him, he would be divided against himself, as Jesus Christ said. 
 819 如果魔鬼喜欢毁灭他的教义，他就会自相分裂，正如耶稣基督所说。
If God favoured the doctrine which destroys the Church, He would be divided against Himself. 
如果神赞成毁灭教会的教义，他就会分裂自相矛盾。
_Omne regnum divisum._[325] For Jesus Christ wrought against the devil, and destroyed his power over the heart, of which exorcism is the symbolisation, in order to establish the kingdom of God. 
 _Omne regnum divisum._[325] 因为耶稣基督对抗魔鬼，摧毁了他对人心的力量，驱魔就是象征，为了建立神的国度。
And thus He adds, _Si in digito Dei ... 
因此他补充道，_Si in digitalo Dei ...
regnum Dei ad vos_.[326]   820  There is a great difference between tempting and leading into error. 
 regnum Dei ad vos_.[326] 820 诱惑和导致错误之间有很大区别。
God tempts, but He does not lead into error. 
神会试探，但他不会导致错误。
To tempt is to afford opportunities, which impose no necessity; if men do not love God, they will do a certain thing. 
诱惑就是提供机会，而不是强加必要性；如果人不爱神，他们就会做某件事。
To lead into error is to place a man under the necessity of inferring and following out what is untrue. 
导致错误就是使人必须推断和追随不真实的事物。
  821  Abraham and Gideon are above revelation. 
 821 亚伯拉罕和基甸高于启示。
The Jews blinded themselves in judging of miracles by the Scripture. 
犹太人用圣经来判断神迹是盲目的。
God has never abandoned His true worshippers. 
神从来没有放弃真正崇拜他的人。
 I prefer to follow Jesus Christ than any other, because He has miracle, prophecy, doctrine, perpetuity, etc. 
我比任何人都更喜欢跟随耶稣基督，因为他有奇迹、预言、教义、永恒等等。
 The Donatists. 
多纳徒派。
No miracle which obliges them to say it is the devil. 
没有奇迹迫使他们说这是魔鬼。
 The more we particularise God, Jesus Christ, the Church ... 
我们越是特别强调神、耶稣基督、教会……
  822  If there were no false miracles, there would be certainty. 
 822 如果没有虚假的奇迹，那就有确定性了。
If there were no rule to judge of them, miracles would be useless, and there would be no reason for believing. 
如果没有规则来评判，奇迹就毫无用处，也就没有理由相信。
 Now there is, humanly speaking, no human certainty, but we have reason. 
现在，从人的角度来说，没有人的确定性，但我们有理由。
  823  Either God has confounded the false miracles, or He has foretold them; and in both ways He has raised Himself above what is supernatural with respect to us, and has raised us to it. 
823 要么上帝混淆了虚假的奇迹，要么他已经预言了它们；他以这两种方式使自己超越了对我们而言的超自然事物，并把我们提升到了超自然事物之上。
  824  Miracles serve not to convert, but to condemn. 
 824 奇迹不是用来改变信仰，而是用来谴责。

以赛亚看到他的荣耀并谈到他时这样说：犹太人寻求神迹，希腊人寻求智慧，但我们耶稣被钉在十字架上。
Sed plenum signis, sed plenum sapientia; vos autem Christum non crucifixum et religionem sine miraculis et sine sapientia._[328]  What makes us not believe in the true miracles, is want of love. 
却充满征兆，又充满智慧；但基督没有被钉在十字架上，宗教没有奇迹和智慧。_[328] 是什么让我们不相信真正的奇迹，是缺乏爱。
John: _Sed vos non creditis, quia non estis ex ovibus._[329] What makes us believe the false is want of love. 
约翰：_但你不相信，因为你不是羊。_ [329] 使我们相信虚假的是缺乏爱。

 The foundation of religion. 
宗教的基础。
It is the miracles. 
这就是奇迹。
What then? Does God speak against miracles, against the foundations of the faith which we have in Him?  If there is a God, faith in God must exist on earth. 
然后怎样呢？神是否反对神迹、反对我们对他的信仰基础？如果有上帝，地球上就必须存在对上帝的信仰。
Now the miracles of Jesus Christ are not foretold by Antichrist, but the miracles of Antichrist are foretold by Jesus Christ. 
耶稣基督所行的神迹不是敌基督所预言的，而是敌基督所行的神迹是耶稣基督所预言的。
And so if Jesus Christ were not the Messiah, He would have indeed led into error. 
因此，如果耶稣基督不是弥赛亚，他确实会导致错误。
When Jesus Christ foretold the miracles of Antichrist, did He think of destroying faith in His own miracles?  Moses foretold Jesus Christ, and bade to follow Him. 
当耶稣基督预言敌基督的奇迹时，他是否想到要摧毁人们对自己奇迹的信心？摩西预言了耶稣基督，并嘱咐要跟随他。
Jesus Christ foretold Antichrist, and forbade to follow him. 
耶稣基督预言了敌基督，并禁止跟随他。
 It was impossible that in the time of Moses men should keep their faith for Antichrist, who was unknown to them. 
在摩西时代，人们不可能对他们不认识的敌基督保持信仰。
But it is quite easy, in the time of Antichrist, to believe in Jesus Christ, already known. 
但在敌基督的时代，相信已知的耶稣基督是很容易的。
 There is no reason for believing in Antichrist, which there is not for believing in Jesus Christ. 
没有理由相信敌基督，也没有理由相信耶稣基督。
But there are reasons for believing in Jesus Christ, which there are not for believing in the other. 
但相信耶稣基督是有理由的，而相信另一个却没有理由。

 828 耶稣基督说圣经为他作见证。
But He does not point out in what respect. 
但他没有指出具体是哪方面。
 Even the prophecies could not prove Jesus Christ during His life; and so, men would not have been culpable for not believing in Him before His death, had the miracles not sufficed without doctrine. 
即使是预言也无法证明耶稣基督在世；因此，如果没有教义，神迹还不够，人们就不会因为在他死前不相信他而受到责备。
Now those who did not believe in Him, when He was still alive, were sinners, as He said Himself, and without excuse. 
当他还活着的时候，那些不相信他的人都是罪人，正如他自己所说，而且没有任何借口。
Therefore they must have had proof beyond doubt, which they resisted. 
因此，他们一定有毫无疑问的证据，但他们却拒绝了。
Now, they had not the prophecies, but only the miracles. 
现在，他们没有预言，只有神迹。
Therefore the latter suffice, when the doctrine is not inconsistent with them; and they ought to be believed. 
因此，当教义与它们不矛盾时，后者就足够了。他们应该被相信。
 John vii, 40. 
约翰七世，40 岁。
_Dispute among the Jews as among the Christians of to-day._ Some believed in Jesus Christ; others believed Him not, because of the prophecies which said that He should be born in Bethlehem. 
_犹太人之间的争论就像今天基督徒之间的争论一样。_有些人相信耶稣基督，有些人相信耶稣基督。其他人不相信他，因为预言说他将出生在伯利恒。
They should have considered more carefully whether He was not. 
他们应该更仔细地考虑他是否不是。
For His miracles being convincing, they should have been quite sure of these supposed contradictions of His teaching to Scripture; and this obscurity did not excuse, but blinded them. 
由于他的神迹令人信服，他们应该非常肯定他的教导与圣经的这些所谓的矛盾。这种默默无闻并没有成为他们的借口，反而蒙蔽了他们。
Thus those who refuse to believe in the miracles in the present day on account of a supposed contradiction, which is unreal, are not excused. 
因此，那些因为不真实的假设矛盾而拒绝相信当今奇迹的人是不可原谅的。
" The Pharisees said to the people, who believed in Him, because of His miracles: ""This people who knoweth not the law are cursed. "
法利赛人因他所行的神迹，对信他的百姓说：“这不明白律法的百姓是被咒诅的。
"But have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? For we know that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet."" Nicodemus answered: ""Doth our law judge any man before it hear him, [and specially, such a man who works such miracles]?""   829  The prophecies were ambiguous; they are no longer so. "
但官长或法利赛人有相信他的吗？因为我们知道加利利没有出过先知。”尼哥底母回答说：“我们的律法在未听从他之前，难道能审判他吗？[特别是，一个创造如此奇迹的人]？”829 这些预言是含糊的；它们不是更久如此。
  830  The five propositions were ambiguous; they are no longer so. 
 830 这五个命题含糊不清；他们不再是这样了。
  831  Miracles are no longer necessary, because we have had them already. 
 831 奇迹不再需要，因为我们已经拥有了。
But when tradition is no longer minded; when the Pope alone is offered to us; when he has been imposed upon; and when the true source of truth, which is tradition, is thus excluded; and the Pope, who is its guardian, is biased; the truth is no longer free to appear. 
但当传统不再受到关注时；当教皇单独提供给我们时；当他被强加时；当真理的真正来源——传统——被排除在外时；而作为其守护者的教皇却有偏见；真相不再随意出现。
Then, as men speak no longer of truth, truth itself must speak to men. 
然后，当人们不再谈论真理时，真理本身必须向人们说话。
This is what happened in the time of Arius.

 It is unfortunate to be in exception to the rule. 
不幸的是，成为规则的例外。
The same must be strict, and opposed to exception. 
同样必须严格，反对例外。
But yet, as it is certain that there are exceptions to a rule, our judgment must though strict, be just. 
然而，由于规则肯定有例外，因此我们的判断必须严格但公正。
  833  John vi, 26: _Non quia vidisti signum, sed quia saturati estis._  Those who follow Jesus Christ because of His miracles honour His power in all the miracles which it produces. 
 833 约翰六世，26：_Non quia vidisti Signum，sed quia saturati estis。_那些因为耶稣基督所行的奇迹而跟随他的人，在他所创造的一切奇迹中尊崇他的力量。
But those who, making profession to follow Him because of His miracles, follow Him in fact only because He comforts them and satisfies them with worldly blessings, discredit His miracles, when they are opposed to their own comforts. 
但那些自称因为他所行的神迹而跟随他的人，事实上只是因为他安慰他们并用世俗的祝福满足他们而跟随他，当他们反对自己的安慰时，他们就怀疑他的神迹。

In the New, when they will turn you from Jesus Christ. 
在新时代，他们会让你远离耶稣基督。
These are the occasions for excluding particular miracles from belief. 
这些都是将特定奇迹排除在信仰之外的场合。
No others need be excluded. 
无需排除其他人。
 Does it therefore follow that they would have the right to exclude all the prophets who came to them? No; they would have sinned in not excluding those who denied God, and would have sinned in excluding those who did not deny God. 
因此，他们是否有权排除所有来到他们这里的先知？不;他们若不排除那些否认神的人，就会犯下罪；若排除那些不否认神的人，他们也会犯罪。
 So soon, then, as we see a miracle, we must either assent to it, or have striking proofs to the contrary. 
那么，很快，当我们看到一个奇迹时，我们必须要么同意它，要么有惊人的证据证明相反的观点。
We must see if it denies a God, or Jesus Christ, or the Church. 
我们必须看看它是否否认上帝、耶稣基督或教会。
  835  There is a great difference between not being for Jesus Christ and saying so, and not being for Jesus Christ and pretending to be so. 
 835 不拥护耶稣基督并这么说与不拥护耶稣基督并假装如此之间有很大的区别。
The one party can do miracles, not the others. 
一方可以创造奇迹，其他一方则不行。
For it is clear of the one party, that they are opposed to the truth, but not of the others; and thus miracles are clearer. 
因为很明显，这一方是反对真理的，但其他方则不然。这样，奇迹就更加清晰了。
  836  That we must love one God only is a thing so evident, that it does not require miracles to prove it. 
 836 我们必须只爱一位上帝，这是一件显而易见的事情，不需要奇迹来证明。
  837  Jesus Christ performed miracles, then the apostles, and the first saints in great number; because the prophecies not being yet accomplished, but in the process of being accomplished by them, the miracles alone bore witness to them. 
 837 耶稣基督创造了奇迹，然后是使徒，以及许多最初的圣徒；因为预言还没有实现，但在它们实现的过程中，只有奇迹才能见证它们。
It was foretold that the Messiah should convert the nations. 
预言弥赛亚将使万国皈依。
How could this prophecy be fulfilled without the conversion of the nations? And how could the nations be converted to the Messiah, if they did not see this final effect of the prophecies which prove Him? Therefore, till He had died, risen again, and converted the nations, all was not accomplished; and so miracles were needed during all this time. 
如果万民不悔改，这个预言怎么可能实现呢？如果万民没有看到证明弥赛亚的预言的最终效果，他们怎么能皈依弥赛亚呢？因此，直到他受死、复活、使万民归正之前，一切都还没有完成。所以这段时间需要奇迹。
Now they are no longer needed against the Jews; for the accomplished prophecies constitute a lasting miracle. 
现在不再需要他们来对付犹太人了；因为预言的实现构成了永恒的奇迹。
"  838  ""Though ye believe not Me, believe at least the works.""[331] He refers them, as it were, to the strongest proof. "
 838“虽然你们不相信我，但至少相信作品。”[331]他可以说是向他们提出了最有力的证据。
 It had been told to the Jews, as well as to Christians, that they should not always believe the prophets; but yet the Pharisees and Scribes are greatly concerned about His miracles, and try to show that they are false, or wrought by the devil. 
犹太人和基督徒都被告知，他们不应该总是相信先知。但法利赛人和文士却非常关心他所行的神迹，并试图证明这些神迹是假的，或者是魔鬼所行的。
For they must needs be convinced, if they acknowledge that they are of God. 
因为如果他们承认自己是出于上帝，就必须被说服。
 At the present day we are not troubled to make this distinction. 
目前我们并不费心去做出这种区分。
Still it is very easy to do: those who deny neither God nor Jesus Christ do no miracles which are not certain. 
但这仍然很容易做到：那些既不否认上帝也不否认耶稣基督的人不会创造不确定的奇迹。
_Nemo facit virtutem in nomine meo, et cito possit de me male loqui._[332]  But we have not to draw this distinction. 
 _Nemo facit virtutem in nomine meo, et cito possit de memale loqui._[332] 但我们不必做出这种区分。
Here is a sacred relic.[333] Here is a thorn from the crown of the Saviour of the world, over whom the prince of this world has no power, which works miracles by the peculiar power of the blood shed for us. 
这是一件神圣的遗物。[333]这是世界救主冠冕上的一根刺，这个世界的王子对他没有任何权力，它通过为我们流血的特殊力量创造了奇迹。
Now God Himself chooses this house in order to display conspiciously therein His power. 
现在，上帝亲自选择这座房子，以便在其中显着地展示他的力量。
 These are not men who do miracles by an unknown and doubtful virtue, which makes a decision difficult for us. 
这些人并不是靠未知和可疑的美德创造奇迹的，这让我们很难做出决定。
It is God Himself. 
这是神自己。
It is the instrument of the Passion of His only Son, who, being in many places, chooses this, and makes men come from all quarters there to receive these miraculous alleviations in their weaknesses. 
它是他独生子受难的工具，他在许多地方选择了这一点，并让人们从四面八方来到那里，接受这些奇迹般的软弱缓解。
  839  The Church has three kinds of enemies: the Jews, who have never been of her body; the heretics, who have withdrawn from it; and the evil Christians, who rend her from within. 
839 教会有三种敌人：犹太人，他们从未属于她的身体；异教徒，他们已经退出了；还有邪恶的基督徒，他们从内部撕裂了她。
 These three kinds of different adversaries usually attack her in different ways. 
这三种不同的对手通常会以不同的方式攻击她。
But here they attack her in one and the same way. 
但在这里，他们以一种同样的方式攻击她。
As they are all without miracles, and as the Church has always had miracles against them, they have all had the same interest in evading them; and they all make use of this excuse, that doctrine must not be judged by miracles, but miracles by doctrine. 
因为他们都没有奇迹，而且教会总是有奇迹来对付他们，所以他们都有同样的兴趣来逃避奇迹；他们都用这样的借口：教义不能用神迹来判断，而是神迹要用教义来判断。
There were two parties among those who heard Jesus Christ: those who followed His teaching on account of His miracles; others who said.... 
听过耶稣基督的人中有两派：一派是因他所行的神迹而跟随他的教导；另一派是因他所行的神迹而遵循他的教导；另一派是因他所行的神迹而跟随他的教导。其他人说....
There were two parties in the time of Calvin.... 
加尔文时代有两个聚会......
There are now the Jesuits, etc. 
现在还有耶稣会士等等。
  840  Miracles furnish the test in matters of doubt, between Jews and heathens, Jews and Christians, Catholics and heretics, the slandered and slanderers, between the two crosses. 
 840 奇迹在犹太人和异教徒之间、犹太人和基督徒之间、天主教徒和异端之间、被诽谤者和诽谤者之间、两个十字架之间提供了对可疑问题的检验。
 But miracles would be useless to heretics; for the Church, authorised by miracles which have already obtained belief, tells us that they have not the true faith. 
但奇迹对于异教徒来说是毫无用处的。因为教会通过已经获得信仰的奇迹来授权，告诉我们他们没有真正的信仰。
There is no doubt that they are not in it, since the first miracles of the Church exclude belief of theirs. 
毫无疑问，他们并不参与其中，因为教会的第一个奇迹排除了他们的信仰。
Thus there is miracle against miracle, both the first and greatest being on the side of the Church. 
因此，奇迹与奇迹之间存在着奇迹，而第一个也是最伟大的存在都站在教会一边。
 These nuns,[334] astonished at what is said, that they are in the way of perdition; that their confessors are leading them to Geneva; that they suggest to them that Jesus Christ is not in the Eucharist, nor on the right hand of the Father; know that all this is false, and therefore offer themselves to God in this state. 
这些修女，[334]对所说的话感到惊讶，她们正走在灭亡之路上；他们的忏悔神父正在带领他们前往日内瓦；他们向他们暗示耶稣基督不在圣体圣事中，也不在天父的右边；知道这一切都是假的，因此以这种状态将自己献给上帝。
_Vide si via iniquitatis in me est._[335] What happens thereupon? This place, which is said to be the temple of the devil, God makes His own temple. 
 _Vide si via iniquitatis in me est._[335] 接下来会发生什么？这个据说是魔鬼圣殿的地方，是上帝为自己打造的圣殿。

Lastly, they are threatened with all the fury and vengeance of heaven; and God overwhelms them with favours. 
最后，他们受到上天所有愤怒和复仇的威胁。上帝赐福给他们。
A man would need to have lost his senses to conclude from this that they are therefore in the way of perdition. 
一个人必须失去理智才能得出这样的结论：他们因此陷入了灭亡。

 _Secundum operationem Satanæ, in seductione iis qui pereunt eo quod charitatem veritatis non receperunt ut salvi fierent, ideo mittet illis Deus optationes erroris ut credant mendacio._  As in the passage of Moses: _Tentat enim vos Deus, utrum diligatis eum.[342]  Ecce prædixi vobis: vos ergo videte._[343]   842  Here is not the country of truth. 
 _根据撒旦的运作，在引诱那些因没有接受真理的仁慈而得救而灭亡的人时，上帝将向他们发送错误的欲望，使他们相信谎言。_如在段落中摩西：_因为神正在考验你，看你是否爱他。[342]看啊，我已经对你们说过了：所以你们看吧。[343]842 这里不是真理的国度。
She wanders unknown amongst men. 
她在男人间默默无闻地徘徊。
God has covered her with a veil, which leaves her unrecognised by those who do not hear her voice. 
上帝给她盖上了一层面纱，让那些听不到她声音的人认不出她来。
Room is opened for blasphemy, even against the truths that are at least very likely. 
亵渎的空间已经打开，即使是反对至少很可能的事实。
If the truths of the Gospel are published, the contrary is published too, and the questions are obscured, so that the people cannot distinguish. 
如果福音的真理被出版，相反的真理也被出版，问题就变得模糊，以致人们无法辨别。
"And they ask, ""What have you to make you believed rather than others? What sign do you give? You have only words, and so have we. "
他们问：“你有什么可以让你比别人更相信？你给出什么征兆？你只有言语，我们也有。
"If you had miracles, good and well."" That doctrine ought to be supported by miracles is a truth, which they misuse in order to revile doctrine. "
如果你有奇迹，那就太好了。”这个教义应该由奇迹来支持，这是一个真理，但他们却滥用这个真理来辱骂教义。
And if miracles happen, it is said that miracles are not enough without doctrine; and this is another truth, which they misuse in order to revile miracles. 
如果奇迹发生了，据说没有教义，奇迹是不够的；这是另一个真理，他们滥用这个真理来辱骂奇迹。
 Jesus Christ cured the man born blind, and performed a number of miracles on the Sabbath day. 
耶稣基督治愈了生来失明的人，并在安息日创造了许多奇迹。
In this way He blinded the Pharisees, who said that miracles must be judged by doctrine. 
他就这样蒙蔽了法利赛人，他们说神迹奇事必须根据教义来判断。
" ""We have Moses: but, as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.""[344] It is wonderful that you know not whence He is, and yet He does such miracles. "
“我们有摩西：但是，至于这个人，我们不知道他从哪里来。”[344]你不知道他从哪里来，但他却创造了这样的奇迹，这真是太棒了。
 Jesus Christ spoke neither against God, nor against Moses. 
耶稣基督既没有反对上帝，也没有反对摩西。
 Antichrist and the false prophets, foretold by both Testaments, will speak openly against God and against Jesus Christ. 
两约都预言，敌基督者和假先知将公开反对上帝和耶稣基督。
Who is not hidden ...

God would not allow him, who would be a secret enemy, to do miracles openly. 
上帝不会允许他这个秘密敌人公开地创造奇迹。
 In a public dispute where the two parties profess to be for God, for Jesus Christ, for the Church, miracles have never been on the side of the false Christians, and the other side has never been without a miracle. 
在一场公开的争论中，两方都声称自己是为了上帝、为了耶稣基督、为了教会，假基督徒一方从来没有出现过奇迹，而另一方也从来没有出现过奇迹。
" ""He hath a devil."" John x, 21. "
 “他有恶魔。”约翰十世，21 岁。
"And others said, ""Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?""  The proofs which Jesus Christ and the apostles draw from Scripture are not conclusive; for they say only that Moses foretold that a prophet should come. "
还有人说：“魔鬼能打开盲人的眼睛吗？”耶稣基督和使徒们从圣经中得出的证据并不是决定性的。因为他们只说摩西预言一位先知将会到来。
But they do not thereby prove that this is He; and that is the whole question. 
但他们并没有因此证明这是他；这就是整个问题。
These passages therefore serve only to show that they are not contrary to Scripture, and that there appears no inconsistency, but not that there is agreement. 
因此，这些段落只是表明它们并不违反圣经，并且没有出现不一致之处，但并不能表明它们是一致的。
Now this is enough, namely, exclusion of inconsistency, along with miracles. 
现在这就足够了，即排除不一致，并创造奇迹。
 There is a mutual duty between God and men. 
神与人之间有相互的责任。
"We must pardon Him this saying: Quid debui?[345] ""Accuse me,"" said God in Isaiah. "

 Men owe it to God to accept the religion which He sends. 
人们有责任接受上帝所赐予的宗教。
God owes it to men not to lead them into error. 
上帝有责任不让人们误入歧途。
Now, they would be led into error, if the workers of miracles announced a doctrine which should not appear evidently false to the light of common sense, and if a greater worker of miracles had not already warned men not to believe them. 
现在，如果奇迹的创造者宣布了一个在常识看来不应该明显错误的学说，如果一个更伟大的奇迹创造者没有警告人们不要相信他们，他们就会犯错误。
 Thus, if there were divisions in the Church, and the Arians, for example, who declared themselves founded on Scripture just as the Catholics, had done miracles, and not the Catholics, men should have been led into error. 
因此，如果教会中存在分歧，例如阿里乌派，他们声称自己像天主教徒一样以圣经为基础，创造了奇迹，而不是天主教徒，那么人们就应该被引入错误。
 For, as a man, who announces to us the secrets of God, is not worthy to be believed on his private authority, and that is why the ungodly doubt him; so when a man, as a token of the communion which he has with God, raises the dead, foretells the future, removes the seas, heals the sick, there is none so wicked as not to bow to him, and the incredulity of Pharaoh and the Pharisees is the effect of a supernatural obduracy. 
因为，作为一个向我们宣布上帝秘密的人，他的私人权威是不值得相信的，这就是不敬虔的人怀疑他的原因；因此，当一个人作为他与上帝相交的象征，使死者复活，预言未来，移走海洋，治愈病人时，没有人比他更邪恶，不向他鞠躬，而法老的怀疑法利赛人是超自然的顽固的结果。
 When, therefore, we see miracles and a doctrine not suspicious, both on one side, there is no difficulty. 
因此，当我们同时看到奇迹和不容怀疑的教义时，就没有困难了。
But when we see miracles and suspicious doctrine on the same side, we must then see which is the clearest. 
但当我们看到奇迹和可疑的教义站在同一边时，我们必须看看哪一个是最清楚的。
Jesus Christ was suspected. 
耶稣基督受到怀疑。
 Bar-jesus blinded.[346] The power of God surpasses that of His enemies. 
巴-耶稣瞎了。[346]神的力量胜过他的敌人。
" The Jewish exorcists[347] beaten by the devils, saying, ""Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?""  Miracles are for doctrine, and not doctrine for miracles. "
犹太驱魔师[347]被魔鬼殴打，说：“我认识耶稣，我认识保罗；但你们是谁？”神迹是为了教义，而不是教义为了神迹。
 If the miracles are true, shall we be able to persuade men of all doctrine? No; for this will not come to pass. 
如果奇迹是真的，我们是否能够说服人们相信所有的教义？不;因为这不会发生。
_Si angelus_.[348] ... 
 _Si Angelus_。[348] ...
 Rule: we must judge of doctrine by miracles; we must judge of miracles by doctrine. 
规则：我们必须用奇迹来判断教义；我们必须根据教义来判断奇迹。
All this is true, but contains no contradiction. 
这一切都是事实，但并不矛盾。
 For we must distinguish the times. 
因为我们必须区分时代。
 How glad you are to know the general rules, thinking thereby to set up dissension, and render all useless! We shall prevent you, my father; truth is one and constant. 
你多么高兴知道一般规则，想借此挑起争端，使一切变得毫无用处！我们会阻止你，我的父亲；真理是单一且不变的。
 It is impossible, from the duty of God to men, that a man, hiding his evil teaching, and only showing the good, saying that he conforms to God and the Church, should do miracles so as to instil insensibly a false and subtle doctrine. 
从上帝对人的责任来看，一个人不可能隐藏他的邪恶教义，只表现善行，说他符合上帝和教会，而创造奇迹，从而在不知不觉中灌输虚假和狡猾的教义。 。
This cannot happen. 
这不可能发生。
 And still less, that God, who knows the heart, should perform miracles in favour of such a one. 
更不用说，了解人心的上帝应该为这样的人创造奇迹。
  843  The three marks of religion: perpetuity, a good life, miracles. 
 843 宗教的三个标志：永恒、美好生活、奇迹。
They destroy perpetuity by their doctrine of probability; a good life by their morals; miracles by destroying either their truth or the conclusions to be drawn from them. 
他们用概率学说摧毁了永恒性；良好的生活靠他们的道德；通过破坏其真理或从中得出的结论来创造奇迹。
 If we believe them, the Church will have nothing to do with perpetuity, holiness, and miracles. 
如果我们相信它们，教会就与永恒、圣洁和奇迹无关。
The heretics deny them, or deny the conclusions to be drawn from them; they do the same. 
异端分子否认它们，或者否认从中得出的结论；他们也这样做。
But one would need to have no sincerity in order to deny them, or again to lose one's senses in order to deny the conclusions to be drawn from them. 
但要否认它们，就不需要有任何诚意，或者再次失去理智，才能否认从中得出的结论。
 Nobody has ever suffered martyrdom for the miracles which he says he has seen; for the folly of men goes perhaps to the length of martyrdom, for those which the Turks believe by tradition, but not for those which they have seen. 
没有人因为他说他亲眼所见的奇迹而遭受过殉难。因为，对于土耳其人传统上相信的人来说，人类的愚蠢也许会达到殉道的程度，但对于他们亲眼所见的人来说，却并非如此。
  844  The heretics have always attacked these three marks, which they have not. 
844 异端一直攻击这三个标记，但他们却没有。
"  845  _First objection_: ""An angel from heaven.[349] We must not judge of truth by miracles, but of miracles by truth. "
 845_第一个反对意见_：“来自天上的天使。[349]我们不能用奇迹来判断真理，而是用真理来判断奇迹。
"Therefore the miracles are useless.""  Now they are of use, and they must not be in opposition to the truth. "
所以神迹是没有用的。”现在神迹有用了，不能与真理相悖。
"Therefore what Father Lingende[350] has said, that ""God will not permit that a miracle may lead into error....""  When there shall be a controversy in the same Church, miracle will decide. "
因此，林根德神父[350]说过，“上帝不会允许奇迹导致错误……”当同一教会出现争议时，奇迹将做出决定。
" _Second objection_: ""But Antichrist will do miracles.""  The magicians of Pharaoh did not entice to error. "
 _第二个反对意见_：“但是敌基督会创造奇迹。”法老的术士们并没有引诱犯错。
"Thus we cannot say to Jesus respecting Antichrist, ""You have led me into error."" For Antichrist will do them against Jesus Christ, and so they cannot lead into error. "
因此，我们不能对敌基督者耶稣说：“你让我陷入了错误。”因为敌基督者会针对耶稣基督做这些事，所以他们不会导致错误。
Either God will not permit false miracles, or He will procure greater. 
要么上帝不允许虚假的奇迹出现，要么他会创造更大的奇迹。
 [Jesus Christ has existed since the beginning of the world: this is more impressive than all the miracles of Antichrist.]  If in the same Church there should happen a miracle on the side of those in error, men would be led into error. 
[耶稣基督自创世以来就存在：这比敌基督者的所有奇迹更令人印象深刻。] 如果在同一个教会中，在那些错误的人一边发生奇迹，人们就会被引入错误。
Schism is visible; a miracle is visible. 
分裂是显而易见的；奇迹是可见的。
But schism is more a sign of error than a miracle is a sign of truth. 
但分裂更多地是错误的标志，而不是奇迹是真理的标志。
Therefore a miracle cannot lead into error. 
因此，奇迹不会导致错误。
 But apart from schism, error is not so obvious as a miracle is obvious. 
但除了分裂之外，错误并不像奇迹那么明显。
Therefore a miracle could lead into error. 
因此，奇迹可能会导致错误。
 _Ubi est Deus tuus?_[351] Miracles show Him, and are a light. 
 _Ubi est Deus tuus？_[351] 奇迹向他展示，并且是一道光。
  846  One of the anthems for Vespers at Christmas: _Exortum est in tenebris lumen rectis corde._[352]   847  If the compassion of God is so great that He instructs us to our benefit, even when He hides Himself, what light ought we not to expect from Him when He reveals Himself?   848  Will _Est et non est_ be received in faith itself as well as in miracles? And if it is inseparable in the others ... 
 846 圣诞节晚祷的颂歌之一：_Exortum est in tenebris lumen ectis corde._[352] 847 如果天主的慈悲如此伟大，以至于即使在他隐藏自己的时候，他仍指导我们对我们有利，那么我们不应该有什么光明呢？当他显现自己时，对他有什么期待？第848章如果它与其他人密不可分......

如果他们说我们的救恩取决于神，他们就是“异端”。如果他们说他们服从教皇，那就是“虚伪”。如果他们准备好订阅所有文章，那还不够。
"If they say that a man must not be killed for an apple, ""they attack the morality of Catholics."" If miracles are done among them, it is not a sign of holiness, and is, on the contrary, a symptom of heresy. "
如果他们说一个人不能为了一个苹果而被杀，“他们就是在攻击天主教徒的道德”。如果他们中间行了神迹，那并不是圣洁的标志，相反，是异端的征兆。
 This way in which the Church has existed is that truth has been without dispute, or, if it has been contested, there has been the Pope, or, failing him, there has been the Church. 
教会以这种方式存在，真理是毫无争议的，或者，如果有争议的话，就存在着教皇，或者，如果教皇失败了，就存在着教会。

 It is impossible that those who love God with all their heart should fail to recognise the Church; so evident is she.--It is impossible that those who do not love God should be convinced of the Church. 
全心爱神的人不可能不承认教会；她是如此明显。——那些不爱上帝的人不可能相信教会。
 Miracles have such influence that it was necessary that God should warn men not to believe in them in opposition to Him, all clear as it is that there is a God. 
神迹具有如此大的影响力，以至于上帝有必要警告人们不要相信与他相反的神迹，尽管上帝的存在是显而易见的。
Without this they would have been able to disturb men.

There would be as much reason in saying that, if the Eucharist raised a dead man, it would be necessary for one to turn a Calvinist rather than remain a Catholic.

 The source of this is the union of the two natures in Jesus Christ; and also the two worlds (the creation of a new heaven and a new earth; a new life and a new death; all things double, and the same names remaining); and finally the two natures that are in the righteous, (for they are the two worlds, and a member and image of Jesus Christ. 
其根源在于耶稣基督的两种本性的结合。还有两个世界（新天新地的创造；新生命和新死亡；万物加倍，并且保留相同的名字）；最后是义人的两种本性（因为它们是两个世界，是耶稣基督的肢体和形象。
And thus all the names suit them: righteous, yet sinners; dead, yet living; living, yet dead; elect, yet outcast, etc.). 
因此，所有的名字都适合他们：义人，却是罪人；死了，却还活着；活着，却又死了；被选中，但被遗弃，等等）。
 There are then a great number of truths, both of faith and of morality, which seem contradictory, and which all hold good together in a wonderful system. 
存在着大量的真理，既有信仰的真理，也有道德的真理，它们看似相互矛盾，但却在一个奇妙的体系中完美地结合在一起。
The source of all heresies is the exclusion of some of these truths; and the source of all the objections which the heretics make against us is the ignorance of some of our truths. 
所有异端的根源都是对其中一些真理的排斥；异教徒对我们提出的所有反对意见的根源在于他们对我们的某些真理的无知。
And it generally happens that, unable to conceive the connection of two opposite truths, and believing that the admission of one involves the exclusion of the other, they adhere to the one, exclude the other, and think of us as opposed to them. 
通常情况下，他们无法想象两个相反真理之间的联系，并且相信承认一个真理就意味着排除另一个真理，因此他们坚持一个真理，排除另一个真理，并认为我们与他们相对立。
Now exclusion is the cause of their heresy; and ignorance that we hold the other truth causes their objections. 
现在，排斥是他们异端的原因；他们不知道我们持有另一种真理，因而提出反对。
 1st example: Jesus Christ is God and man. 
第一个例子：耶稣基督是神也是人。
The Arians, unable to reconcile these things, which they believe incompatible, say that He is man; in this they are Catholics. 
阿里乌派无法调和这些事情，他们认为这些事情是不相容的，所以说他是人。在这一点上，他们是天主教徒。
But they deny that He is God; in this they are heretics. 
但他们否认他是神；在这一点上他们是异端。
They allege that we deny His humanity; in this they are ignorant. 
他们声称我们否认他的人性；在这一点上他们是无知的。
 2nd example: On the subject of the Holy Sacrament. 
第二个例子：关于圣礼的主题。
We believe that, the substance of the bread being changed, and being consubstantial with that of the body of our Lord, Jesus Christ is therein really present. 
我们相信，饼的实质发生了变化，与我们主的身体同质，耶稣基督确实临在其中。
That is one truth. 
这是一个事实。
Another is that this Sacrament is also a type of the cross and of glory, and a commemoration of the two. 
另一个是，这圣礼也是十字架和荣耀的预表，也是对两者的纪念。
That is the Catholic faith, which comprehends these two truths which seem opposed. 
这就是天主教信仰，它包含这两个看似对立的真理。
 The heresy of to-day, not conceiving that this Sacrament contains at the same time both the presence of Jesus Christ and a type of Him, and that it is a sacrifice and a commemoration of a sacrifice, believes that neither of these truths can be admitted without excluding the other for this reason. 
当今的异端邪说不认为圣礼同时包含耶稣基督的临在和他的预表，并且认为它是一种牺牲和对牺牲的纪念，他们认为这些真理都不能被证实。承认这一点，但并不排除对方。
 They fasten to this point alone, that this Sacrament is typical; and in this they are not heretics. 
他们只强调这一点：这圣礼是典型的；从这一点来说，他们并不是异端。
They think that we exclude this truth; hence it comes that they raise so many objections to us out of the passages of the Fathers which assert it. 
他们认为我们排除了这个事实；因此，他们从主张这一观点的教父们的段落中向我们提出了如此多的反对意见。
Finally, they deny the presence; and in this they are heretics. 
最后，他们否认了存在；在这一点上他们是异端。
 3rd example: Indulgences. 
第三个例子：赎罪券。
 The shortest way, therefore, to prevent heresies is to instruct in all truths; and the surest way to refute them is to declare them all. 
因此，防止异端的最快捷的方法就是教导一切真理。反驳它们的最可靠方法就是将它们全部声明出来。
For what will the heretics say?  In order to know whether an opinion is a Father's ... 
异教徒会说什么？为了知道某个意见是否是父亲的......
  862  All err the more dangerously, as they each follow a truth. 
第 862 章
Their fault is not in following a falsehood, but in not following another truth. 
他们的错误不在于追随谎言，而在于不追随另一个真理。
  863  Truth is so obscure in these times, and falsehood so established, that unless we love the truth, we cannot know it. 
 863 在这个时代，真理是如此模糊，而谎言又如此根深蒂固，除非我们热爱真理，否则我们无法认识它。
  864  If there is ever a time in which we must make profession of two opposite truths, it is when we are reproached for omitting one. 
 864 如果有一个时刻我们必须承认两个相反的真理，那就是当我们因忽略一个真理而受到指责时。
Therefore the Jesuits and Jansenists are wrong in concealing them, but the Jansenists more so, for the Jesuits have better made profession of the two. 
因此，耶稣会士和詹森主义者隐瞒它们是错误的，但詹森主义者更是如此，因为耶稣会士更好地公开了两者。
  865  Two kinds of people make things equal to one another, as feasts to working days, Christians to priests, all things among them, etc. 
865 有两种人使事物彼此平等，如节日与工作日，基督徒与牧师，等等。
And hence the one party conclude that what is then bad for priests is also so for Christians, and the other that what is not bad for Christians is lawful for priests. 
因此，一方的结论是，对牧师不利的事情对基督徒来说也是如此，而另一方则认为，对基督徒有利的事情对牧师来说是合法的。
  866  If the ancient Church was in error, the Church is fallen. 
 866 如果古代教会犯了错误，那么教会就会堕落。
If she should be in error to-day, it is not the same thing; for she has always the superior maxim of tradition from the hand of the ancient Church; and so this submission and this conformity to the ancient Church prevail and correct all. 
如果她今天犯了错误，那就不是同一回事了。因为她始终拥有来自古代教会的优良传统格言；因此，这种对古代教会的服从和顺从盛行并纠正了一切。
But the ancient Church did not assume the future Church, and did not consider her, as we assume and consider the ancient. 
但古代教会并没有假设未来的教会，也没有像我们假设和考虑古代教会那样考虑她。
  867  That which hinders us in comparing what formerly occurred in the Church with what we see there now, is that we generally look upon Saint Athanasius,[362] Saint Theresa, and the rest, as crowned with glory, and acting towards us as gods. 
 867 阻碍我们将教会中以前发生的事情与我们现在所看到的事情进行比较的是，我们通常将圣亚他那修，[362]圣特蕾莎和其他人视为戴着荣耀的冠冕，并像神一样对待我们。
Now that time has cleared up things, it does so appear. 
现在时间已经澄清了一切，它确实出现了。
But at the time when he was persecuted, this great saint was a man called Athanasius; and Saint Theresa was a nun. 
但在他受迫害的时候，这位伟大的圣人是一个名叫亚他那修的人。圣特蕾莎是一名修女。
Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, says Saint James, to disabuse Christians of that false idea which makes us reject the example of the saints, as disproportioned to our state. 
圣詹姆斯说，埃利亚斯是一个像我们一样受到激情影响的人，他要纠正基督徒的错误观念，这种观念使我们拒绝圣徒的榜样，因为与我们的国家不相称。
"They were saints, say we, ""they are not like us."" What then actually happened? Saint Athanasius was a man called Athanasius, accused of many crimes, condemned by such and such a council for such and such a crime. "
我们说，他们是圣人，“他们与我们不同。”那么到底发生了什么？圣亚他那修是一个名叫亚他那修的人，他被指控犯有许多罪行，并因这样那样的罪行而受到某某议会的谴责。
All the bishops assented to it, and finally the Pope. 
所有主教都同意了，最后是教皇。
What said they to those who opposed this? That they disturbed the peace, that they created schism, etc. 
他们对那些反对的人说了什么？他们扰乱了和平，他们制造了分裂，等等。
 Zeal, light. 
热情，光明。
Four kinds of persons: zeal without knowledge; knowledge without zeal; neither knowledge nor zeal; both zeal and knowledge. 
有四种人：有热心而无知识；没有热忱的知识；既没有知识，也没有热情；热情和知识。
The first three condemned him. 
前三人谴责他。
The last acquitted him, were excommunicated by the Church, and yet saved the Church. 
最后一个人宣告他无罪，被教会逐出教会，但却拯救了教会。
  868  If Saint Augustine came at the present time, and was as little authorised as his defenders, he would accomplish nothing. 
 868 如果圣奥古斯丁此时到来，并且像他的捍卫者一样没有得到授权，他将一事无成。
God directs His Church well, by having sent him before with authority. 
神通过带着权柄派遣他来很好地指导他的教会。
  869  God has not wanted to absolve without the Church. 
 869 上帝不想在没有教会的情况下赦免。
As she has part in the offence, He desires her to have part in the pardon. 
由于她参与了犯罪，他希望她参与赦免。
He associates her with this power, as kings their parliaments. 
他将她与这种权力联系起来，就像国王与议会一样。
But if she absolves or binds without God, she is no longer the Church. 
但如果她在没有上帝的情况下赦免或约束，她就不再是教会了。
For, as in the case of parliament, even if the king have pardoned a man, it must be ratified; but if parliament ratifies without the king, or refuses to ratify on the order of the king, it is no longer the parliament of the king, but a rebellious assembly. 
因为，正如议会的情况一样，即使国王赦免了一个人，也必须得到批准；但如果议会在没有国王的情况下批准，或者拒绝根据国王的命令批准，那么它就不再是国王的议会，而是一个叛逆的议会。
  870  _The Church, the Pope. 
 870 _教会，教皇。
Unity, plurality._--Considering the Church as a unity, the Pope, who is its head, is as the whole. 
统一、多元。_--将教会视为一个整体，作为其首脑的教皇是一个整体。
Considering it as a plurality, the Pope is only a part of it. 
考虑到它是多元的，教皇只是其中的一部分。
The Fathers have considered the Church now in the one way, now in the other. 
教父们现在以一种方式考虑教会，现在以另一种方式考虑教会。
And thus they have spoken differently of the Pope. 
因此他们对教皇的评价也不同。
(Saint Cyprian: _Sacerdos Dei._) But in establishing one of these truths, they have not excluded the other. 
 （圣西普里安：_Sacerdos Dei._）但是在确立其中一个真理时，他们并没有排除另一个。
Plurality which is not reduced to unity is confusion; unity which does not depend on plurality is tyranny. 
复数如果不归结为统一，那就是混乱；不依赖于多数的统一就是暴政。
There is scarcely any other country than France in which it is permissible to say that the Council is above the Pope. 
除了法国之外，几乎没有其他国家可以说大公会议高于教皇。
  871  The Pope is head. 
 871 教皇为首。
Who else is known of all? Who else is recognised by all, having power to insinuate himself into all the body, because he holds the principal shoot, which insinuates itself everywhere? How easy it was to make this degenerate into tyranny! That is why Christ has laid down for them this precept: _Vos autem non sic._[363]   872  The Pope hates and fears the learned, who do not submit to him at will. 
还有谁是众所周知的？还有谁被所有人所认可，拥有将自己渗透到全身的力量，因为他掌握着主芽，而主芽无处不在？多么容易就使之堕落为暴政啊！这就是为什么基督为他们制定了这条戒律：_Vos autem non sic._[363] 872 教皇憎恨并害怕那些不随意服从他的有学问的人。
  873  We must not judge of what the Pope is by some words of the Fathers--as the Greeks said in a council, important rules--but by the acts of the Church and the Fathers, and by the canons. 
873 我们决不能根据教父们的某些言论来判断教皇是什么——正如希腊人在一次会议上所说的，重要的规则——而是根据教会和教父们的行为以及教规来判断。
 _Duo aut tres in unum._[364] Unity and plurality. 
 _Duo aut tres in unum._[364] 统一与多元。
It is an error to exclude one of the two, as the papists do who exclude plurality, or the Huguenots who exclude unity. 
排除两者之一是错误的，就像天主教徒排除多元性或胡格诺派排除统一一样。
  874  Would the Pope be dishonoured by having his knowledge from God and tradition; and is it not dishonouring him to separate him from this holy union?   875  God does not perform miracles in the ordinary conduct of His Church. 
第874章 教皇会因为拥有来自上帝和传统的知识而受到羞辱吗？将他与这个神圣的联盟分开不是对他的侮辱吗？ 875 神不会在他教会的日常行为中创造奇迹。
It would be a strange miracle if infallibility existed in one man. 
如果一个人能够永远正确，那将是一个奇怪的奇迹。
But it appears so natural for it to reside in a multitude, since the conduct of God is hidden under nature, as in all His other works. 
但它存在于众多之中似乎是很自然的，因为上帝的行为隐藏在自然之下，就像他所有其他的工作一样。
  876  Kings dispose of their own power; but the Popes cannot dispose of theirs. 
第876章 国王处置自己的权力；但教皇不能处置他们的。
  877  _Summum jus, summa injuria._  The majority is the best way, because it is visible, and has strength to make itself obeyed. 
第877章 _Summum jus, summa injuria._ 多数是最好的方式，因为它是可见的，并且有力量使自己服从。
Yet it is the opinion of the least able. 
但这是最没有能力的人的意见。
 If men could have done it, they would have placed might in the hands of justice. 
如果人类能够做到这一点，他们就会把权力交给正义。
But as might does not allow itself to be managed as men want, because it is a palpable quality, whereas justice is a spiritual quality of which men dispose as they please, they have placed justice in the hands of might. 
但是，由于强权不允许自己按照人们的意愿来管理，因为它是一种明显的品质，而正义是一种精神品质，人们可以随心所欲地处置它，所以他们把正义置于强权手中。
And thus that is called just which men are forced to obey. 
因此，这就是人们被迫服从的。
 Hence comes the right of the sword, for the sword gives a true right. 
由此而来的是剑的权利，因为剑赋予了真正的权利。
Otherwise we should see violence on one side and justice on the other (end of the twelfth _Provincial_). 
否则我们应该看到一方面是暴力，另一方面是正义（第十二_省_结束）。
Hence comes the injustice of the Fronde,[365] which raises its alleged justice against power. 
因此出现了投石党的不公正，[365]它提出了所谓的反对权力的正义。
It is not the same in the Church, for there is a true justice and no violence. 
在教会里就不一样了，因为那里有真正的正义，没有暴力。
  878  _Injustice._--Jurisdiction is not given for the sake of the judge, but for that of the litigant. 
第878章 _不公正。_--管辖权的授予不是为了法官，而是为了当事人。
It is dangerous to tell this to the people. 
向人们讲述这一点是危险的。
But the people have too much faith in you; it will not harm them, and may serve you. 
但人民对你太信任了；它不会伤害他们，并且可以为你服务。
It should therefore be made known. 
因此应该将其公之于众。
_Pasce oves meas_,[366] non _tuas_. 
 _Pasce oves meas_，[366]非_tuas_。
You owe me pasturage. 
你欠我牧草。
  879  Men like certainty. 
 879 男人喜欢确定性。
They like the Pope to be infallible in faith, and grave doctors to be infallible in morals, so as to have certainty. 
他们喜欢教皇在信仰上无误，喜欢严肃的医生在道德上无误，这样才有确定性。
  880  The Church teaches, and God inspires, both infallibly. 
 880 教会教导，上帝启发，两者都无误。
The work of the Church is of use only as a preparation for grace or condemnation. 
教会的工作只能作为恩典或谴责的准备。
What it does is enough for condemnation, not for inspiration. 
它的所作所为足以引起谴责，而不是激发灵感。
  881  Every time the Jesuits may impose upon the Pope, they will make all Christendom perjured. 
 881 每当耶稣会士强加于教皇时，他们都会让整个基督教世界都作伪证。
 The Pope is very easily imposed upon, because of his occupations, and the confidence which he has in the Jesuits; and the Jesuits are very capable of imposing upon him by means of calumny. 
由于教皇的职业以及他对耶稣会士的信任，教皇很容易被人欺负。耶稣会士非常有能力通过诽谤手段强加给他。
  882  The wretches who have obliged me to speak of the basis of religion. 
 882 这些可怜虫迫使我谈论宗教的基础。
  883  Sinners purified without penitence; the righteous justified without love; all Christians without the grace of Jesus Christ; God without power over the will of men; a predestination without mystery; a redemption without certitude!   884  Any one is made a priest, who wants to be so, as under Jeroboam.[367]  It is a horrible thing that they propound to us the discipline of the Church of to-day as so good, that it is made a crime to desire to change it. 
第883章 罪人不悔罪而净化；义人虽称义，却无爱；所有没有耶稣基督恩典的基督徒；上帝无权凌驾于人的意志之上；毫无神秘的宿命；没有确定性的救赎！ 884 任何人都可以被任命为祭司，只要他愿意，就像耶罗波安统治下的那样。 [367]这是一件可怕的事情，他们向我们提出当今教会的纪律是如此良好，以至于想要改变它就被定为犯罪。
Formerly it was infallibly good, and it was thought that it could be changed without sin; and now, such as it is, we cannot wish it changed! It has indeed been permitted to change the custom of not making priests without such great circumspection, that there were hardly any who were worthy; and it is not allowed to complain of the custom which makes so many who are unworthy!   885  _Heretics._--Ezekiel. 
以前它是绝对正确的，人们认为它可以无罪地改变。现在，我们不能希望它改变！确实，已经允许改变在没有如此谨慎的情况下不任命牧师的习俗，以至于几乎没有人配得上。不允许抱怨这种习俗，它使许多人变得不配！ 885 _异教徒_--以西结。
All the heathen, and also the Prophet, spoke evil of Israel. 
所有的异教徒，包括先知，都诽谤以色列。
"But the Israelites were so far from having the right to say to him, ""You speak like the heathen,"" that he is most forcible upon this, that the heathen say the same as he. "
但以色列人根本没有权利对他说：“你说话像外邦人一样。”他对此极力强行，以至于外邦人也和他说同样的话。
  886  The Jansenists are like the heretics in the reformation of morality; but you are like them in evil. 
 886 詹森派就像道德改革中的异端；但你们却像他们一样作恶。
  887  You are ignorant of the prophecies, if you do not know that all this must happen; princes, prophets, Pope, and even the priests. 
 887 如果你不知道这一切必定发生，你就是对预言一无所知；王子、先知、教皇，甚至牧师。
And yet the Church is to abide. 
然而教会仍要遵守。
By the grace of God we have not come to that. 
靠着上帝的恩典，我们还没有走到这一步。
Woe to these priests! But we hope that God will bestow His mercy upon us that we shall not be of them. 
这些祭司有祸了！但我们希望上帝怜悯我们，使我们不再成为他们的一员。
 Saint Peter, ii: false prophets in the past, the image of future ones. 
圣彼得二世：过去的假先知，未来假先知的形象。
  888  ... 
第888章
So that if it is true, on the one hand, that some lax monks, and some corrupt casuists, who are not members of the hierarchy, are steeped in these corruptions, it is, on the other hand, certain that the true pastors of the Church, who are the true guardians of the Divine Word, have preserved it unchangeably against the efforts of those who have attempted to destroy it. 
因此，如果一方面确实有一些松懈的僧侣和一些腐败的诡辩家，他们不是等级制度的成员，却深陷这些腐败之中，那么另一方面，可以肯定的是，真正的牧师教会是圣言的真正守护者，它不可改变地保存着它，以对抗那些试图摧毁它的人。
 And thus true believers have no pretext to follow that laxity, which is only offered to them by the strange hands of these casuists, instead of the sound doctrine which is presented to them by the fatherly hands of their own pastors. 
因此，真正的信徒没有借口去遵循这种松懈，这种松懈只是由这些诡辩家的奇怪之手提供给他们的，而不是由他们自己的牧师慈父之手向他们呈现的健全教义。
And the ungodly and heretics have no ground for publishing these abuses as evidence of imperfection in the providence of God over His Church; since, the Church consisting properly in the body of the hierarchy, we are so far from being able to conclude from the present state of matters that God has abandoned her to corruption, that it has never been more apparent than at the present time that God visibly protects her from corruption. 
不敬虔的人和异端分子没有理由发表这些滥用职权的行为，以此作为上帝对教会的旨意不完美的证据。既然教会正确地由等级制度组成，我们还远远不能从目前的情况得出上帝已经抛弃她去腐败的结论，现在是最明显的时候，上帝已经抛弃了她。明显保护她免受腐败侵害。
 For if some of these men, who, by an extraordinary vocation, have made profession of withdrawing from the world and adopting the monks' dress, in order to live in a more perfect state than ordinary Christians, have fallen into excesses which horrify ordinary Christians, and have become to us what the false prophets were among the Jews; this is a private and personal misfortune, which must indeed be deplored, but from which nothing can be inferred against the care which God takes of His Church; since all these things are so clearly foretold, and it has been so long since announced that these temptations would arise from people of this kind; so that when we are well instructed, we see in this rather evidence of the care of God than of His forgetfulness in regard to us. 
因为，如果这些人中的一些人，出于非凡的使命，声称要远离尘世，穿上僧侣的服装，以便生活在比普通基督徒更完美的状态中，那么，他们是否已经陷入了令普通基督徒感到恐惧的过度行为中呢？ ，对我们来说就像犹太人中的假先知一样；这是一种私人的、个人的不幸，确实必须感到遗憾，但从中并不能推断出上帝对他的教会的关怀。因为所有这些事情都已被如此清楚地预言过，而且很久以前就宣布这些诱惑将来自于这类人；因此，当我们受到良好的教导时，我们会从中看到上帝的看顾，而不是他对我们的遗忘。
  889  Tertullian: _Nunquam Ecclesia reformabitur._   890  Heretics, who take advantage of the doctrine of the Jesuits, must be made to know that it is not that of the Church [_the doctrine of the Church_], and that our divisions do not separate us from the altar. 
第889章 特图良：_Nunquam Ecclesia Reformabitur._ 第890章 那些利用耶稣会教义的异端分子，必须知道它不是教会的教义[_教会的教义_]，而且我们的分歧并没有将我们分开从祭坛上。
  891  If in differing we condemned, you would be right. 
第891章：如果我们谴责不同意见，你就是对的。
Uniformity without diversity is useless to others; diversity without uniformity is ruinous for us. 
没有多样性的统一对别人来说是没有用的；缺乏统一性的多样性对我们来说是毁灭性的。
The one is harmful outwardly; the other inwardly. 
一者外在有害，一者有害。另一个是内心的。
  892  By showing the truth, we cause it to be believed; but by showing the injustice of ministers, we do not correct it. 
第892章但通过展示大臣的不公正，我们并不纠正它。
Our mind is assured by a proof of falsehood; our purse is not made secure by proof of injustice. 
我们的心因虚假的证据而得到保证；我们的钱包并不能通过不公正的证据来保证安全。
  893  Those who love the Church lament to see the corruption of morals; but laws at least exist. 
 893 热爱教会的人哀叹道德的败坏；但至少法律是存在的。
But these corrupt the laws. 
但这些都破坏了法律。
The model is damaged. 
模型已损坏。
  894  Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction. 
 894 人们从来没有像出于宗教信仰那样彻底而愉快地行恶。
  895  It is in vain that the Church has established these words, anathemas, heresies, etc. 
895 教会确立这些言论、咒骂、异端等都是徒劳的。
They are used against her. 
他们被用来对付她。
  896  The servant knoweth not what his lord doeth, for the master tells him only the act and not the intention.[368] And this is why he often obeys slavishly, and defeats the intention. 
 896 仆人不知道主人做什么，因为主人只告诉他行为，而不告诉他意图。[368]这就是为什么他常常盲目服从，而违背初衷。
But Jesus Christ has told us the object. 
但耶稣基督已经告诉了我们这个目标。
And you defeat that object. 
然后你打败了那个物体。
  897  They cannot have perpetuity, and they seek universality; and therefore they make the whole Church corrupt, that they may be saints. 
 897 他们不能拥有永恒，他们寻求普遍性；因此，他们使整个教会腐败，以便他们成为圣徒。
  898  _Against those who misuse passages of Scripture, and who pride themselves in finding one which seems to favour their error._--The chapter for Vespers, Passion Sunday, the prayer for the king. 
 898_反对那些误用圣经段落的人，以及那些以找到似乎支持他们的错误的经文而自豪的人。_-晚祷章，受难主日，为国王祈祷。
" Explanation of these words: ""He that is not with me is against me.""[369] And of these others: ""He that is not against you is for you.""[370] A person who says: ""I am neither for nor against"", we ought to reply to him ... "
这些话的解释：“不与我同在的人就是反对我的。”[369] 而其他这些话的解释：“不反对你的人就是支持你的。”[370] 一个人说：“我既不支持你，也不支持你。”也不反对”，我们应该回复他......
  899  He who will give the meaning of Scripture, and does not take it from Scripture, is an enemy of Scripture. 
899 凡是赋予《圣经》意义而不从《圣经》中取用的人，就是《圣经》的敌人。

"Christ._)   900  _Humilibus dat gratiam; an ideo non dedit humilitatem?[371]  Sui eum non receperunt; quotquot autem non receperunt an non erant sui?_[372]   901  ""It must indeed be,"" says Feuillant, ""that this is not so certain; for controversy indicates uncertainty, (Saint Athanasius, Saint Chrysostom, morals, unbelievers).""  The Jesuits have not made the truth uncertain, but they have made their own ungodliness certain. "
 [第 900 章] [371] Sui eum non receperunt; an ideo non deedit humilitatem？ quotquot autem non receperunt an non erant sui？_[372] 901 “确实，”费扬说，“这不是那么确定；因为争议表明不确定性，（圣阿塔那修、圣金口、道德、不信者）。”耶稣会士并没有使真理变得不确定，但他们却使自己的不敬虔变得确定。
 Contradiction has always been permitted, in order to blind the wicked; for all that offends truth or love is evil. 
为了蒙蔽恶人，矛盾总是被允许的。因为一切冒犯真理或爱的事物都是邪恶的。
This is the true principle. 
这才是真正的原则。
  902  All religions and sects in the world have had natural reason for a guide. 
 902 世界上所有的宗教和教派都有自然的理由来指导。
Christians alone have been constrained to take their rules from without themselves, and to acquaint themselves with those which Jesus Christ bequeathed to men of old to be handed down to true believers. 
只有基督徒被迫从外部获取规则，并熟悉耶稣基督遗赠给古人并传给真正信徒的规则。
This constraint wearies these good Fathers. 
这种限制让这些好父亲们感到疲倦。
They desire, like other people, to have liberty to follow their own imaginations. 
和其他人一样，他们渴望拥有追随自己想象力的自由。
"It is in vain that we cry to them, as the prophets said to the Jews of old: ""Enter into the Church; acquaint yourselves with the precepts which the men of old left to her, and follow those paths."" They have answered like the Jews: ""We will not walk in them; but we will follow the thoughts of our hearts""; and they have said, ""We will be as the other nations.""[373]   903  They make a rule of exception. "
我们向他们呼喊是徒劳的，就像先知对古代犹太人所说的那样：“进入教会；熟悉古人留给她的戒律，并遵循这些道路。”他们像犹太人一样回答：“我们不会遵行它们，但我们会追随我们内心的想法”；他们说：“我们将像其他国家一样。”[373] 903 他们制定了例外规则。
 Have the men of old given absolution before penance? Do this as exceptional. 
古人在忏悔之前有赦免吗？将此视为例外。
But of the exception you make a rule without exception, so that you do not even want the rule to be exceptional. 
但是对于例外，你制定了无例外的规则，因此你甚至不希望该规则成为例外。
  904  _On confessions and absolutions without signs of regret._  God regards only the inward; the Church judges only by the outward. 
904_论无悔意的忏悔和赦免。_上帝只考虑内在；教会只根据外在来判断。
God absolves as soon as He sees penitence in the heart; the Church when she sees it in works. 
神一看到人心有悔罪，就赦免他；当她在作品中看到教会时。
God will make a Church pure within, which confounds, by its inward and entirely spiritual holiness, the inward impiety of proud sages and Pharisees; and the Church will make an assembly of men whose external manners are so pure as to confound the manners of the heathen. 
上帝将使教会的内部纯洁，教会以其内在和完全精神上的圣洁，挫败了骄傲的圣人和法利赛人内心的不敬虔；教会将召集一群外在举止纯洁得足以使异教徒的举止相形见绌的人。
If there are hypocrites among them, but so well disguised that she does not discover their venom, she tolerates them; for, though they are not accepted of God, whom they cannot deceive, they are of men, whom they do deceive. 
如果他们中间有伪君子，但他们伪装得很好，以至于她没有发现他们的恶毒，她就会容忍他们；因为，虽然他们不被上帝接受，他们无法欺骗上帝，但他们却属于人类，他们确实欺骗了上帝。
And thus she is not dishonoured by their conduct, which appears holy. 
因此，她并没有因为他们看似神圣的行为而蒙羞。
But you want the Church to judge neither of the inward, because that belongs to God alone, nor of the outward, because God dwells only upon the inward; and thus, taking away from her all choice of men, you retain in the Church the most dissolute, and those who dishonour her so greatly, that the synagogues of the Jews and sects of philosophers would have banished them as unworthy, and have abhorred them as impious. 
但你希望教会既不评判内在的，因为那只属于神，也不评判外在的，因为神只住在内在；因此，剥夺了她对男人的所有选择，你在教会中保留了最放荡的人，以及那些极大地羞辱她的人，以至于犹太人的会堂和哲学家的教派会认为他们不配而将他们驱逐，并憎恶他们一样不虔诚。
  905  The easiest conditions to live in according to the world are the most difficult to live in according to God, and vice versa. 
 905 按照世界的观点生活最容易的条件，按照上帝的观点生活是最困难的，反之亦然。
Nothing is so difficult according to the world as the religious life; nothing is easier than to live it according to God. 
对世人来说，没有什么比宗教生活更困难的了。没有什么比按照神而活更容易的了。
Nothing is easier, according to the world, than to live in high office and great wealth; nothing is more difficult than to live in them according to God, and without acquiring an interest in them and a liking for them. 
在世人看来，没有什么比居高位和巨额财富更容易的了。没有什么比按照神而活在其中，却不对它们产生兴趣和喜爱更困难的了。
  906  The casuists submit the decision to the corrupt reason, and the choice of decisions to the corrupt will, in order that all that is corrupt in the nature of man may contribute to his conduct. 
906 诡辩论者将决定交给腐败的理性，将决定的选择交给腐败的意志，以便人性中的一切腐败都有助于他的行为。
  907  But is it _probable_ that _probability_ gives assurance?  Difference between rest and security of conscience. 
第907章休息和良心安全之间的区别。
Nothing gives certainty but truth; nothing gives rest but the sincere search for truth. 
除了真理之外，没有什么可以给予确定性；除了真诚地寻求真理之外，没有什么可以让人休息。
  908  The whole society itself of their casuists cannot give assurance to a conscience in error, and that is why it is important to choose good guides. 
 908 他们的诡辩者的整个社会本身不能保证良心的错误，这就是为什么选择好的指导者很重要。
 Thus they will be doubly culpable, both in having followed ways which they should not have followed, and in having listened to teachers to whom they should not have listened. 
因此，他们将承担双重罪责，一方面是因为他们遵循了他们不应该遵循的道路，另一方面是因为他们听从了他们不应该听从的老师的话。
  909  Can it be anything but compliance with the world which makes you find things probable? Will you make us believe that it is truth, and that if duelling were not the fashion, you would find it probable that they might fight, considering the matter in itself?   910  Must we kill to prevent there being any wicked? This is to make both parties wicked instead of one. 
第909章 不是顺从世界，就能让你发现事情有可能吗？你能让我们相信这是事实，如果决斗不是流行的话，考虑到事情本身，你会发现他们可能会打架吗？第910章 一定要杀戮才能杜绝恶人吗？这是使双方都邪恶而不是一方邪恶。
_Vince in bono malum._[374] (Saint Augustine.)   911  _Universal._--Ethics and language are special, but universal sciences. 
 _Vince in bono malum._[374]（圣奥古斯丁。）911 _Universal._--伦理和语言是特殊的，但却是普遍的科学。
  912  _Probability._--Each one can employ it; no one can take it away.

It is because they have exceeded all bounds. 
因为他们已经超越了一切界限。
Again, there are many people who see the truth, and who cannot attain to it; but there are few who do not know that the purity of religion is opposed to our corruptions. 
再说了，有很多人看到了真理，却无法达到；但很少有人不知道宗教的纯洁性与我们的腐败是对立的。
It is absurd to say that an eternal recompense is offered to the morality of Escobar. 
说埃斯科瓦尔的道德得到永恒的报应是荒谬的。
  915  _Probability._--They have some true principles; but they misuse them. 
第915章_概率_--他们有一些真正的原则；但他们滥用了它们。
Now, the abuse of truth ought to be as much punished as the introduction of falsehood. 
现在，滥用真理应该像引入谎言一样受到惩罚。
 As if there were two hells, one for sins against love, the other for those against justice!   916  _Probability._[376]--The earnestness of the saints in seeking the truth was useless, if the probable is trustworthy. 
仿佛有两个地狱，一个是违背爱的罪，另一个是违背正义的罪！ 916_概率._[376]--如果概率是可信的，圣徒们寻求真理的热忱是没有用的。
The fear of the saints who have always followed the surest way (Saint Theresa having always followed her confessor). 
对始终遵循最可靠道路的圣徒的恐惧（圣特蕾莎始终追随她的忏悔神父）。
  917  Take away _probability_, and you can no longer please the world; give _probability_, and you can no longer displease it. 
第917章 拿走概率，你就无法再取悦世界；给_概率_，你就不能再让它不高兴了。
  918  These are the effects of the sins of the peoples and of the Jesuits. 
 918 这些是人民和耶稣会士的罪恶的后果。
The great have wished to be flattered. 
伟人都希望被奉承。
The Jesuits have wished to be loved by the great. 
耶稣会士希望受到伟人的爱戴。
They have all been worthy to be abandoned to the spirit of lying, the one party to deceive, the others to be deceived. 
他们都值得被抛弃在说谎的精神中，一方欺骗，另一方被欺骗。
They have been avaricious, ambitious, voluptuous. 
他们贪婪、野心勃勃、淫荡。
_Coacervabunt tibi magistros._[377] Worthy disciples of such masters, they have sought flatterers, and have found them. 
 _Coacervabunt tibi magistros._[377] 这些大师的值得弟子，他们寻找阿谀奉承者，并且找到了他们。
  919  If they do not renounce their doctrine of probability, their good maxims are as little holy as the bad, for they are founded on human authority; and thus, if they are more just, they will be more reasonable, but not more holy. 
 919 如果他们不放弃概率学说，那么他们好的格言就和坏的格言一样不神圣，因为它们是建立在人类权威之上的；因此，如果他们更加公正，他们就会更加合理，但不会更加神圣。
They take after the wild stem on which they are grafted. 
它们模仿了嫁接的野生茎。
 If what I say does not serve to enlighten you, it will be of use to the people. 
我说的如果不能启发你们，那就对人民有用了。
 If these[378] are silent, the stones will speak. 
如果这些[378]保持沉默，石头就会说话。
 Silence is the greatest persecution; the saints were never silent. 
沉默是最大的迫害；圣人们从来没有沉默过。
It is true that a call is necessary; but it is not from the decrees of the Council that we must learn whether we are called, it is from the necessity of speaking. 
确实需要打电话；但我们必须根据发言的需要来了解我们是否被召唤，而不是根据大公会议的法令。
Now, after Rome has spoken, and we think that she has condemned the truth, and that they have written it, and after the books which have said the contrary are censured; we must cry out so much the louder, the more unjustly we are censured, and the more violently they would stifle speech, until there come a Pope who hears both parties, and who consults antiquity to do justice. 
现在，在罗马发表讲话之后，我们认为她已经谴责了真理，并且他们写下了真理，并且在那些提出相反观点的书籍受到谴责之后；我们必须大声呼喊，我们受到的谴责越不公正，他们就会越猛烈地压制言论，直到出现一位听取双方意见并参考古代文献以伸张正义的教皇。
So the good Popes will find the Church still in outcry. 
因此，善良的教皇会发现教会仍然在强烈抗议。
 The Inquisition and the Society[379] are the two scourges of the truth. 
宗教裁判所和社团[379]是真理的两大祸害。
 Why do you not accuse them of Arianism? For, though they have said that Jesus Christ is God, perhaps they mean by it not the natural interpretation, but as it is said, _Dii estis_. 
你为什么不指责他们阿里乌派呢？因为，尽管他们说耶稣基督是神，也许他们的意思不是自然的解释，而是正如所说的，_Dii estis_。
 If my Letters are condemned at Rome, that which I condemn in them is condemned in heaven. 
如果我的书信在罗马受到谴责，那么我在信中所谴责的东西也会在天上受到谴责。
_Ad tuum, Domine Jesu, tribunal appello._  You yourselves are corruptible. 
 _Ad tuum，Domine Jesu，法庭上诉。_你们自己是腐败的。
 I feared that I had written ill, seeing myself condemned; but the example of so many pious writings makes me believe the contrary. 
我担心自己写得不好，看到自己受到谴责；但这么多虔诚著作的例子让我相信事实恰恰相反。
"It is no longer allowable to write well, so corrupt or ignorant is the Inquisition!  ""It is better to obey God than men.""  I fear nothing; I hope for nothing. "
不再允许写得好，宗教裁判所如此腐败或无知！ “服从上帝比服从人更好。”我什么都不怕；我什么都不希望。
It is not so with the bishops. 
主教们的情况却并非如此。
Port-Royal fears, and it is bad policy to disperse them; for they will fear no longer and will cause greater fear. 
皇家港的恐惧，驱散它们是糟糕的政策；因为他们将不再恐惧，反而会引起更大的恐惧。
I do not even fear your like censures, if they are not founded on those of tradition. 
我什至不担心你的类似谴责，如果它们不是建立在传统的基础上的话。
Do you censure all? What! even my respect? No. 
你谴责所有人吗？什么！甚至我的尊重？不。
Say then what, or you will do nothing, if you do not point out the evil, and why it is evil. 
那就说什么吧，否则，如果你不指出罪恶以及为什么它是罪恶的话，你什么也做不了。
And this is what they will have great difficulty in doing. 
而这正是他们很难做到的。
 _Probability._--They have given a ridiculous explanation of certitude; for, after having established that all their ways are sure, they have no longer called that sure which leads to heaven without danger of not arriving there by it, but that which leads there without danger of going out of that road. 
_概率._--他们对确定性给出了荒谬的解释；因为，在确定了他们所有的道路都是可靠的之后，他们不再称那条通向天堂且没有无法到达那里的危险的道路是确定的，而是称那条通向天堂且没有离开那条路的危险的道路。

_The difference between the mathematical and the     intuitive mind._--Pascal is here distinguishing the logical or     discursive type of mind, a good example of which is found in     mathematical reasoning, and what we should call the intuitive type     of mind, which sees everything at a glance. 
 _数学思维和直觉思维之间的区别。_--帕斯卡在这里区分了逻辑或推论类型的思维（数学推理中可以找到一个很好的例子）和我们应该称之为直觉类型的思维（它可以看到一切）乍看上去。
A practical man of sound     judgment exemplifies the latter; for he is in fact guided by     impressions of past experience, and does not consciously reason from     general principles.

根据帕斯卡的说法，任何不是从反思性思维中产生的东西都是一种必要机制的产物，这种机制植根于身体，并通过想象和激情延续到心灵中。
It is      therefore necessary for man so to alter, and adjust this mechanism,      that it will always follow, and not obstruct, the good will.

In the French edition on which this translation is based       there was inserted the following fragment after No. 
在该译文所依据的法文版本中，在第 1 号之后插入了以下片段。
"513:          ""Work out your own salvation with fear.""          Proofs of prayer. "
 513：“带着恐惧去实现你自己的救赎。”祈祷的证据。
_Petenti dabitur._          Therefore it is in our power to ask. 
 _Petenti dabitur._ 因此我们有权提出要求。
On the other hand, there is         God. 
另一方面，还有上帝。
So it is not in our power, since the obtaining of (the         grace) to pray to Him is not in our power. 
所以这不在我们的能力范围内，因为获得向他祈祷的（恩典）不在我们的能力范围内。
For since salvation         is not in us, and the obtaining of such grace is from Him,         prayer is not in our power. 
因为救恩不在我们里面，而且这种恩典是从他那里获得的，所以祷告不在我们的能力之内。
         The righteous man should then hope no more in God, for he ought         not to hope, but to strive to obtain what he wants. 
那么，义人就不应该再对神抱有希望，因为他不应该抱有希望，而应该努力去获得他想要的东西。
         Let us conclude then that, since man is now unrighteous since         the first sin, and God is unwilling that he should thereby not         be estranged from Him, it is only by a first effect that he is         not estranged. 
那么我们可以得出这样的结论：既然人从第一次犯罪以来就是不义的，而神不愿意人因此与他疏远，所以只有第一个结果他才没有疏远。
         Therefore, those who depart from God have not this first effect         without which they are not estranged from God, and those who do         not depart from God have this first effect. 
所以，离开神的人没有这第一个果效，没有这第一个果效，他们就不会与神疏远；而那些不离开神的人，就有这个第一个果效。
Therefore, those         whom we have seen possessed for some time of grace by this first         effect, cease to pray, for want of this first effect. 
因此，我们所看到的那些因这第一个果效而暂时拥有恩典的人，会因为缺乏第一个果效而停止祷告。
         Then God abandons the first in this sense. 
那么上帝就从这个意义上放弃了第一个。
         It is doubtful, however that this fragment should be included in         the _Pensées_, and it has seemed best to separate it from the         text. 
然而，这个片段是否应该包含在《回忆录》中是值得怀疑的，而且似乎最好将其与文本分开。
It has only once before appeared--in the edition of         Michaut (1896). 
它之前只出现过一次——在 Michaut 的版本（1896 年）中。
The first half of it has been freely translated         in order to give an interpretation in accordance with a         suggestion from M. 
为了按照M.的建议进行解释，前半部分已自由翻译。
Emile Boutroux, the eminent authority on         Pascal. 
埃米尔·布特鲁（Emile Boutroux），帕斯卡研究的杰出权威。
The meaning seems to be this. 
意思好像是这个。
In one sense it is in our         power to ask from God, who promises to give us what we ask. 
从某种意义上说，我们有能力向上帝祈求，上帝承诺给我们我们所求的东西。
But,         in another sense, it is not in our power to ask; for it is not         in our power to obtain the grace which is necessary in asking. 
但是，从另一种意义上说，我们无权去问；我们不能去问。因为我们没有能力通过祈求获得必要的恩典。
        We know that salvation is not in our power. 
我们知道救恩不在我们的能力之内。
Therefore some         condition of salvation is not in our power. 
因此，拯救的某些条件不在我们的能力之内。
Now the conditions         of salvation are two: (1) The asking for it, and (2) the         obtaining it. 
得救的条件有两个：（1）要求它，（2）得到它。
But God promises to give us what we ask. 
但神应许会给我们所求的。
Hence the         obtaining is in our power. 
因此，获取是在我们的能力范围内。
Therefore the condition which is not         in our power must be the first, namely, the asking. 
因此，我们无能为力的条件必须是第一个，即请求。
Prayer         presupposes a grace which it is not within our power to obtain. 
祈祷的前提是我们无法获得的恩典。
         After giving the utmost consideration to the second half of this         obscure fragment, and seeking assistance from some eminent         scholars, the translator has been compelled to give a strictly         literal translation of it, without attempting to make sense. 
在对这段晦涩片段的后半部分进行了充分考虑，并寻求了一些著名学者的帮助后，译者不得不对其进行严格的直译，而不试图理解其意义。
